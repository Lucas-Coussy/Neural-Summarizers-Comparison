The layer of ice on Tracy's body began to melt, but the invisible spider Webs continued to bind her firmly, preventing her from doing anything. After a few seconds, she didn't feel the pain she expected. Instead, she heard Gehrmen Sparrow say in a deep voice, \"Say this: No one is to disturb me.\" Tracy was surprised as she felt perplexed, and it showed on her face. The pirates didn't have any doubts about this. It was as if they were following a specific pattern. They instinctively avoided the captain's cabin and continued their work. Since the captain said not to disturb her, they naturally wouldn't seek her out. She had obtained the environment of \"not being disturbed\" just as she wanted. This meant that Demoness of WhiteKatarina was still in Backlund, in search of a particular target.",

The group was made up of a bare-chested man with a hideous blue sea serpent tattooed on his arm and short streaks of red paint painted on the sides of his cheeks, chest, and abdomen. The men were dressed in dark blue Taraba shirts and more or less had red paint on their bare skin. Some of them had revolvers at their waists, some carried gray steel backpacks and long, thick high-pressure steam rifles. They formed a semicircle around Klein and Danitz, who had just entered the room and were talking to the man in the room. Klein: \"The Beyonder nature of this world is filled with madness and twistedness. A \"deity\" still in the primitive stage of sacrifice is basically unable to resist this trend. It's quite obvious what kind of style they follow...Without a word, Klein followed Danitz into the room.\" Danitz was stunned for a moment before forcing out a laugh. \"Dogshit! Am I so bad at disguising myself?\" he roared inwardly, unwilling to accept the fact. \"How else would they be dead?\" Klein retorted. \"I heard that you killed Steel and Blood Brambles?\" Danitz retorted without hesitation. \"It could be very well well well be very dangerous.\" \"Yes,\" Klein replied, \"I'm sure it is.\"",

The region it was in had dark-blue seawater which was almost black was ebbing slightly. Even the seawater didn't show any corresponding signs of its existence. The Card of Blasphemy could be used to create a potion to advance to Sequence 4. It could also be bestowed to the Rorsted Archipelago's Resistance in the future to raise their survivability at sea. It was likely a powerful man who had once been active at sea before suddenly vanishing. The Church of Storms would definitely suspect that this powerful missing man had obtained the Card ofblasphemy. If this method doesn't work, the Church doesn't have a Sealed Artifact that can wipe out the corresponding ingredients and prepare the ritual. Once I become a sequence 4, I'll immediately leave the Church and become a Pirate King. It's up to you to say how many times it counts... Alger didn't retort, nor did he plan on objecting to Gehrman Sparrow's claim. \"I'll give it to you in thefuture,\" he said. \"No problem.\"",

Emlyn aimed his Vision of White at the Shaman King's left chest and prepared to activate the Sun domain's \"Unshadowed Spear\" But at this moment, Klar man suddenly underwent a transformation. A crack quickly split open in the middle of his forehead, as if there was a blood moon embedded in it. His stiff and slow movements barely restored to normal and, under the radiance of the full moon, he turned into a pool of blood. The illusory, blonde, blue-eyed Sharron then floated out of his body uncontrollably. She was a Grade 1 Sealed Eye-less Piligless, an item formed by the Rose School of Thought. It was a Sequence 4 demod of the Mutant pathway who had suffered a sudden death due to an accident. It could possess a living objects with spirits that didn't awaken according to its willer's will. The entire port city was illuminated with a blinding white beam. It then burst into an intense light, melting away all the undead, darkness, and evil.

This is truly blasphemous... Could the main ingredients of the final potion be the godhood, divine blood, and body of the Eternal Blazing Sun? The information on the diary's last page was filled with so much information that Klein almost couldn't think. The cards of Blasphemy he created were standardized with the names of the potions. These can no longer be called potions. Could the reason that the Emperor regretted not choosing the Seer, Apprentice, Marauder pathways be because their corresponding Sequence 0s have yet to appear? Then what was the reason for the sudden personification of the Hidden Sage who was symbolically a deity? It feels like he became the enemy of everyone in the world, and that only seems possible if it was set into motion by that mysterious and ancient organization. The Sun's request could be used for three years, perfectly matching the requirements described by The Sun earlier. The World's request was to obtain the true root of a Mist Treant, at least 60 milliliters of its juice, as well as the Spring of the Elves marrow crystals and the complete spinal fluid of a Dark Patterned Black Panther. It was to be exchanged for a weapon that meets your requirements as soon as possible.",

He recalled the blue, thumb-sized blood sphere that was suspended beside the corpse of the suited clown. The endless darkness in his mind was illuminated in that instant. The Captain suddenly understood many things, figuring out why the Beyonder pathways wouldn't be broken, even if the creatures used as main ingredients were going extinct. His powers now are not too different from a Sequence 6's. That's also why I dared to deal with Madam Sharon. He finally understood why he couldn't come up with a logical explanation despite his best efforts. It was because he didn't have all the relevant information and was unable to fill in the blanks. \"I really can't bear to part with them. I truly am a selfish person,\" he said. \"Don't worry about me. Adelaide, Dwayne, Hitte, and Kenley are all fighting alongside me, no matter what",
        "104": "Danitz was shocked and confused as to how this matter had been discovered by an outsider. He had never told anyone, and he had kept this secret very well hidden. Klein turned to the radio transceiver which was connected to the magic mirror, Arrodes, and said in a low voice, \"I have some questions\" White paper spat out of the radio Transceiver amid clacking sounds. \"Who said that that mind wouldn't definitely mind that you're in the Golden Dream?\" \"Of course, you definitely wouldn't!\" Klein replied. \"I would be too embarrassed to adventure out at sea! No, I would betoo embarrassed to return to theGolden Dream!\" \"You're too obsequious and too shameless... Why do I have a nagging feeling that there's a problem?\" \"Yes, Master!\" Arrode used an exclamation mark. \"You can use any form to address me.\" \"This is my honor. Can I address you as Master? The great existence above the spirit world?\" \"No, Master.\" \"What is your name?\" \"Arrodes\" \"I await the next opportunity to be at your service, great Master\" \"There are reared mermaids in the Church of Evernight's headquarters, in the Cathedral of Serenity, as well as the Sleep Cathedral on Dinos Island.\" \"The former is too dangerous. The latter can be considered. Transform into a Nighthawk or a bishop and listen",
        "105": "Alger was stunned for a second before he realized what Miss Justice was talking about. The limits of his mind were widened, and he felt that there was room for exploitation. He asked, \"Ladies and gentlemen, which one of you has a way or item to make everyone on board a ship sleep at the same time?\" Audrey, Fors, and Derrick either shook their heads in response or answered with \"no\" The Sun had to spend two to three months or more time traveling and adventuring on the Sonia Sea. This long period of time was long enough for The Sun to obtain a potion formula, gather the corresponding ingredients, and ascend to the Sequence 7 Solar High Priest. The Man ruminated over the words of Miss Justice's question: Why did the two cases be one and the same? The truth behind all this involves the disappearance of the slaves. He felt that he could vaguely see some key points that he felt were key points to the truth behind this case. He decided to go to the City of Silver to find out what the truth was about Backlund's Great Smog. The 100 pounds in cash will be paid tomorrow,\" Alger calmly said his thanks. The World laughed and turned to look at The Sun. Audrey remembered something from their conversation. It was something that originated from the Psychology Alchemists. The most important thing is that they were founded after excavating the ruins of Hermes, who was the master who created ancient Hermes.",
        "106": "Klein felt as if he had returned to Tingen, back to the Blackthorn Security Company, and was about to activate his Spirit Vision to observe Megose and the baby in her womb. The fear that resulted from his instinct was so clear that it felt like a giant hand tightly gripping onto his heart. He finally understood that the thing interfering with the gray fog and his divinations wasn't a Grade 0 Sealed Artifact or a mystical item of the same level. There was something even more terrifying hidden within Trissy's body. She was the symbol of the apocalypse, the Primordial Demoness! No, she isn't the Primordialdemoness yet. Otherwise, I would've already lost control just by being together with her, turning into a pile of squirming rotten meat! She's in a very strange state...Trissy's brows eased as her eyes regained their focus. She laughed and said, \"If you can inform the Nighthawks, the Mandated Punishers, and the Machinery Hivemind about this matter, and I happen to meet you before they arrest me, I don't mind letting you know what true pleasure is.\" With that, her figure quickly disappeared, as if someone had wiped it away with a rag. Klein silently sighed, raised his head, looked at the carriage's wooden roof, and said: \"I believe that you will fight with all your might for the sake of your own life. You have great hope!\"",
        "107": "Bayam, inside the Church of the Sea God. Alger Wilson was an attendant more suitable to wield the authority, helping the deity listen and respond to prayer without enjoying the corresponding anchors and identity. The Sea God Scepter's owner was still Klein, as everything still pointed at him. This was the miraculous use of \"Grafting\" and transfer the concept of \"Sea God\" which was directed at him and Sefirah Castle to Alger. It would allow him to directly become half a Sea God, allowing him to better adapt to his identity and better act in advance. It will only make the wielder more irritable and cause the blood of the creatures to be a drain on his spirit. In addition, it will also make the fly to the uninhabited island or an uninhabite island every month. You can use it to concoct the Cataclysmic Interrer potion, which will reduce the difficulty of advancing. That's what the scepter had told him before asking what powers the Beyonder had. It was Gehrman Sparrow in a top hat and trench coat. He habitually acted as the Attendant of Mysteries. He said, \"I have come under Mr. Fool's orders.\" Alger immediately lowered his head and pressed his right hand to his left chest. He was extremely certain that the white bone scpter before him was the symbol. He began analyzing the possible developments at the main peak of the Hornacis mountain range when he",
        "108": "Melissa looked at her brother with a serious expression because she felt that Klein's behavior tonight was strange as well. In fact, it only looked slightly more normal than Elizabeth's behavior and, later, Selena's. Klein chuckled as he had long thought of an excuse and said, \"There was a mistake in one of the document descriptions, and I can either amend it now since it's on the way or wake up at least half an hour earlier tomorrow morning\" The three siblings bid their hosts farewell before hiring a carriage nearby. The two-wheeled horse carriage was traveling quickly in the dark, quiet street. They arrived at Zouteland Street in only twelve minutes. Klein got off the carriage and knocked on the door of the Blackthorn Security Company. Within ten seconds, the door was opened wide. Leonard Mitchell appeared before him in a vest and shirt. \"I have something to report,\" he said simply. \"Klein was only on guard duty once a week for the Chanis Gate. They maintained a regular work schedule for the rest of the time. As for emergencies that happened at night, they would be dealt with by the Sleepless who enjoyed the night. However, only getting two to three hours of sleep a day can cause baldness and memory loss...Whenever he thought about this, Klein couldn't help but ridicule Captain Dunn Smith in his mind\" It didn't want to awaken or possess Selena ahead of time; therefore, as long as",
        "109": "Alger raised the lantern in his hand, lighting up the area up ahead with a limited dim yellow glow. Klein felt a chill down his back when he saw their eyeballs watching him without moving, having made the connection that they were once alive. He felt that darkness ruled the depths of this passageway, as though a terrifying monster had widened its mouth as it lay in wait for the two to walk into its belly. The duo continued ahead as they tried hard to soften their steps. However, there were still some echoes that reverberated in that extremely silent environment. Then, Klein saw a figure nearly four meters tall walk out. Its head had goat horns and a mouth that resembled a hound's. Its half-opened mouth revealing snarling fangs. And what attracted attention the most were its pair of eyes which burned red and the six pairs of white-membraned wings. It was a six-winged gargoyle! Its core crystal was one of the main ingredients of a Marionettist, and the Beyonder powers it possessed were extremely special and indefensible. It's no wonder Qilangos was able to venture down and return safely.... It's a wonder it's no longer able to return to the Qilagos' home world. The gargoyle didn't look towards the duo and instead passed through the passedageway slowly distancing themselves from them. The tomb's humidity was soaked with water droplets, a clear indication of the room",
        "110": "Klein looked over and saw the person inquiring about the cow teeth paeonol. Only two or three amulets released the faint light out of the dozens that were laid before him. Some of the amulet had a weak aura emanating from them, some crimson, some pale white, some golden. This meant that some of them had weak traces of spirituality and were definitely effective to a certain extent. Klein wanted to transform the half-completed amulements into true amuleted. He wanted to make two amuletts that can protect a person from danger, one each for Benson and Melissa. As for my own, I can ask the Nighthawks to supply me with the ingredients... Man, I must have been influenced by Old Neil. I don't feel any guilt when doing something like that...Klein's mind wandered as he watched the stallOwner pick the first silver amulete up. He bought the two silver accessories at five soli six pence and four soli nine pence respectively. He was about to head to another stall when he heard a gentle voice ask him, \"Sir, why are you not buying a completed amulet?\" Klein turned his head over and found a teenage girl asking him the question. She was about fifteen years of age and wore a lacy yellow dress while holding a veiled hat with a ribbon. \"It's because I intend to make my own amulet. As you know, that is the wish of every",
        "111": "Leonard was increasingly convinced that Ince Zangwill's matter was more complicated than he had imagined. The obtaining of a new Card of Blasphemy and the appearance of an abnormality in Mr. World's mental state were the different outcomes of the same matter. Mr. Fool's agreement in convening such a gathering to establish a corresponding organization while hosting it as a deity was definitely not because \"He\" wished to make the area more lively or being done out of goodwill. The evil spirit that Klein pulled into the Underworld probably isn't simple. It's definitely not something that \"being from the Hunter pathway\" would be enough to describe it with... Hmm, Klein's participation in the matter isn't solely for revenge, but is also due to Mr fool's orders... As Leonard sighed, he didn't generate any negative feelings. Instead, he was secretly relieved. Leonard believed that Mr Fool's clear expression of \"His\" goals had made it better than having everything chaotic and unknown. He originally had intense wariness for Pallezast precisely because he wasn't sure of his true motives. He didn't deny or deny the members' word of \"Adam might've established a very secretive organization, secretly steering him\" Emlyn realized that the organization established by Adam is really impressive... Is this the target our Tarot Club is aiming at? He was more concerned about the organization with many important figures participating. He finally confirmed that the early development of the Tarot club could match",
        "112": "Derrick had always believed that the Chief would be able to use the two god-level Sealed Artifacts to complete the Silver Knight's advancement ritual. But he was surprised when Colin Iliad said he needed to seek blessings from external sources. He turned his head to look at Amon in the pointed hat and monocle, and he said, \"Can I pop over to Sefirah Castle to answer a prayer?\" Amon was taken aback as \"He\" asked in amusement, \"Since you want to play such a game, why won't you let it be more exciting?\" In fact, Klein didn't have any hope regarding his request. This was because, as long as he could use the power there to make the first step in escaping from his predicament, this was equivalent to getting Amon to just set him free. \"As the God of Mischief, I've been alive since the Third Epoch. I believe you know what that means. Now, this prophecy has come true, right, Mr. Fool?\" Klein asked. \"I had a premonition that the City of Silver would obtain extremely important information,\" Amon replied. \"This has nothing to do with patience with a dungeon without any sources of entertainment for decades\" Klein thoughtfully changed the topic. \"Was Dark Angel Sasrir really created from your father's rib?\" \"Yes, \u2018He' separated a portion of his characteristics and corresponding negative personalities\"",
        "113": "Bishop Utravsky explained that the imprints of the past are too deep, and they fiercely conflict with your current life, resulting in a split personality. Klein thought for a moment and said in deliberation, \"It's a psychological problem. I think what you need most is a psychiatrist.\" The bishop replied, \"There is a Doctor Sequence among the Beyonder pathway that the Church of Mother Earth controls, which is also known as Healing Pastor in ancient times\" After a set period of time, yes-five minutes-that mystical item will make you completely lose consciousness. After obtaining the item, Klein lit and blew out a few other matchsticks before throwing them at various corners of the cathedral. The surrounding light and shadows were rapidly transforming, and it felt like he was experiencing a real, intense battle. The repentant bishop looked down at him, his facial muscles contorting. Following that, his expression became abnormally ferocious. At the end of the battle, Bishop Utravinsky fell heavily to the ground. His breathless body had blood flowing profusely, and his mouth twitched as he saw the scene before him with a clear mind. He silently evaluated.What a professional performance. But I know that this is a dream within a dream. It's only a dream in the first place. He's extremely skilled in combat.\" Klein pressed his hand to his chest, bowed, and stepped out of the Harvest Church. He found a secluded spot and quickly",
        "114": "Klein was in a hall that had been sealed in history and a forest for thousands of years. The Hidden Sage tried to break through the limitations of the Hidden Sage through the God of Steam and Machinery, in the hall of the Antigonus. Earth Mother, who controlled The Moon's Uniqueness, fended off Primordial Demoness Cheek. A \"light\" that couldn't be seen by most Beyonders landed from high above and crashed into the barrier of nature that used plants as a foundation. It tore through the gaps between the plants, like a torrent, heading straight for Klein, who was about to retrieve the translucent mask. When the hall was sealed by layers of plants, Klein extended his slippery and strange tentacles to grab the mask that represented The Fool's Un uniqueness before it moved towards his face. This showdown entered a stalemate. The God of Craftsmanship didn't properly digest the Sequence 1 Civilization Enlightener potion before advancing to Sequence o due to various reasons. As a true god in a neighboring pathway, The hall that only had corpses hanging in the air suddenly became crowded. Hundreds of figures wore crystal monocles, or had a circular emblem of different colors in the same position. \"They\" open \"Their\" mouths and said words that ordinary people wouldn't be capable of understanding. The Evernight Goddess wasn't able to divert \"Her\" attention. This was because \"She\" was trying her best to suppress the dual-pathway true god,",
        "115": "Klein's heart began beating rapidly. It shrank into a clump before expanding abruptly. He silently and slowly pulled out the revolver and aimed it at the trespasser's head. He had no confidence in striking the intruder. The intruder's deep blue eyes didn't reflect fear, but rather gazed upon Klein with the intensity of a ferocious beast. It seemed that if Klein were careless for a second, the other person would leap forward and tear him to pieces. A leisurely and serene melody entered from outside. The heavy and comfortable voice started to sing.\"Oh, the threat of horror, the hope of crimson cries! One thing at least certain-that-that is certain, and the rest is Lies; the Flower has bloomed forever....\"The poem to possess the power to calm and relax and relax is \"The Flower is forever\" \"You might not believe it, but pulling the trigger would not release a round.\"The empty chamber to prevent misfiring!Following that, Klein listened to the midnight poem as he patiently awaited for the battle outside to end. He held his revolver and took his key. Barefooted, he carefully approached the door before silently opening it to see the black windbreaker and the halved top hat. Dunn Smith was standing there with his deep and calm gray eyes. He said, \"We know very little of the Secret Order. Our success this time is all thanks to your sharp wits. This contribution is all yours\"",

George III's eyes lit up as he saw Demoness Trissy's face and knew that she was about to be attacked by \"His\" power.

It tore open the translucent ice crystal and lacerated Tracy's left arm, causing blood to splatter. \"You can do what you were here for.\"The surface of the paper was quickly dyed with a bright red tinge before it boomeranged back from the trapped Demoness into Klein's palm. \"You can do what you were here for.\"Tracy originally imagined that the piece of paper would come at her throat, but she never expected it to only target her arm. She was momentarily stunned. Only when Gehrman Sparrow folded the piece of paper and placed it into an iron cigar case did she suddenly realize something. She asked, \"Your true target is Katarina?\"Klein placed the iron cigar case back into his pocket without answering her. He calmly asked, \"You are her descendant?\"\"Yes, I am.\"\"Vice Admiral Ailment Tracy's mother, Katarina's current location.\"\"I'm not just a descendant. I'm her child.\" \"The pirates didn't have any doubts about this.",

However, aren't you afraid of being too conspicuous? Aren't you afraid of being caught by the police while you're outside? You're part of the Resistance that engages in secret operations!Klein was about to retract his gaze when he was almost forced to frown by the man's thick, messy eyebrows and cold-blooded eyes.\"I don't know what you're talking about.\"He laughed and added, \"By the definition of you foreigners, they aren't mystical objects, but they all have some supernatural power, but it will slowly, yes-slowly weaken until it disappears.\"Klein looked at his visitor and smiled.\"What mission?\" Klein asked calmly, having no intention of hiding the fact that Danitz was only a follower.Klein looked at his visitor and smiled.He reached into the blanket that extended to his knees and took out a stack of white paper.\"What mission?\" Klein asked calmly.\"Find out where they are. They're all dead.\"Klein looked at his visitor and smiled.\"If you can catch them directly, you will get even more.\"He raised his arms and began to display lifelike portraits, including",
        "186": "It's a pleasure working with you.\"The Hanged Man replied.Wearing the transparent glove, Klein tersely answered before vanishing.He left The Hanged Man behind, and he directly teleported himself to a secluded corner in Bayam City.He then returned to his pocket and, with the help of mirror leap, returned back to the gold coin inside the iron cigar case.The Hanged Man nodded in agreement.The Hanged Man nodded in agreement.Right on the heels of that, Klein's and Alger's bodies turned incorporeal and invisible, leaving the catacombs silent again.The Hanged Man nodded in agreement.The two of them were directly teleported into midair a distance away. Their figures came into existence amidst the shadows of the clouds and the crimson moonlight.The Hanged Man nodded in agreement.Putting away the Tyrant card and the jellyfish-like Beyonder characteristic, Klein glanced at The Hanged Man, indicating that it was his turn to choose.The Hanged Man nodded in agreement.Alger deliberated and said, \"Can I choose the Sequence 4 potion formula from that Card of Blasphemy?\"The Hanged Man nodded in agreement.The Hanged Man nodded in agreement.The exploration he had just completed was the most dangerous adventure he had ever had. If not for the Teleportation from Gehrman Sparrow's Creeping Hunger, he doubted that they could escape alive.The Hanged Man nodded in",

Then, she chanted in ancient Hermes, \u2018The Fool that doesn't belong to this era... I might've met Hvin Rambis...\"Audrey looked at the mirror and smiled. \"Did you notice that Hvin Rambis was there?\"Audrey looked at the mirror. \"Did you notice that Hvin Rambis was there?\"Audrey looked at the mirror. \"Did you notice that Hvin Rambis was there?\"As she spoke, she",

It was the first time that Klarman's body had been touched by the moonlight.It then burst into an intense light, melting away all the undead, darkness, and evil.Klarman's figure burned with a white flame, as though he was a paper figurine that had been brought near red embers.Klarman's body was covered with a white flame.But it really was a paper figurine, one that seemed to be condensed from the crimson moonlight.Klarman's body was covered with a white flame.The Shaman King's substitute spell, Moon Paper Figurine!Klarman's body was covered with a white flame.As the paper figurine turned to ash, the ancient Shaman King appeared at the top of the cathedral and cast his cold gaze at Emlyn White, who was standing near the bell tower.Emlyn White's body was covered with a white flame.At that moment, within Klarman's blood-red eyes, it reflected the figure of Sharron, who was wearing a black regal dress and a tiny bonnet. Her body stiffened as if she had lost control of herself.Emlyn White's body was covered with a white flame.Seeing this, Emlyn didn't hesitate. It was as if he had practiced it a thousand times before. He aimed his Vision of White at the Shaman King's left",

She felt that the little stone pressing against her heart was finally gone.\"What is the cost of the Sequence 0s?\" she asked.Although discussing money and calculating the payment in front of Mr. Fool feels somewhat inappropriate, I can't hide the rewards I received from his adorer...Audrey sighed silently. \"What is the cost of the Sequence 0s?\" she asked.He had an instinctive aversion towards new members.\"What is the cost of the Sequence 0s?\"Klein translated with great difficulty, for he didn't know what the currency unit of the pound corresponded to in the City of Silver, and could only use a Series 9 potion formula as a unit.\"I understand.\" Derrick slightly nodded, and then quietly added, \"... Thank you.\"The World maintained his silent and staid temperament and didn't comment on what had just happened. He turned to Justice and The Hanged Man, waiting for their response.Audrey thought for a few seconds and said, \"Potion formula for Psychiatrist and their corresponding Beyonder ingredients. Uh... That's Sequence 7 of the Spectator pathway. Is that correct?\"\"You can gather the information first, and there's no rush to purchase them.

But Kenley's death left my mind in chaos. At that moment, all I could think of was a clumsy excuse, thus, giving you the opportunity to witness what I was doing.\"\"What secret is that?\" Klein pressed, now being more at ease.\"What secret is that?\" Klein asked.\"What secret is that?\"Dunn placed his hand into his pocket, intending to take out his pipe, only to find that he had left it in his office.\"What secret is that?\"Dunn weighed his words and said, \"There might be a law in mysticism. Heh, even though I haven't read many books, I'm still aware of what a law means. What secret is that?\"Dunn knitted his eyebrows and asked, unusually stern, \"Are you sure that the situation has worsened to such an extent?\"Dunn nodded solemnly.\"Yes. In no more than three minutes, Megose will undergo a mutation, and her child will descend upon us,\" Leonard said with a certain tone.\"What secret is that?\"Dunn asked.Klein's eyes opened wide. He suddenly came to a realization and asked thoughtfully, \"For example, the Sealed Artifacts, mysterious objects, or a potion",

It looked like it was written in Loenese.Hehe, you think I'm the kind of adventurer or archaeologist who ends up killing himself because of curiosity?Danitz thought with both caution and pride.Hehe, hehe, you think I'm the kind of adventurer or archaeologist who ends up killing himself because of curiosity?It took a few seconds for the radio transceiver to produce its clickety-clack again.

Who told you that?Danitz's face instantly reddened. He looked at the radio transceiver.He felt at a loss to have the secret that had been buried deep in his heart for so many years revealed so suddenly. He was embarrassed and ashamed at the same time and subconsciously wanted to deny it.But at the same time, he was also shocked and confused as to how this matter had been discovered by an outsider. He had never told anyone, and he had kept this secret very well hidden!Hehe, hehe, he",

These plagued him to the point that he couldn't even sleep in peace.\"No problem,\" the gloomy World indifferently said.Klein really wasn't in a hurry. He hadn't finished concluding his Faceless principles, and his digestion of the potion had only just begun. It would still take several months.Klein didn't know what to do next.Therefore, his plan wasn't to head straight for the Gargas Archipelago. Instead, he would act as an adventurer and a traveler as he worked his way through the colonial islands. From time to time, he would change his identity and experience life in order to extract the Faceless principles.During this process, he would inquire more about mermaids in detail. After knowing that the Church of the Goddess reared such spiritual creatures and that they possessed High-Sequence potion formulas of the Seer pathway, Klein kept feeling worried about traps placed against every Faceless in the Gargas Archipelago who sought advancement.Klein didn't know what to do next.Audrey said, honestly, \"I got some information from the Psychology Alchemists.

Therefore, for his visit to Red Rose Manor, he abided by the rules of a Magician. He had made some preparations beforehand, such as separating his matches and carrying a number of his mystical items on him.Among the mystical items, the Biological Poison Bottle and the Sun Brooch were involved in the Capim and Wraith incidents; therefore, out of caution, he left them above the gray fog, As for the All-Black Eye which was left behind by Nimblewright Master Rosago, it was difficult to get past the manor guards; hence, it was met with the same treatment.As for the other mystical items, they were left behind by Nimblewright Master Rosago.Finally, other than the three kinds of bullets\u2060-purifying bullets, demon-hunting bullets, and exorcism bullets of purification-he only brought along two mystical items.The first was the Master Key that allowed him to pass through obstacles. The side effects of getting lost could be offset by dowsing. Furthermore, it looked like an ordinary key so it wasn't easily discovered.

In fact, it only looked slightly more normal than Elizabeth's behavior and, later, Selena's.Klein chuckled as he had long thought of an excuse and said, \"There was a mistake in one of the document descriptions, and I already informed my colleagues that I would hand it over to them when I arrive early at the company tomorrow morning. So, I can either amend it now since it's on the way or wake up at least half an hour earlier tomorrow morning. No doubt, I've chosen to do the former.\"Dunn smirked and explained with his soothing voice, \"At around seven tonight, the police station referred us to a case. From our initial assessments, there doesn't seem to be any danger or urgency, so it was decided that you would complete it on your own tomorrow.\"Dunn smirked again and said, \"Alright, we shall wait for you.\" Klein looked away and smoothed out the ruffles of her hair.Dunn smirked again and said, \"I don't know what happened, but I'm sure it was a mistake.\"Dunn smirked again and said, \"I'm sure it was a mistake.\"Dunn smirked again and said, \"Leonard and I went to look for Hanass Vincent last night",

He then turned to look down at the ground.Klein took a glance and discovered at least six stone statues of both sexes. They were entirely grayish-white in color, and even their clothes looked like they were engraved. They were all dressed in black and white.These stone statues included elves, giants, and humans that had an ancient dress sense. Apart from their frozen expressions of pain and despair, there wasn't anything similar. They were all dressed in black and white.Klein felt a chill down his back when he saw their eyeballs watching him without moving, having made the connection that they were once alive. He felt that darkness ruled the depths of this passageway, as though a terrifying monster had widened its mouth as it lay in wait for the two to walk into its belly.Klein and Alger looked at each other.Reining in their stirring emotions, Klein and Alger remained silent as they passed through the grayish-white statues with warped expression, and they proceeded forward.Klein and Alger looked at each other.After walking for more than ten seconds, Klein didn't need to use Senor's night vision to see the damaged and dark murals thanks to the lantern.The murals on both sides remained damaged, and they were still describing the greatness and holiness of the ancient sun god.Klein and Alger looked at each other",

He was wearing a black suit and a halved top hat of the same color. He had a cane adorned with silver in his hand and a pair of gold-framed spectacles on his face. He had a refined bearing.Klein looked over at the stall owner.\"Yes, do you need it? This can here costs three soli.\" The owner of the stall was wearing a long black robe, one filled mysticism traits.Klein looked over at the stall owner.The inquirer whose sideburns were pale yellow thought for a moment before saying, \"Can it be cheaper? I still need to buy other ingredients too. For example, this bottle of white-edged sunflower petals.\"Klein looked at the stall owner as he spoke and noticed that the man had a weird look in his eyes, as if deciding if he had to give a cut of the profit to Klein.Klein looked at the stall owner.\"It's because I intend to make my own amulets. As you know, that is the wish of every aficionado of mysticism,\" Klein minced his words and answered.He did not wish to make the stall owner think that he was trying to snatch his business, even though he had considered using his \"skill",

Likewise for 0-08. Therefore, \"any mention of it will be known\" was a Beyonder power of this pathway at higher Sequences. Likewise for \"the more you know of it, the more it knows of you\"!If this was the case, it would be the case.Impressive... But won't this be rather noisy... Audrey momentarily looked forward to it with envy while also feeling worried and puzzled.She sighed.\"Any mention of it will be known\"... So the organization behind the assassination of Duke Negan, the one backer behind Qilangos was established by King of Angels Adam... Alger was first somewhat enlightened before his expression fell.He began to suspect that the primitive island that he had previously explored was related to this secret organization. This was because Qilangos had once ventured deep into it and discovered several items. Furthermore, the final disappearance of the island had resembled the powers of the Dragon of Imagination as described by The Sun.",

He looked at the skeletons and said, \"A common point between them was them being greatly deformed.

They were all very deformed.\"\"This was originally a city that believed in the Phoenix. Later, it converted its target of faith to my father, but it retained some customs related to death.\" The monocled Amon, casually sized up his surroundings and said, \"After the Cataclysm, they were left behind in the Forsaken Land of the Gods.
