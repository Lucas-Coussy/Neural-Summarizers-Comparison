One of them raised his head and roared, causing brown short hair to tear through his clothes. In an instant, he transformed into a terrifying giant bear that was twice the height of a person. At the same time, Reinette Tinekerr left the gold coin in Klein's pocket and floated towards the eight-legged demonic wolf. \"She\" kept moving at high speeds, waving \"Her\" sharp claws as \"She's\" engaged in an intense battle with the hill-like Dark Demonic Wolf. \"He\" had successfully hidden underground to avoid the lightning bombardment. The independent \"kingdom\" created by the \"curtain\" had completely disintegrated. However, the Dark demonic Wolf's wish hadn't completely expired. The return of godhood still needed some time. \"Him\" could no longer swap locations with his marionette. He was about to all together collide with the huge brown bear. He jumped up and kicked the brown bear and flew past the diagonally crossed. He then swung his black staff down and ruthlessly struck the bear's shoulder. The brown bear didn't back down. It spread open its arms, trying to give him a \"passionate\" hug that could crush all his bones and squeeze his chest muscles. Klein didn't retreat-he didn't want to hurt the thick of the hide of the bear. With the Staff of the Stars, the physical attack would lead to random abnormal changes or strange effects. Under the God of Wishes's suppression, these changes and effects wouldn't exceed that of a Sequence 4 Beyonder power. After Sefirah Castle's anomaly, time became abnormally precious. No one was willing to stall for time, because it wouldn't be long before high-level existences like the True Creator and Angel of Time Amon in the Forsaken Land of the Gods descended. The Dark Demonic Wolf Kotar trembled violently and flung out the translucent velvet curtain. The curtain first vanished into thin air before it suddenly appeared behind Klein. Just as his spirituality was about to send a warning, it covered him and wrapped him within it! The curtain then disappeared. The staff lit up and the gems embedded in it lit up. A pure white and holy pillar of light descended from the sky, enveloping the black gas and the corresponding marionette. The poison quickly melted under the Sun's burning. It was the same with the marionettes of the Dark demonic Wolf. Klein had finished off the remainingMarionettes in just a few seconds. He then turned around and aimed his staff at the brown bear that was split into two. The brown bear's internal organs and blood gushed to the ground in a rather shocking scene. Its two halves were squirming as it struggled to stabilize his center of mass and continued attacking. Its body finally collapsed, unable to get Reinette Tinekerr immediately \"jumped\" and appeared on the translucent \"curtain,\" purging it from Klein's body and teleporting elsewhere. The Dark Demonic Wolf seized the opportunity and raised \"His\" neck, letting out a roar. \"He\" launched repeated attacks on Klein, forcing Reinette to block them. More and more wounds appeared, making it look like \"She\" could not last any longer. At this critical moment, as Klein controlled the Spirit Body Threads to resist the attraction of the \"cloak,\" he reached into his pocket and took out another iron cigar case. Inside, there was a gold coin lying quietly. There was also a Wraith on the surface of the gold coin. On it were nearly illusory black tubes that extended into infinity, connecting to the unknown. This was the symbol of Artificial Death. It was the reenactment of the time when the Evernight Goddess had used God of Glory Bladel's corpse to foil Amon's attempt to snatch Sefirah Castle. For this, he deliberately found a wraith-like monster in the Forsaken Land of the Gods and imprisoned it, placing it together with the Artificial Death project's white feathers he summoned from the fog of history. He was afraid that he wouldn't be able to obtain the desired effect. Only when the \"Curtain\" targeted him and Miss Messenger did he feel that the opportunity was here. He followed the method that he learned from Zar","1":"Klein's head recovered instantly, and the charred maggots that had drilled out had turned transparent again before crawling back inside. The divine blood \"He\" dripped before \"His\" death fused with the silver crucifix, and it later turned into the latter's form, becoming a rather powerful Sealed Artifact. The Unshadowed Crucifix was obtained by one of the three Kings of Angels, or it landed in Amon's or Adam's hands. To \"Them,\" this is an important item \"Their\" father left behind. It doesn't belong to Elvish, Dragonese, and ancient Hermes... Yes, it has similarities with the ancient Feysac of the Northern Continent and the Dutanese of the Southern Continent. It's similar to Jotun, but it's also different. The cross's effects are extremely useful. Furthermore, its origins are a secret that needs to be kept. No one would give it to the Augustus family... From the looks of it, was it really arranged by Adam? It's a very reasonable manner to give the cross to Miss Magician and Miss Judgment. But the level of \"He's\" plan on raising that question and obtaining an answer is extremely high. That City of Silver Creator's level is \"He was able to sense my history despite the long stretch of history between us\" He cast his gaze above the gray fog and cast it on this mysterious space. He created a special shadow, creating a special Klein wrote down the knowledge he had learned from looking straight at the City of Silver Creator. He then threw Unshadowed Crucifix into the junk pile and stirred the powers of the mysterious space above the gray fog to suppress it. He didn't wish to see the paper figurines he cut begin to praise the Sun the next time he came. Audrey knew that Hvin Rambis was actually a member of the upper echelons of a secret organization known as the Psychology Alchemists, but she didn't understand how this was suddenly exposed. Hvin has been identified as a cultist and is wanted by all three Churches. He disappeared before the warrant was issued. Audrey was about to solemnly pray to the Goddess when a gray fog appeared before a blurry figure that sat on the middle of the grayish-white fog, that appeared that doesn't belong to the Evernight Goddess. It nearly lurked here, hidden, but then it appeared in front of an ordinary house in Cherwood Borough. It was a postman riding a bike braked and stopped at the door. After a while, a pitch-black flame suddenly spewed out of the mailbox's mouth. The postman briskly walked to the mailbox and threw the letter in. Following that, he didn't delay as he got on his bike and kicked off. The flame burned quietly and quickly disappeared. Audrey asked with concern, \"Father, did something happen?\" The Church of Evernight has obtained intelligence from Qonas Kilgor and confirmed that King George III hides an extremely huge secret. For the obtaining of a Blood Emperor ruins in the Sterlewen segment of the Tussock River, he colluded with the Demoness Sect and Psychology Alchemists to partake in human trafficking. Audrey's eyes widened as upheavals went through her heart. She felt an inexplicable sense of anger and sadness. It felt like particular principles she had upheld in the past had been ruthlessly trampled, or that values that had stood up to time were silently crumbling. The three Churches likely don't have any actual evidence; otherwise, Father wouldn't only be frustrated to this degree... Audrey sat in the tranquil darkness and didn't move for a long time. Then, she exhaled and whispered, \"Thank you, Mr. Fool. Please convey my gratitude to Mr. World.\" After her prayer, Audrey sat on her bed and didn's move for another long time, until she was finally able to get up and walk out of the room. \"I'm aware,\" she said. \"Please remind Miss Justice to be careful when she meets Hvin Rambis again. She needs to be constantly prepared to seek help.\" \"I am aware,\" he replied. \"Miss Justice, I'm aware.\" \"Please tell Miss Justice that I am aware of her need for help,\" he said, \"and that I will help her get it.\"","2":"The smell of canned wolf-fish is really pungent... Not only is it smelly, but it's also disgusting... It's practically a biological weapon!Klein crouched in the corner and took nearly a minute to recover. He had failed to take the necessary actions to deal with the situation. He could've used Paper Figurine Substitutes or create an invisible air tube to pretend that he was using Underwater Breathing, but he had done none of that. In Nas and the Gargas Archipelago, the culinary methods for preparing beluga whale had transformed into a unique culture. There were all sorts of techniques and famous restaurants. He passed by the various whaling houses, seeing separated fat being carried out on cargo carriages towards nearby factories that spewed black smoke. They were oil refineries which were very unique to Gargas. He turned his head upon hearing the din and saw the tall populace with slightly blonde hair raising horizontal banners as they protested on the streets. He realized that many passersby were completely unfazed. Apart from a small bunch of spectators, the rest continued proceeding to their destinations. Do protests develop into riots? As expected of the Feysac Empire...Klein mumbled to himself, circled the street, and casually found an inn to stay. He continued registering Gehrman as a cause as a Church of the Goddess of Faceless. This because he had no plans on traveling through the fishing routes to find mermaids Klein was originally worried that he would encounter many Faceless here, meeting seven or eight Faceless simply from going next door to enjoy some whale cuisine. However, after serious consideration, he rationally eliminated this possibility. Beyonders from the Seer pathway were rare to begin with. Klein had only met three Beyonders who were beyond Sequence 8, and second, Sequence 6 Beyonders weren't commonly seen. Even in a playground for pirates, those who had 5,000-pound bounties were considered rare creatures. Once a Faceless had many preparations, they would seek out mermaids on a whaling boat. They would either begin having faith in the Goddess, sink to the bottom of the ocean, or become research personnel. It was very rare for them to stay on Gargas Archipelago for long. The harmonica that had fixed the summoning ritual of a spirit world creature, it matched Klein's inward intentions completely. It could be used for a year and a half. Klein didn't blame the Artisan for making changes without his permission. He went to Gray Amber Street the next morning and entered a sundry store named Hot Whale Dance. He discovered that the street lamps were sparse, but the lights from the houses lining the streets were bright. To a certain extent, they reduced the darkness of the night. He found that the light-colored patterns had a strange beauty. He had imagined such a scene-a crazy and powerful adventurer playing a sad tune on The Hermit Cattleya could clearly see The World. He had black hair and brown eyes, with a thin and angular face. The World was actually the crazy hunter, Gehrman Sparrow, who was considered at the level of a pirate admiral! The World had previously only relied on her eyes and other details to suspect that she was Admiral of Stars, but she wasn't certain. She had jumped in fright when The World, who had chosen to speak privately with her, immediately greeted her with \"Admiral of Stars\" It was partly because of this that she chose to take on The World's commission. She discovered that the true strength and standards of the Tarot Club members were far stronger than she had expected. Her eyes were deep black with a slight purple hue which was filled with mystery. The Hermit's eyes were very special, and he said, \"Can I understand that as a form of praise?\" She smiled, feeling somewhat enlightened, and asked, \"When can we set off?\" He didn't respond as he switched to asking, 'When can I go to Loen?' He was taken to a warehouse at the back of the warehouse. The boss asked, 'Who introduced you here?' \"Ma'am Gehrmuses,\" Klein said a name in the style of the local customs. \"Let me search for it. Let's see...\" the boss mumbled as he crouched. The room gradually turned dark as all the corners","3":"After hearing Macht's reply, and combining what he knew, Klein guessed that the rat in the manor was likely the Marauder demigod which had been by Hazel's side. As for why it went rabid and bit Hazel, he was unsure. He nodded slightly and tapped his chest four times in a clockwise fashion. \"May the Goddess bless her.\"After saying that, he walked past the host, entered the hall, and waited for the ball tonight to begin. The scene from before surfaces in the girl's mind as her blurry dream-like state gradually turned clear. She saw gray rats crawling out from the corner of her bedroom, balcony, and bed. All of them had dark red eyes but could only produce squeaking sounds. The more she looked, the more terrified she became. She had no idea what she would discover next, nor did she understand what the person was who created the dream to begin with. The only thing she was certain of was that the other party's level and strength in the supernatural domain far exceeded hers! This shattered what little pride she had left after she had been thrown into an illusion for nearly ten seconds. It was as though it wasn't her hand that was bitten but her heart. She was in a similar state, her entire being turbid and muddled. Her left hand was wrapped in thick bandages, but there weren't any more signs of blood. Her expression was heavy, nothing like her usual arrogance. Hazel was afraid to head to the manor and inform her teacher, but she was afraid of encountering danger and end up being sacrificed. Her teacher had seemingly lost the ability to communicate. To go from North Borough's B\u00f6klund Street to Macht's manor in Backlund's northwestern suburbs would take three to five hours on carriage. Klein had used Tinder before and had some idea about the powers of the Marauder pathway. He suspected that Hazel, who had an item of a higher level, could \"steal\" the flight abilities of birds and use that short period of time to cross the river. This way, she might arrive within three hours.Regardless, I'll be faster than her... Klein retracted his gaze and began considering who his next dance partner should be. \"I'm a little tired. I plan on sleeping now. Don't let anyone disturb me,\" Hazel said to her lady's maid outside. \"Yes, my lady,\" the maid immediately replied. \"You're not a likable girl, she has quite a kind heart... Klein nodded indiscernibly and praised her inwardly. He had already noticed Hazel's actions thanks to his intuition. He wasn't worried about her actions, because to go from B\u00f6Klund Street. to Machsmanor in the northwestern suburbs of Backlund. It was inevitable to spend five hours traveling. At night, there were only three bridges to consider, and they were all under the Tussock Red-eyed rats ran out from the roof beams, storage cabinets, and all kinds of miscellaneous. Klein could control as many as 50 marionettes, a number that would rise once he finished digesting the potion. The rats reflected into his eyes as Klein pulled the human-skinned glove on his left hand, casting his gaze towards the flowerbed in the manor. He was none other than Gehrman Sparrow, the Bizarro Sorcerer's marionette. He left the ball ahead of time, returned to Dwayne Dant\u00e8s's residence and entered his bedroom. Then, he teleported over with Winner Enuni and the latter had been left outside theManor to allow for any instantaneous switches in positions. The result was that the two men were able to take control of a large number of rats at once. They had to fight their way through the rats to get to the other side of the house, which was guarded by a large group of maids. They were eventually able to defeat the rats, but they had to wait until the next day to find out what had happened to the man who had won the ball the night before. The man was later revealed to be a former member of the Royal Family, who had died in a car crash in the early hours of the morning. He had been killed by a rat that had been bitten by Miss Hazel, one of the maids who had been at the ball.","4":"Duke Negan's heart began to beat violently in an unbearable manner, like a steam boiler whose pressure had gone beyond its limits. His body expanded and grew a pair of huge bat wings that emitted light blue tongues of flames. The Wind-blessed and the duke's secretary, who were onguard on both sides of the room, simultaneously sensed the strange and mysterious smell of spirituality. The former's body was suddenly surrounded by a violent wind, sweeping him towards the wall, and with a clang, a large hole was blown through the wall. The secretary went straight to the source of the mystery-the attic of the house! Along the way, he didn't evade or dodge, but the decorative vases and other objects in the corridor seemed to have found lives of their own and avoided him in ingenious ways. The entire attic was a mess, with traces of destruction and char everywhere, and the house even shook a few times. But the mysterious power that was \"sealed\" in here, had yet to be destroyed. The Desire Apostle wasn't frustrated by the failure of his previous attempt, nor was he flustered by the fact that he couldn't control his desires. He spat out a word in the Devil, filled with foulness and filth, and said: \"Die at the same time! Die at the very same time!\" The room suddenly felt like it had been completely sealed, as if one could never leave the room unless effort was Duke Negan had suffered an assassination attempt from Pirate Admiral Qilangos the last time, and now, it was an unknown Sequence 5 expert. Duke Negan was angry and resentful and wanted to find the mastermind and use all the resources at his disposal to tear the mastermind apart. He opened his left fist and aimed at the Desire Apostle with the palm of his hand. His figure split into two. One was refined and skinny like his actual self, the other was a shadow covered by a black liquid of \"desire\" The two quickly alternated, overlapping with each other at times. The words said in the Language of Foulness echoed in the attic as the secretary let out a low grunt and took two steps back. The split silhouette dissipated, and large swaths of rusted red marks appeared on his face, as though he had turned into a man of iron that had been left in a humid area for years. His body felt empty and his mind was sluggish. He was completely unable to use his Beyonder powers. He motioned to the Wind-blessed to remove the conch necklace from his neck and brought the item to his lips. He wanted to meet up with the duke's guards outside; there were two or three Low-Sequence Beyonders among them. However, he wasn't sure if there were any other enemies, and he was afraid of being ambushed en route. Duke Negan was killed by the Wind-blessed. He was the leader of the Conservative Party, the noble with the largest land apart from the king, the elder brother of the current Prime Minister, and a truly important figure. Duke Negan's body twitched a few times, but then it stopped moving. The roses in the nearby glass greenhouse were still in full bloom. The Desire Apostle quickly left the villa, evacuating from the scene based on a predetermined route. The figure that was covered by the black liquid and the suitcase in the corner had disappeared. However, there weren't any signs of the thin fog being scattered in the direction of the Holy Wind Cathedral. It was at this moment that a sea of blood seemed to appear before his eyes. He heard the sound of something shattering and felt a warm sensation at the back of his head. He rolled to the ground and a formless wind as sharp as knives appeared out of thin air, slicing through the throats of the guards. He then turned into countless black shadows, jumping up and down on the ground. The blond secretary's eyes reddened. He raised his right arm, and slightly curled the corners of his mouth. His heart suddenly skipped a beat. He clenched his fist and said, \"No!\" All of a sudden, the Desire Apostle liquefied and turned into numerous black shadows. He rematerialized in another direction, and then, he looked at the enemy, raising his right","5":"Emlyn White, a Sequence 6 Beyonder, was told by his Ancestor that the apocalypse is approaching and that we need to make preparations. Emlyn's mission was to pray to The Fool. Mr. Door had also mentioned that the \"The Moon\" card is empty, indicating that, on the one hand, the Primordial Moon is most likely the embodiment of some other deity or powerful devil. On the other hand, it indirectly proves that the ancient goddess Lilith has lost her Sequence 0 position, which  is generally equivalent to dying. The greatest suspect is the Goddess who had snatched  the title of Lady of Crimson, but \"She's\" already Sequence 0, corresponding to \"The Star\" in the Cards of Blasphemy. The Fool plays a key role in \"Her\" revelation. If that's true, then in a certain way,  it's an invitation for \"cooperation\"... But how am I to cooperate with a yet-to-disappear ancient goddess? Let Emlyn White join the Tarot Club? The Sanguine are a race with  a long lifespan. They have existed since the Second Epoch and must know quite a number of secrets. Yes, it would be possible to divine whether or not to pull Emlyn into each gathering ahead of time... Yes, there was a similar apocalyptic prophecy in the Sights in  the Spirit World from Yellow Light Venithan. \"He\" also pointed out that the Abraham family's curse Emlyn White was pulled into a magical place by a hidden existence. Klein saw the stars behind Emlyn's chair shift quickly, turning into the symbol of the crimson moon. The Beyonder pathway of the descendants of the ancient goddess, Lilith, points towards the \"Moon\" The key to the apocalypse isn't you, but me! The Fool is not angry... Is it because I represent the Ancestor? I, Emlyn White, am indeed special. Emlyn bowed and said, \"That is what I wish for!\" \"But you have to adhere to certain matters,\" Klein said. \"This is a secret, which is why I responded after you were free from surveillance from you\" \"This includes the Sanguine who were previously present at the ritual.\" \"But...\" Emlyn was somewhat unable to accept the request. \"It's likely that that Lilith's likely to report to you that you didn't get anyone afterward?\" Klein asked warmly in a very certain manner, \"It could be inferred from the fact that there was no prayer content in the revelation!\" \"Her name sounds like they're old friends...Emlyn's trembled\" He lowered his head and replied, \"No.\"Klein said with an unperturbed smile, \"This  is a deal, which  I responded to after you responded to the revelation\" \"I don't know,\" Emlyn said in a slightly dazed manner. \"Why would your Ancestor think that I would Emlyn White was overjoyed. He said in a hurry, \"Honorable Mr. Fool, I would  like you to help me dispel the psychological cue in me. A bishop of the  Church of Earth Mother...\" Klein calmly interrupted him. \"I can help you, but what price are you willing to pay for this?\" Emlyn thought about it for a moment, but he couldn't think of anything that would interest a secret existence like The Fool. He chose \"The Moon\" as a code name. The Dark Emperor card and the purification of the Sun Brooch would thoroughly disperse Emlyn White's psychological cue. Emlyn's will will pass through the earth. He will be the key to saving the Sanguine. The Moon is the only card that can dispel the cue in Emlyn. The card is the Dark Emperor, the card that is used in the Book of Secrets. It is the most powerful card in the Major Arcana. The Sun is the least powerful card. It can be used to dispel EmlynWhite's cue, but only if it is paired with the Moon card, which is the lowest card. The moon is the highest card in  the MajorArcana. It has the highest level of power in the major Arcana, the highest being the Sun. It also has the lowest level of psychological cue, the lowest being the Moon. The dark card is also the most common card in all of the MajorArana.","6":"Klein drank the Classical Metallurgist potion formula. Then, he asked Arrodes about Sefirah Castle. He then used Paper Angel to seal a ceramic jar with the Beyonder's blood. After that, the full-body mirror with cracks suddenly rippled with aqueous light and silver words quickly appeared: \"Exalted Great Master, your devoted, loyal and humble servant, Arrode, is here to answer your summoning\" After answering, he silently added in his heart: \"I'm just comforting you... After I complete the ritual, I'll personally pay Miss Sharron a visit\" After a few seconds, the pale golden words faded away, becoming silver once again. On the surface of the mirror, lines of words appeared again: \"Eight\" There are there are eight detailed records on the second Blasphemy Slate. There are no details on the first, but the second is more detailed. Unfortunately, I haven't seen it yet. I'm just short of Prisoner, Devil, and Demoness... Heh, are her magic tricks just for show? Thankfully, my potion has already digested, so there's no need for me to push her anymore... Klein mumbled inwardly as he threw the ceramic jar covered in paper figurine back into the junk pile. He didn't immediately prepare to advance to Scholar of Yore. Instead, he took out a pen and paper and drew the symbol that was a mixture of conceal There are rumors that deep in the spirit world city, Calder\u00f3n City, there are clues to the River of Eternal Darkness. As for the others, I've heard of some names, but it's not a complete list. There's Tenebrous World, Knowledge Moor, as well as the Brood Hive that's related to the moon\" Klein silently repeated the key information in Arrodes's response. He had a nagging feeling that he should be able to grasp something, but he didn't gain much from it. He even lacked the ability to piece together the clues. \"From the looks of it, you might come from the Chaos Sea,\" he said with a smile. \"That's not important. What's important is that I'm your loyal, lowly, and obedient servant.\" \"What are the origins of Dark Angel Sasrir?\" Klein asked. \"There was a myth that said that, when the ancient sun god was born, \u2018He' was light and darkness combined. Back then, it was theAncient sun god who personally fabricated and spread this myth... Amon's brother, your wife has become the Dark Angel!\" Klein was first alarmed before many strange ideas arose in his mind. \"The World is a fake person. He doesn't have his own spirituality and thoughts...Thankfully, The World is not a person\" \"Dark Angel\" was ultimately the deputy of the divine kingdom, god's left hand. So this implies that this was very likely I cannot eliminate the possibility that the Hidden Sage, Primordial Moon, and the Dark Side of the Universe are the Dark Angel's \"alt\"... Yes, there might still be the Mother Tree of Desire hidden within... It's also possible with Prisoner. There's no clear evidence that this pathway has produced a true deity. Back then, the Chained God might not even be a King of Angels. After some thought, he said to Arrodes, \"It's your turn to ask.\" On the cracked full-body mirror's surface, silver words twisted together and formed a new sentence: \"Great Master, may I guess what you want to ask next?\" Klein nodded slightly and answered, \"Sure.\" \"You wish to ask about Sasrir's current state. My answer is, I don't know, as I can't see.\" Behind the silver words was a smiley face with a simple drawing. On the surface of the mirror, the simple smile on his face turned into a waving cat's paw. \"That's all for today. I will summon you again in the near future at any time,\" Klein praised. \"Yes, Great Master. Your loyal servant, Arrode, is constantly preparing to serve you!\" He then \"Teleported\" to the Southern Continent. He didn't dare to advance in Backlund. If anything were to happen to him, Amon and Zaratul would definitely be able to detect it and come straight for him!","7":"Audrey's personal maidservant, Annie, was monitoring the servants while they did their work. Audrey asked Susie, \"Susie, you'll receive a gift in a while. Are you looking forward to it?\" The golden retriever barked and wagged her tail to express her joy and anticipation. Susie could read the joy and sincere attitude deep inside Audrey's heart as she subconsciously opened her mouth, hoping to stir the air to produce a voice. The alert Suzie abandoned her original thoughts. She returned to the state of being an ordinary dog as she slowly wagging her tail. Audrey was taken aback before a brief silence ensued. Audrey had already finished digesting the Psychiatrist potion on Wednesday. She could easily pay off the 2,000 pounds she owed Mr. Fool's Blessed, and she could also pay the 1,800 pounds she owes Mr. World for the Psychiatist characteristic. The psychiatrist characteristic is a type of magic that can only be found in the realm of mysticism and ritualistic magic. The Psychiatrist characteristic is also known as the \"Psycho\" characteristic and is used by some of the world's most famous healers. The name Psycho is also used to refer to the type of medicine that is used to treat schizophrenia and other mental illnesses. It is also the name of a type that can be used to cure people of depression and bipolar disorder, as well as other mental disorders. Daisy's mother and sister had hired a private detective to search for her after she was abducted. The detective had grown a thick beard and wore gold-rimmed glasses. He was almost identical to the one in her memories. Daisy woke up from her depression and sorrow. The person who had entered Daisy's dream was none other than Leonard Mitchell. He recalled what he had seen in the dream as he wore his red glove and entered the basement of Saint Samuel Cathedral. Leonard smiled as he received the dossier. He stood there without being in a hurry to sit down as he casually browsed it. A vampire. Currently under the jurisdiction of the Church of Earth... His parents had hired private detectives to find him. Thanks to a particular detective, this matter was ultimately resolved by the famous detective, Sherlock Moriarty. Leonard's smile gradually froze as his expression turned serious. He repeated this name in his mind...Sherlock Moriarty...Klein wasn't a rush in a rush to find a true acting opportunity to engage in an opportunity to act in a way that would help the people of the Harvest Church. The Nighthawk shrugged and said, \"No, as long as you stop making me have nightmares.\" He then left the building and went back to his office. The team captain, Soest, saw a partner approach and hand him two thin sheets of paper. The information regarding the red-eyed man from the Harvest church is all here. He toured Oravi Island's port city with the mindset of a tourist, finding a brief and rare moment of relaxation in his tense life. The city had mostly immigrants from Loen. The cuisine wasn't much different from the east coast of the kingdom, with the only difference being that there were rare fruits and all sorts of seafood here. After chewing a juicy and sweet fruit, Klein watched the sky turn dark. He took a turn at the corner of the street and entered a bar named Sweet Lemon. Klein planned on buying the two remaining supplementary ingredients of a Nimblewright Master-the relatively common drago tree bark and Sonia Golden Spring water. A green-eyed man in his thirties held half a glass of liquor and spoke to two men and two women in the corner. It was a mystery if they were merchants or adventurers. The man cut off the man's words by saying, \"You are also named Gehrman Sparrow? Treasure map Why does it sound like a scam... My killing of Wormtongue has already reached this place from Bayam? Yes, it was likely communicated via a telegram or visitors. Therefore, many people know of my name and deeds but do not know what I look like... Cheats are using this opportunity to pass themselves off as me to cheat others...Klein moved over as he came to a realization. He pulled the trigger without any hesitation. He saw a spark light up at the ground near his crotch.","8":"Sharron was silent for two seconds before she said, \"I'll help ask\" Klein vaguely grasped Sharron's intentions as he stuffed the silver necklace back into his collar. He asked after some thought, \"Which power of a High-Sequence Prisoner pathway Beyonder makes all surrounding lifeless items attack one's target?\" Sharron succinctly replied, \"Puppet\" Klein nodded in enlightenment and asked, \"Then, do you know that demigod?\" He immediately described in detail the appearance of the elder who had attacked him outside Bayam. \"Shanks,\" Sharron calmly said a name. \"He is an Abomination born 922 years ago and claims to be the son of the Chained God' The Rose School of Thought sent its leader to deal with me, \" Sharron said without hiding anything or any emotions, like a doll. \"I got on the bad side with the Mother Tree of Desire, and I suffered an ambush from the Rose School. Thankfully, I was in Bayam, allowing the Church of Storms and the kingdom's military to take action. I also threw out an item corrupted with the True Creator's aura, as well as something related to the Numinous Episcopate. In short, it was chaos,. and I took the opportunity to escape.\" He replied frankly, apart from hiding the existence of Miss Messenger and Mr. Azik, he believed that Miss Sharron had long known that he wasn't affected by Klein felt a chill run down his back again as he asked, \"Is Abomination the name of the Prisoner pathway's Sequence 2 or Sequence 1?\" Sharron didn't give an affirmative answer, but said, \"Williams Street has been destroyed\" by the Nighthawks and Machinery Hivemind. \"Baronet Pound died during one of his revelries,\" Sharron said. \"That's it? That's the end to Alista Tudor's final bloodline?\" Klein thought and said, 'How's the situation with Williams Street at the moment?' Sharron described without much of an expression, \"Some high-rise buildings are being built\" \"Shall we go now?\" Klein probed, \"Have you gone down to explore it?\"Sharron succinctly expressed her stance. \"Alright.\" She didn't ask how Sherlock Moriarty was planning on heading down with her. \"He will head down in my stead,\" Klein said with a smile. \"Good evening. I'm honored to work with you.\" Sharron swept her gaze across Klein and Senor, and without a word her body sank into the soil. \"Admiral of Blood Senor quite detest......Klein curled his lips and made his marionette turn into a Wraith. He leaned on a tree, half-closed his eyes as he seriously controlled the tree, and he seriously closed his eyes on the Wraith. \"I'm just a mere Sequence 5!\" Klein's vision and Senor's vision overlapped with one another as he saw black-brown soil, squirming worms, and miscellaneous items in between the rocks. As they passed through layers of obstacles, they arrived at the region where the ruin once was. The dome ceiling had collapsed and the stone columns had snapped. Between the rubble and soil, there were only a few signs of crushed bone and rotting clothes. The dark gold and deep blue light from before had all vanished. The Beyonder characteristics have been taken away by the Nighthawks and Machinery Hivemind...Senor's expression twitched as it perfectly reflected Klein's mood. The evil spirit wasn't completely obliterated? It had long escaped? Klein thought about it when he suddenly came to an alarming conclusion. If a living person had entered and exited this room over the past half year, a Wraith should be able to sense it. Besides, the deity statues obviously cannot be seen by the nighthawks or the Machinery hivemind. The room where the evil spirit was sealed had likewise been destroyed and buried. Klein used Senor\u2019s body and eyes to look for clues as he flew about the room. He found a black high-back chair here. There should be one here. Another one? A second blackhighback chair?\"Klein\" floated over in surprise. \"There should be a blackhigh back chair here.\" Sharron pointed at the splinters above two rocks.","9":"Klein placed himself in the shoes of the Dark Demonic Wolf and pondered. Usually, he would shut down the automatic prayer response to prevent an enemy from using the feedback to establish a connection and lock onto his position. The essence of this matter was that non-Mythical Creatures were marked by high-level existences. They could die in a baffling and tragic manner at any moment. To the supplicant, this was equivalent to suicide or something even more terrifying. Klein considered for a long while, but he wasn't a Sequence 1 angel of the Spectator pathway. He also thought of learning of the cosmos: just learning of it would be the result of corruption from the cosmos! If I had the nature of the Cosmos, then after the prayer point of light to monitor me, \"He\" would be corrupted, allowing me to be killed by \"His\" influence. It's meaningless... Yet, if I don't place myself in such a passive position, it will be difficult to bait an angel of. the Seer pathway, the paranoid demonic wolf... This is something that a marionette or others cannot do in my stead... If only I can be certain that the Dark. Demonic Wolf wouldn't rashly attack remotely because of \"His. paranoia and will only choose to monitor and observe... Thoughts raced through Klein's mind as he sought out the possibilities amongst numerous impossibilities. He could only sigh inwardly, feeling regretful for not being an Klein made The World Gehrman Sparrow shake his head indiscernibly as he surveyed the area. He focused his attention on The Star Leonard and The Hermit Cattleya. He hoped that they would be able to get advice from the existences that were more experienced such as Pallez Zoroast and Queen Mystic Bernadette. He would seek advice from Miss Messenger, Will Auceptin, and the ascetic, Arianna. However, the cosmos's nature is higher than that of an angel. How could I have it... I keep feeling like I've forgotten something... Klein made the glove on his left hand become transparent. He then \"Teleported\" away and disappeared from Fors and Xio's rented apartment. The Moon Emlyn had agreed to meet Maric two days before the meeting time. She was like a high-ranking knight leading an order of knights. She hesitantly said, \"The population in the surrounding villages has reached its limit. Besides, I can still get enough food from MI9 now.\" She paused and said, 'If the flames of war really reach Backlund, take them \u2018Traveling' to Intis and Feynapotter... it seems that's the only way...\" She then stretched out her right hand, which was wearing a red string, and grabbed into the air. The adventurer's eyes rolled and gained consciousness, reducing the amount of spirituality that Miss Magician had to expend. Emlyn and Klein knocked on the door of a nearby house. A figure wearing a dark and complicated long dress holding four blonde, red-eyed heads walked out from the void. Her skin was fair like a doll, and she wore an exquisite black regal dress and a small bonnet of the same color. Her blonde hair and blue eyes were slightly pale in color. The messenger summoned by the harmonica's historical projection was an objective existence. It didn't increase the spirituality burden of Forsythe. For some reason, Emlyn felt like he had been ostracized and didn't belong here. He looked at the Wraith in a daze, then at Gehrman Sparrow and the spirit world creature he summoned. The Wraith looked at him as though he was examining an idiot, and said, \"Alright.\" He cast his gaze on the high stool on the other side of the room. \"Miss Sharron, please come out for the discussion. I have limited time.\" As he spoke, he took out a silver adventurer's harmonica and blew into it. The door behind them seemed to have a life of its own as it slammed to a close. It opened automatically, revealing a dark environment blanketed with faint moonlight. The pair entered and saw the white-shirt and black-vested Maric sitting on the sofa. Maric immediately stood up, pressed his hand to his chest, and bowed at Sherlock Moriarty.","10":"After opening the \"door\" to the Body of Heart and Mind, Klein carefully extracted the memories related to The Fool. He gathered them together and \"Grafted\" them above the gray fog. Following that, he saw the blonde-haired Audrey, who had a light white silk scarf covering her eyes, appear on the ancient stone steps. Step by step, she landed onto his mind island via the sea of collective subconscious. She recalled her parents' love for her, the excitement she felt when she first became a Beyonder, and the joy she felt after helping others to change her emotions and emit corresponding fluctuations. This was a method of awakening Gehrman Sparrow's memoriesrelated to his humanity. It was a Beyonders manifestation of the effects of \"empathy\" The treatment was destined to fail right from the start, as Audrey's spiritual intuition gave her a strong sense of danger, although she couldn't see or hear anything. The treatment ended when Klein no longer allowed his consciousness to stay high in the sky. He gave up the corresponding control and allowed them to return and fuse together. The results of the treatment were shown in the book \"The Fool: A Guide to the Beyonder's Mind\" and the film version of the book will be released in the spring of 2013. The book is available in hardback and paperback, with prices starting at $20.99. For more information on the book, or to order a copy, visit www.thefool. Audrey was just about to \"Placate\" herself with all her might, weakening the corruption ahead of her when the firefly-like light dots floating above the island rapidly gathered. They illuminated the grayish-white fog, diluting the darkness around the strange door of light, making the tentacles covered in mysterious patterns shrink back. This made Audrey sense the weakening of the danger, and she quickly did a Psychoanalysis. Then, she immediately \"placated\" the corruption, performing a true act of hypnosis. She then left Gehrman Sparrow's mind island and returned to her body. Klein raised his hand to wipe his face, allowing The Fool's memories \"Grafted\" above the gray fog to return to his true body. He said, \"Pay a visit another two times this week. I'll be able to stabilize you under normal conditions. Yes, normal conditions.\" Audrey replied, \"I don't think it's that pessimistic, just like the source of every human life comes from something else: air, bread, meat, water, etc.\" Klein picked up the gold-lined cup and took a sip, \"This is the cruel law of the mysterious world. This is because our Beyonder powers come from external objects, from the Beyonder characteristics.\" Audrey nodded before shaking her head gently. \"Yes, every angel has one. The only difference is whether it's serious or very serious.\" Klein nodded. \"Even Low- and Mid-Sequ Klein summoned the projection of the Pride mask from the Historical Void. Immediately, he saw human-clothed animals walking upright. He had entered the Garden of Eden directly. He curled his lips and took out the Staff of the Stars and wore the silk top hat over his head. He mobilized Sefirah Castle and \"Deceived\" the rules. He then stood up and said to Audrey, \"If you give up on all your current identities in the mysticism world, and only be Mr. Fool's believer and Miss Audrey Hall from now on, you can avoid most of the risks of the former and drastically reduce the latter\" Audrey fell silent for a while. She bit her lower lip indiscernibly and asked, \"What if I do want to split off an identity?\" Klein said, \"As long as you let that identity believe in Mr. fool, it's not much different from what I said just now. The only difference is that, from this point forth, you'll have to stay away from your family and friends and live with another identity.\" Klein's voice sank slightly as he said in a serious tone, \"Also, are you really fine with Hermes splitting off an Identity for you?\" Audrey nodded gently, surprised, puzzled, and guessed something. \"I'm unable to pay the equivalent price, and...\" Klein said with a cold expression, \"I won't be able to escape a similar fate. As \u2018His' Blessed, I","11":"West Borough, Grimm Garden Street \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Klein, with a quite a stubble around his mouth, wore a pair of gold-rimmed glasses while carrying a top hat and a black cane. He followed Rogo Colloman into a spacious and bright living room. There was a huge crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling. The walls, corners, and tables were decorated with all kinds of golden carvings and ornaments. The entire area looked gorgeous, exquisite, and luxurious. However, the boy was wrapped in a thick fur coat and had a blanket that looked burning hot on his legs. At that moment, he had his head low, tightly hugging himself as he shivered nonstop. His dark blue hair seemed to have lost its luster. The color of Adol's aura had been dyed with a deep blackish-green sheen! This is a sign of being haunted by wraiths. Or perhaps, there were no such things as \"bad company\" at all...Klein quietly reached out, held Mr. Azik's copper whistle, and allowed his spirituality to spread. Then, he thoughtfully looked away from Adol and looked at the others inside theliving room. By the oriel window stood a man in a black coat. He was tall and sturdy, not smiling, and his waist was bulging as if he were hiding a gun. This should be one of the six bodyguards... Klein was about to size up another Klein and Stuart, a young man with a full beard, went to their rooms on the second floor. After dinner, you guys have some rest and take over your shifts in the early morning,\" Kaslana added. Adol sat in the rocking chair, holding onto Azik's copper whistle, quietly watching his ward. The two of them had arrived at their destination and entered their respective rooms. The sound of a gunshot rang out, and without thinking, Stuart rolled over, while KasLana and Lydia quickly got off the sofa, each finding a place to hide. The only thing left in his coat was herbal powder, extract essence, keys, and his wallet. There were a total of 206 pounds in paper bills in his wallet, and he was carrying a black cane. He had already transferred the paper figurines, notes, charms, a matchbox, etc to his trouser pockets. He was about the same age as Lydia, and almost as tall as Klein, a little over 1.7m and weighing 140lb. Stuart had an armpit holster, and in it, there was obviously a specially designed revolver. He patted his clothes with great interest, got up and asked, \"Why haven't I heard of you, Mr. Moriarty? I mean, I know a lot of people in the detective business, but I've not heard about you in the past.\" \"I only came to Backlund in early September,\" Klein briefly explained Stuart sipped his coffee at his desk while waiting for Adol to wake up. As time passed, a cold chill swept through the room. Adol's face seemed paler, and his lips were turning purple. Stuart was about to speak when he saw Sherlock Moriarty stand up and nod at him. \"I'll follow him.\" Stuart let out a sigh of relief and followed him to the entrance of the washroom two rooms away. He saw a young man standing a few steps away. The man was wearing a white shirt, dark trousers, and a pair of gold-rimmed glasses. He was leaning against the wall with a smile on his face. The figure in the mirror was so pale that it looked like a corpse. He turned around and glared at Klein's left hand, at the delicate copper whistle that was being tossed up and down. He continued smiling and snapped his fingers. With a loud bang, a flame rose from the ground, igniting an invisible figure. It struggled for a few moments before completely dispersing. The flames extinguished as a result, and the figure was no longer visible to the public. \"What happened to you?\" Stuart asked Adol in a soft, dreamy voice. \"It's been a long nightmare for me,\" Adol replied. \"And I'm not going to let you out of my sight. Heh, do whatever you have to do, and pretend that I don't exist.\"","12":"Mr. Door... This naming style is very similar to mine... I wonder what was the real name of this pathetic fellow who was lost and trapped in the deep darkness amidst the storms is, and what his Sequence is. Or rather, just as Emperor Roselle had guessed, he's one of the evil gods or devils...Klein let out a silent chuckle which was mixed with ridicule and self-deprecating humor. He was also interested in the history of the Fourth Epoch. To his surprise, the War of the Four Emperors described by Mr. Door clearly and unambiguously revealed one thing-all three empires had existed at the time! If this were true, then it would really overturn most of the current research on the current Epoch of history. Klein suddenly thought of the original Klein, who was filled with interest towards archeology and the history regarding the FourthEpoch. I wish if Death had already become a true deity during the 'War of the four Emperors' during the Four Epoch, I would have helped him achieve his goals. It's hard to determine according to Mr. door's descriptions, but Death went mad, but he also became stronger. Therefore, Death teamed up with the Primordial Demoness and brought about a Pale Disaster for the Northern Continent. Of course, this isn't something he witnessed personally, but rather something that he hears when he comes close to the real world every month. The Emperor of the Underworld reaped the Klein had obtained contradictory findings from the content recorded in the Antigonus family's notebook with his own mentor's viewpoint. He believed that the Dark Emperor was the common name used by every emperor of the Solomon Empire. He flipped through the next four pages and was disappointed to realize that they were no longer related to Mr. Door. His ability as a Clown allowed him to conceal his emotions well, and coupled with the gray fog's obstruction, even Audrey, who was secretly observing him, didn't notice anything amiss. \"I've had f**king sh*t for a long time, but still can't complain a little,\" he said. \"Of course, allowing the Church to attach great importance to me is that my greatest advantage is that the first few Sequences lack any powers needed for combat. I can only make way too much on external items\" For example, Sequence 9 Savant has extraordinary abilities in memory, learning, and practical skills. For Sequence 8 Savant gains a strong physique and corresponding ancient knowledge, and they can only apply some ritualistic magic. For. Sequence 8, the Archaeologist gains a corresponding physique and ancient knowledge. for. Sequence 9, the archaeologist gains extraordinary abilities. for example, for Sequence 1 is the peak existence of a single pathway. According to this logic, for Dark Emperor to live for centuries or over a millennium wouldn't be unacceptable. That would explain the original Klein's confusion. He felt that the future he imagined Klein's diary was written by Emperor Roselle Gustav, Consul of the Church of the God of Steam and Machinery. The diary details Klein's plans to gain Beyonder powers combat powers that he can call his own. He lampooned and remembered the unique trait of the church's members, who were good at making and using items, but not very powerful Beyonder objects. After reading the diary, Klein wrote: \"Am I going to end up as an all-powerful mad scientist? Heavens have mercy on me. I was only a second-tier student at the college entrance examination! I like that name.\" He continued reading: \"The Sauron family has witnessed the history of the Fourth Epoch and is an ancient family with a high possibility of having High-Sequence Beyonders. I need to be very careful. First, I'll let the rebels destroy order before I end it all as a protector. Consul RoseLle Gustav. Ilike that name. I like it. I can't appear immediately. First,. I'll letting the rebelsdestroy order beforeI end itall as a. protector. ILike that name! ConsulRoselle. Gustav. He like thatname. It had to be said that Emperor. Rosellle had a strange talent for making jokes. Even the recently dispirited Klein couldn't help but twitch his mouth, wishing to light a candle for this senior.","13":"Klein met Angelica at the Divination Club. She told him she had had a dream about Mr. Hanass Vincent and matters regarding him. Klein saw her emotions turn into a \u2018thinking blue', a normal reaction. She slowly looked up and said, \"I've met him before.\" Klein was stunned in disbelief. He felt like a shortsighted man who was wearing glasses that suited him. He could even faintly make out the details within Angelica's aura. His Spirit Vision turned clearer. He realized that his potion had begun to produce clear signs of digestion. He checked his body condition and reflected on his past experiences. He then took out the portrait and entered the club. He met the beautiful attendant, Angelica. She had seen too many people in the club who claimed to see through the truth and fate after learning divination methods. The more you know how small we are, the better you can understand how small you truly are, she told him. She then gave him the portrait of a man she had seen in a dream. The man was a policeman investigating Mr. Vincent's death. He looked at Angelica and said: \"I don't find it odd no matter what revelation you receive, for you are a true Seer.\" She replied: \"Yes, I am certain of that. I don't even know his name. To be honest, if it wasn't you, I would have suspected that any person showing me a portrait like this is Klein could basically narrow the essence of the \u2018acting' technique to \u2018actions corresponding to the name of the potion' Only by doing so could he change the state of his body, heart, and soul, making them closer to the remnant psyche in the potion, so as to gradually digest it. The acknowledgment of a Seer's identity was only a factor on the surface. The reason why it made one's spirituality feel light had to do with how the feedback strengthened one's affirmation of particular divination actions. These actions collectively formed the rules for digesting the Seer potion. If it continues to be this successful, I won't need half a year. Perhaps in two or three months, or even two to three weeks time, I'll be ready to completely digest the potion. That sign was extremely obvious. It's no wonder the mysterious Mr. Zaratul said that the Beyonder will clearly sense it when the potion is fully digested. There's no need for anyone to teach them. It is what it is... Just like now, although my Spirit Vision has been enhanced a little, I know very well that this is only a pit stop in the digestion process and not the final destination. If this clue is of any use, you would've contributed greatly once again. May the Goddess bless us.\" Klein tapped four spots on his chest as abnormally devout as he appeared. For him, he needed to figure out the identity of the man in the A Seer lacked the means to directly engage in combat with an enemy. Instead, a Seer could similarly deal with anenemy using ritualistic magic. It was exactly how he resolved the magic mirror divination incident at Selena's house. He realized that Selena had likely been brought by Hanass Vincent to the underground market. This resulted in Elizabeth's knowledge of the Evil Dragon Bar as well. The gentleman that had witnessed the exchange of the Antigonus family's notebook. The man in the portrait who had some relationship with Hanass. Vincent have come here before. He had asked me if I had documents or items related to the main peak of the Hornacis mountain range. The librarian had casually mentioned that someone had just returned it. Therefore, he still remembered very cleverly and didn't need to flip through his name cards to determine if the man existed. He kept what was left in his tiny inner pocket. He patted the cash note in his pocket and pushed open the door and strode in. He saw a muscular old man walk out with a torn Admiral's jacket draped over his shoulders. The blue-eyed elder's arms were thick and brawny and had the bearing of a military officer. He was a former Tingen Mandated Punisher Captain... Rumor has it that he was once part of the Royal Navy...Klein replied politely, \"Yes.\" \"If you're in need of money, feel free to approach me.\"","14":"Vice Admiral Edwina Edwards asked, \"Mr. Sparrow, have you received education?\" Gehrman Sparrow replied, \"University graduate.\" Danitz couldn't help but lampoon silently. He was unable to believe the fact that this crazy adventurer and bounty hunter had actually gone to university and even graduated! He had no way of putting a university-a hallmark of wisdom-with that of Gehrmen Sparrow together! Danitz decided to do something about the situation. He coughed twice and faced Vice Admiral EdWina Edwards and said, \"Captain, Mr. Gehr man Sparrow has some questions for you?\" He then let out a sigh of relief. If this stare down continued, he felt as though his persona would collapse. He didn't directly ask about mermaids, as he didn't want her to see through his real purpose, which would lead to unnecessary accidents. He quickly calmed his mood and said: \"Second question, do you know how to remove the mental corruption from a Beyonder characteristic?\" She shook her head. \"I don't know. I once imagined that it's possible by borrowing the power of an external force and reducing it to the smallest specks. This way, whether it's corrupted or slowly cursed, they would scatter or slowly vanish. As for the Beyonder characteristics, they will gather by bit due to their particular traits, eventually taking form again\" She then wrote and drew: \"Set off from Sonia Island, sail 1 Vice Admiral Iceberg can replicate or simulate the Beyonder powers of her opponents when they use them in front of her. Danitz, who had been listening by the side, had a dazed look on his face. Klein asked, \"Do you know where there are people who can make mystical items out of Beyonder ingredients or characteristics?\" Edwina answered frankly, \"I have grasped the corresponding knowledge. I can simulate it, but I cannot guarantee the success rate.\" Danitz curiously asked,  \"Captain, is it really the giants'?\"Edwina gave an affirmative answer. \"That batch of documents showed that there were still many giants active in the Fourth Epoch. Some of them had switched faiths to the God of Combat, while the others were left scattered, becoming the hunting targets of the humans. The sunken ship we discovered, along with some of the items inside, are very similar to the relics they left behind in their original settlement, so we have sufficient reason to believe that the lost King's Court belongs to the giants\" Danitz didn't say a word, but listened to Vice AdmiralIceberg's description of the City of Silver Sun and the Forsaken Land of the Gods. He quietly listened to her description, but he quietly said it's not far from the word 'Giant King's Little Sun' Klein's thoughts began to wander and he forcefully reined them back, and he nodded as if he was thinking about something. In this aspect, I'm stronger than \u2018Them'\u00a0- Klein. \"If I offer a sufficient price, are you willing to sell the key?\" \"Of course, unless I acquire additional clues to the Giant King's Court.\" Edwina continued to speak at a moderate pace. \"The Element Dawn is headed by Bernadette? Zaratul's prophecy is quite accurate after all. She can really be considered an important figure in the Beyonder world\" \"What kind of cooperation?\" Klein asked. \"They've always been fighting against the Moses Ascetic Order. It really isn't for money, and their goal is definitely something from the abandoned temple.\" \"What do you know about Element Dawn?\" \"It combined the elements of various schools of mysticism. It had its own set of theories, and its members were all proficient in spell casting and had mastery in many ancient witchcraft techniques\" \"I don't know anything about it,\" Klein said. \"I just want to know if you can help me with something.\" \"Yes, I can help you with something,\" she replied. \"What is it?\" \"The key to the Hidden Sage.\" \"The Hidden Sage is the key to understanding the past and the future. It's the only way to know what the future holds for us.\" \"I can't believe I'm saying this, but it's true,\" he said, \"but it's the best way to find out.\"","15":"After a full half hour of uninterrupted silence, Klein opened his eyes and slowly rose to his feet. He took his cane, put on his hat, and left the cathedral, taking a rental carriage back to Minsk Street in the dark. Shortly after midnight, Klein took out his key, opened the door to his house, and entered the empty guest rooms to search for the Book of Secrets. It didn't take him much effort to find the old book, bound in thick goatskin, in the wardrobe in a room on the first floor. He planned on waiting for the commotion to subside before deciding on which to take out and which to carry. After doing all this, he didn't even bother to study the Werewolf Beyonder characteristic or the bottle of biological poison. He simply washed up and laid in bed. In less than ten seconds, he entered the land of dreams as various fragmented scenes appeared alternately before him. In the clearing surrounded by the abandoned warehouses, the Machinery Hivemind came and went before coming again. The person in charge of investigating this incident went from being a team captain to an expert at the rank of deacon. He was holding a silver mirror with ancient patterns on it. On each side of the mirror was an eye-like ornament. They were built on the foundation of a black gem which looked serene and charming. The scene was played out in front of their eyes, but his head was hidden in the darkness. Ikanser was about to ask his teammates for their opinions, when a line of text in ancient Feysac appeared on the surface of the mirror. The word \"punishment\" was blood-red, as if it were dripping with liquid! The expression on Ikanser's face was twisted at first before it turned abnormally serious. The \"fireworks\" bloomed in a splendid and resplendent fashion as they lit up the entire scene. In this dreamlike scene, the man in the black double-breasted frock coat appeared once again. He faced forward, pressed his hat to his chest, and bowed slightly. He then said, \"Based on the principle of reciprocity, it's my turn to ask the question. If you answer wrong or lie, you will be punished.\" After reciting the statement, he quickly entered the dreamland and witnessed one scene after another. He saw a woman with a complicated black regal dress and messy blonde hair. However, her face was completely transparent,. as if she didn't exist. Two men with black fur all over their bodies. Only their backs could be seen as they were being pulled by strange arms. Finally, the changes came to an end as it fixed onto the blazing flames that soared into the sky. It was almost 8 o'clock. The sky was just beginning to brighten. The sleeping Klein awoke to the punctual church bells. He wanted to study his spoils from Klein performed a dream divination, but this time he didn't have the confidence to gain a detailed revelation. Therefore, he changed the divination statement to: \"Its positive and negative effects.\" In the gray gloom of the dream world, Klein once again saw tragic scenes. When the scene reached the end, the translucent brown bottle was placed into a cup with water. The transparent liquid inside gradually turned amber in color and was drunk. The person holding onto the bottle of biological poison was weakened at first before coughing. He found himself scalding as his condition turned for the worse. The dream quickly ended. Klein turned his attention to the Book of Secrets, which was bound in goatskin. He then casually flipped to the first page. It was a title page with simple patterns on it but with nothing written on it. He finally saw the opening line: \"We worship the moon, not the Evernight Goddess.\" He didn't know if the Biological Poison Bottle was effective in there. Klein rubbed his forehead, intending to do some experiments above the gray fog when he was free. He wasn't afraid of being poisoned at all in his current Spirit Body state, but he wasn't sure if the poison would work on him. He decided to leave it at this and study it in detail in the future. The effective range of the poison cannot be deciphered via a revelation. Even if the person holding the biological Poison Bottle doesn't open the lid, their bodies would get","16":"Amon's projection subconsciously turned its head and looked in the direction of the palm. It saw the pus-covered, one-eyed giant who had long since died. The curse of the grayish-yellow fog kept emanating from \"His\" body. But it was different from before. There were seemingly illusory black tubes behind \"He\" back. They extended all the way into the infinite distance, a mystery as to what they were connected to. The \"Twilight Sword\" tore through the void and jumped out from the spot where the Angel of Time, Amon, was standing. It ripped through everything around it, turning into a storm that could destroy this desolate moor. But no matter how the orange-red \"sword\" storm raged, it didn't harm \"Him\" at all. The Evernight Goddess had come to a certain level of influence in the Land of the Gods, other than the True Creator. She could use the Uniqueness of the Death Goddess to exert a low degree of influence on some things in the Forsaken Land. The former Chief of the City of Silver was very likely related to Artificial Death. This explained something-that for some unknown reason, those that could influence the Forsaken Gods could be more powerful than the Creator. And now, Klein considered the Evernight in some ways!Based on this reasoning, Klein suspected that the Goddess could use this power to help him in his most desperate hour. Klein wasn't one of Amon's \"Parasites\" either. Amon wasn't aware of the former City of Silver Chief's abnormality involving the black illusory tubes. Klein had no idea what the final outcome would be. He had mostly focused his attention on the fact that Amon's avatar had been replaced by \"His\" true body. After completing this attack, Klein, who was high above the gray fog, immediately cut off the connection between Sefirah Castle and the real world. He then saw himself-glazed eyes, on the brink of losing control. He saw Amon's projection which had circled around the bluish-black palm using an \"error.\" He had finally succeeded in committing suicide. The entire gray fog boiled as the entirety of Sefire Castle quaked. A vast amount of terrifying power gathered over, transforming into a torrent of lightning. The blue gems that lit up at the same time sent an illuminating light that surged down like a torrent, drowning Amon's avatars and his own body. The black tubes didn't persist, and they instead shrank back into the depths of the darkness. Dressed in the classic black robe, Amon stood in a classic hat and pointed hat and said, \"I am the God of Combat, and I am here to kill you all.\" The black giant immediately began to rot, quickly being reduced to bones and reduced to a point that kept Bladel \"existing\" \"He\" raised \"His\" head and looked into the sky silently for a few seconds, as though he was looking at Sefirah Castle through the fog of history. He discovered that the Beyonder characteristics that had been destroyed with his body had unknowingly entered the Historical Void. It fused with the Worms of Spirit from the past, turning them corporeal. The miracle of \"resurrection\" was essentially a deeper use of one's strength from the future. The number of resurrections I'm using now is depleting the number I'll have after I become a Miracle Invoker... From the looks of it, there's only one chance now. Tsk... Amon should be guarding my \"corpse\" now. If it really doesn't work, I'll just abandon my body and become an undead! Klein's mind raced. The whole story's origins was when I was reading the Cthulhu myth. When I saw the line about the stars being right, I suddenly thought of this: We often say that Cthulhu will awaken soon, but what happens if Cthulhu has already awakened...? For those who don't know much about Cthulhu, it doesn't matter. Just treat this name as an evil god. After all, the corresponding deities were completely reconstructed by me. He's a very patient God of Mischief... Yes, my current state can only be maintained for three days. After that period of time, I won't be able to borrow powers from the Past to resurrect","17":"\"No, it's just good luck. God was watching over me.\" Klein modestly stepped aside and invited Stuart in. Long before Stuart had accepted the mission, he already knew of Emlyn White's whereabouts. Stuart stood in front of the burning fireplace for twenty seconds before he sat down on the sofa. He looked at Klein, who was busy brewing instant coffee, and he said, \"I'm going south for a holiday to go fishing at Desi Bay for new year's. What about you? Do you have any vacation plans? We put up with Backlund's air for a year and work hard to save money, all for such a holiday.\" Stuart continued without end, \"We still aren't rich enough, otherwise I'd like to travel to Feysac, Intis, and even to the Southern Continent.\" After he finished making the coffee, Klein handed the man a white porcelain cup. Stuart took two deep breaths of the fragrant and warm steam and said very formally, \"According to our agreement, I'll share the reward I received this time with you. The Whites gave a total of fifty pounds, and you obviously did more than I did. Only fifty pounds? A vampire is only worth fifty pounds?\" Klein couldn't help but silently lampoon. \"Apart from Mr. Stanton, you're the best detective I've ever met,\" Stuart said with a smile. \"What great detective have I studied under? There's quite a number of Klein was stunned for a moment, but then he immediately felt a bit embarrassed. He laughed dryly and said, \"I can't tell the quality of the coffee. It's all the same to me.\" After sending Stuart off, Klein went to the butcher's to buy a few ox bones and some beef. He wanted to prepare beef bone radish soup for dinner and eat it with the leftover rice. In the evening, he smelled the tantalizing fragrance of the beef bone soup, and his Adam's apple bobbed up and down twice. He heard the doorbell again, as though it was a bugle to signal dinner time. The image of the visitor naturally appeared in his mind. It was the handsome but not masculine red-eyed vampire, Emlyn White. He was about to say something when Klein looked at his brown clerical robes and said with a knowing smile, \"You just came over from the Harvest Church?\" The vampire gritted his teeth and said \"That old man, that old man... How do I get rid of this inducing suggestion?\" He patted the clothes on his chest and said  \"Take me to the patient. There's a good dinner waiting for me.\" He sniffed indiscernibly, as if he had smelled something. \"Do you know most about Backlund?\" Klein responded without any curiosity. \"It sounds like he's rather proud of receiving a certificate for practicing medicine without practicing it\" Dr. Emlyn White visited Lawyer Jurgen's grandmother, who was suffering from lung disease. He gave her medicine that would help her breathe better, but it would only last for a few months. He also performed a divination on the Jurgens, and they decided to try it out. Mrs. Doris felt much better after taking the medicine, and said, \"I feel much better. Thank you so much, Dr. White!\" The Jurges were delighted, but they were also worried about the effects of the sun on the vampire. They decided to wait until after the winter to try out the medicine on their grandmother, and then try the sun again, if it was still working for them. The sun is a type of magic. Using Beyonder powers to create fake outcomes to make an audience happy is a form of magic that can be used to create a happy audience. It is not recommended to use this type of power on humans, however, as it can lead to the death of the person who is using it. The Beyonder can also be used for other purposes, such as to make people feel good about themselves, or to make them feel better about themselves. The Sun Brooch is a symbol of the power of the Beyonder, which can only be used on humans. It can't be used by vampires. It has been used by the Beyonders in the past, but only as a warning.","18":"The Second Epoch's subsidiary gods truly are hidden powers. I can't rule out the possibility that \"They\" have lived quite well all the way to the Fifth Epoch. I wonder if the God of Spiritual Creatures Tolzna and the Goddess of Misfortune Amanises managed to evade the authority retrieval operation by the City of Silver Creator at the end of the Second Ep Coch. After a moment of shock, Klein began thinking poignantly. After the Sanguine Ancestor Lilith, Mutant King Kvastir, and Annihilation Demonic Wolf Flegrea perished during the betrayal, the \"E3rly Elm of Fire\" ended, and the war broke out. \"The world was damaged, and it didiVt stop for centuries. This was when Siatas was born and had grown up in until she entered Groselle's Travels,\" said Audrey. \"After the supernatural races obtained a certain level of intelligence and had their own languages, creatures finally had some knowledge of history. It was only after \"Dual Era\" that the new generation of elves and giants gained some level of rationality. They were very interested in this, but it was a pity that it was abandoned during the Cataclysm,\" said Klein's, Leonard's, and Audrey's minds. \"It seems to be the Forsaken Land of the Land\" said Audrey, \"The East Continent, a place where the Giant King's Court was. \"I just learned of a legend that our elves originated from the Western Continent,\" Siatas said. \"Your Highness, is that really where the first-generation elves were born?\" \"To some elves, it definitely exists,\" the Queen of Calamity Cohinem replied. \"No, no, it's terrifying to have such a violent wife, who dares to take action!\" \"Sigh. Only a person like her would like and enjoy being a poet, but had the liberal inclinations of a poet\" \"At this point, I wonder what kind of woman like him needs a thief to rein him in?\" \"Yes, that's what I'm trying to find out,\" the woman replied. 'I'm not sure I want to know that much about it. I'm just trying to get to the bottom of it.\" 'I don't know what to say. I just want to get on with my life,' the woman said. 'What do you want to say to me?' 'What would you like me to say?' 'Why don't you ask me?'\" 'I'll tell you what I think,' she said, 'and then I'll say it.' 'I want to talk to you.' 'What's your name?' 'Siatas,' she asked. 'Somethings about me,' she replied, 'but I can't tell you anything' 'What is it?' 'The story of my life', she said. Klein, Leonard, and Audrey visited Groselle's blacksmith shop. After obtaining information from the subconscious, they would enter the book world's sea of collective subconscious and seek out the secrets that might exist in this book. The ones living in the book were just copies created by the bookworld. It was only when they died that they truly felt their love for one another. This is how they live together. Emperor Roselle once wrote a poem, saying \u2018for my love I'll sacrifice my life[l]'...\" \"Mr. World is feeling a little emotional... He's like a calm river on the surface, with a lot of undercurrents and eddies underneath... Audrey nodded indiscernibly and asked, \"Can we enter his dream? I want to get the Judge and Disciplinary Paladin's potion formula.\" \"No problem,\" Klein replied as he glanced at Leonard. \"I delivered one of Frunziar's items to Backlund.\" \"As a Spectator, Audrey acutely sensed the cruel reality behind those words,\" Klein said. \"It's been too long. If they leave, they will grow old, die, or even be reduced to dust.\" \"Yes,\" said Audrey. \"That's the way it is. That's how it's always been.\" \"I'm sorry,\" said Leonard, \"I didn't mean to offend you\" \"Yes, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.\"","19":"Klein wrote on a piece of paper with 0-08: \"George III plans to use this speech to bait out all his enemies who want to sabotage his ritual\" After Klein wrote the last sentence, the dim quill in his hand disappeared without a trace, as though it had never existed. \"I can only maintain it for about a minute or so... That's way too short, isn't it? A thought flashed through Klein's mind. He put down Groselle's Travels and quickly wrote: \"I summon some ice-cream for Will Au back at Backlund, and if I head out too frequently, we might run into each other. It's a little dangerous when eating it and it'll disappear in fifteen minutes... It's just splendid.. It's no need to worry about gaining weight at all.\" \"I hope it works... After staring at it for a while, he folded the piece ofpaper and stuffed it into his pocket. Then, he sacrificed Groselre's Travels back above the gray fog of Backlund\" \"It's a very possible problem when he has to head out to Backlund and that Amon is there, and that Backlund is there\" \"If you want to know the truth, you have to go to the real Backlund. You have to find the real Will Au and talk to him. He will tell you what the truth is, and you will find the truth.\" Klein couldn't help but mumble inwardly. He decided to change his clothes and leave the house because he had to keep his promise. Saturday morning, the sky was gray and misty. It made one feel inexplicably stifled. This was a common scene in Backlund's deep winter. Although the smog wasn't as thick and pungent like last year, the geographical environment and climate characteristics had determined that such situations would definitely exist for a long period of time. Furthermore, victory over environmental pollution was never something that could be declared in a year or two.After putting on a black coat that covered her knees, and a black veil hat, Melissa quickly walked to the door. Her brother Benson held his hat and shook his head. \"A young girl who isn't even twenty years old should be dressed like a teenager. You look overly mature and old-fashioned in that, understand? Old-fashioned.\" He then took out a silver pocket watch covered in vine-leaf patterns and snapped it open. \"Let's go. There's still a long way to go to the municipal square.\"Melissa tersely responded and went out into the streets with her brother. \"What do you think His Majesty will be talking about in his speech today?\" she asked. \"It should wait till the content is understood. Otherwise, they would be worse than a curly-haired baboon,\" Benson said with a smile. Benson asked his sister what was wrong with Mrs. Thomas. Melissa told him that she had a disease caused by anxiety. Benson looked at the back of the man and asked in puzzlement. \"Does he still need to do something else?\" he asked. Melissa didn't respond, but her expression was a little dazed. They walked forward silently, as if they were relying on inertia. They came out of their houses and from the streets they were on, like water droplets splashing upward. They merged together at the intersection, forming a tiny stream. The stream surged ahead, combining with other tributaries, and flowed into the square's entrance, interweaving into a majestic torrent. The torrents slowly surged forward, flooding the square. The people were either dressed in formal attire or holding canes, dressed up as gentlemen. Otherwise, they were dressed in blue, green, yellow, and red-colored skirts; sweaters and leather jackets matched with pants; or dark-colored petticoats. Their colors were dull. Despite this torrent of humans, Melissa felt like she was as puny as a water droplet. The handouts just happen to start after His Majesty's speech, so Mr. Thomas probably wants to go there directly. He's a decent gentleman, so he probably doesn't want others to recognize him. If one's late, there might not be any left. They'll have to go to the cathedral, the workhouse,","20":"Klein and Reinette Tinekerr were to move Abomination Suah, the Rose School of Thought Shaman, and many of their followers to the ruins of the battle of the gods. However, the second level of the Box of the Great Old Ones had an element of randomness to it. The act of sending things to the designated scene succeeded a handful of times. Most of the time, the selected destination would suffer an unavoidable change. This was something that couldn't be influenced with luck, and at the very least, no one below Sequence 0 could do so. Since it wasn't directly experienced, Klein could instantly dispel the Historical Void projection, enter Sefirah Castle to do a complete \"disinfection\" and sever all connections. This meant that they could only consider giving up on the operation, and he would undertake the responsibility of helping all participants escape from the battlefield and escape the Southern Continent. This way, they wouldn't be able to immediately sense that Klarman had been attacked. It was the same as not using any Beyonder powers to cheat at gambling. This left his heart filled with anxiety. Of course, he wasn't too worried. No matter where the box brought him and Miss Messenger, it was impossible to harm him in any way. He dispelled the Box and snapped his fingers, summoning a scarlet flame as he constantly jumped within them. At that moment, he heard an extremely evil roar. His mind went blank, and Klein used Creeping Hunger to flash to another side, avoiding the Blood Moon Arrow created by the Rose School of Thought's Shaman King. He grabbed at the void a few more times until he dragged out a figure. It was none other than the leader of the Church of Evernight's ascetics, the angel of the Concealment domain, Arianna. The eyes of Arianna's projection darted slightly as her eyes instantly turned dark and deep. Reinette Tinekerr, who was in a rather difficult situation and trying hard to create opportunities for him, finally managed to catch \"Her\" breath. \"She\" didn't get possessed by Abomination Suah, nor did \"She's\" become a real doll. The Shaman King could hardly stop him in an effective manner due to the unpredictability of where he would appear next. He attempted to use spells like \"Abyss Shackles\" to restrict Klein's movement, but the short-distance \"Blinking\" was simply too effective. Without the projection of the Chained God and \"His\" influence of the surrounding area, and the interference of Abomination, Klein was like a fish in water. He was free and relaxed. He only needed to consider how to deal with his enemy's spells every two \"Teleports.\" He was like an animal in water, he thought as he teleported elsewhere. He didn't dare to look directly at Abomination. He seized the opportunity and reached out with his right Abomination Suah had focused his attention on Reinette Tinekerr and subconsciously belittled Klein, leading \"Him\" to not only lose the help of the Chained God's projection, but also being thrown from the state of being the one who had laid in ambush to the one being besieged by four powerful angels. Without any hesitation, Emlyn waved his arm and threw the Vision of White at the Door of Summoning. Sharron's figure that appeared in midair distorted, turning into a human-sized puppet. It had messy, black-and-white hair and a pair of bright red eyes. As for Emlyn, he raised his left arm and revealed a translucent ring that was worn outside his gloved index finger. The ring seemed to be made of light-red amber, and there was a blood-colored gem embedded on it. It could project a door that led deep into the spirit world for a certain amount of time, summoning an unknown creature. Emlyn wasn't sure what he would obtain. He only knew that, under normal circumstances, the summoned object was usually slightly stronger than him, but the possibility of directly pulling out a demigod wasn't impossible. At the same time, even without the Sealed Artifact, he still had other mystical items to use, such as Leymano's Travels. With the notebook, he could summon the Unshadowed Crucifix to replace the vision of White.","21":"Klein planned on \"cleansing\" the Wraith in the gray fog before using Paper Angels to envelop the mirror-like objects that he had possessed before placing him into a cigar case that was sealed by a wall of spirituality. This way, Klein believed that, even if the Rose School of Thought angel wished to, it was impossible to use divination to lock onto his position via Admiral of Blood. \"She\" could've mutated Senor during the demigod battle royale in order to deal with him. Based on the situation back then, there was a guaranteed chance of success. Klein was like a jobless tramp who was debt-laden. He felt that there was almost nothing he was afraid of. He didn't carry anything else with him that he didn't want to carry on him for the rest of his life. He wasn't afraid of anything. He was just accustomed to doing so, as it gave him a feeling like he was truly controlling a puppet. He had a feeling that there weren't any latent problems with the Spirit Body Threads, which meant that there wasn't any need to use both hands to control them. He took out Azik's copper whistle from inside his body. He turned his right wrist and made the side with fewer patterns appear under the sunlight, making it reflect the light. The copper whistle had Senor's figure appear on it as it rapidly turned clear. The grayish-white fog was quickly emanated as hysterical Klein considered cashing out Admiral of Blood via the black market. He immediately used divination to gain the gist of its origins and usage. After dying at the hands of a Rose School of Thought demigod, this gentleman's Beyonder characteristic and psyche fused with an ordinary silver necklace that he carried with him, turning into a mystical item. The mystical item had two uses. One was to passively make the wearer lucky. The second use was to actively give an enemy bad luck, making the target unlucky. After being lucky, they would immediately meet with repeated bad luck. After all, Fate Councilor Ricciardo was unable to change my luck... Hmm, I'll just wear it on me for now. It has few negative effects on me. I'll sell it if there's a chance to pay off my debt with Miss Messenger. Miss Messenger wants gold coins, while I have gold pounds. It's nearly impossible to exchange 10,000 gold coins through the banks or official markets. From the looks of it, I will have to do it in batches, getting each Tarot Club member to change some of it...Klein soon decided on a name for the necklace:Scales of Luck!Following that, he cast his gaze onto Senor, who was standing reverently to his side. He began to study the powers a Wraith had. Forceful possession, Wraith's Shriek, Mirror Blink, Obstacle Penetration, death-related spells, On its reflective side was Senor's figure. Then, Klein brought the gold coin, Azik's copper whistle, Death Knell, and his suitcase back to the real world. As for Creeping Hunger and Groselle's Travels, one of them hadn't been fed, and the other might cause Klein to be swallowed into the book for carrying it for too long. Therefore, they were left in the junk pile above the gray fog. He followed the beach until he came to a residential area. He discovered that he was near Pritz Harbor. Instead, he changed his appearance, took a steam locomotive, and headed for Conant City in Desi Bay. He planned on circling the area once before changing his identity again. He saw that the buildings had completely collapsed, and there were deep chasms in the ground and charred spots everywhere. He jumped off the Blue Avenger and circled the ruins with his sailors, but they didn't discover anything of value. After an unknown period of time, a figure suddenly walked out from the depths of the ruins. He wore a double-breasted, pure black clerical robe. His facial features were clear and distinct, like an ancient, classical sculpture. His eyes were dark blue, nearing black. They looked lusterless, but were filled with dense blood capillaries. He soon boarded the ship which hoisted its sails and left the island. The plans to rebuild the harbor wasn't brought forward at all.","22":"Bernadette was wearing an Intis-styled blouse and was sitting there quietly. Her chestnut-colored hair was naturally draped over her shoulders, and her straight brows were spread out perfectly. She actually had the aura of a female professional from Earth, one that had been in a high position for a long period of time. Klein took off his hat and pressed it to his chest. With \"His\" level, it would naturally affect the people around \"Him\" If \"He\" was willing, this effect would definitely turn into a form of corruption... Klein quickly did a self-analysis and made a judgment. He pondered for a moment before asking, \"Have you attained what you wanted to achieve in Backlund?\" Bernadette slowly shook her head. \"No. You can even say that I failed. I predicted that it would happen in the second half of this year.\" Klein nodded indiscernibly and said with a sigh, \"I didn't expect the ones to start the war to be the Feysacians either.\" He sighed inwardly. The difficulty of Queen Mystic's advancement ritual was controversial. It all depended on one's luck. The root cause of the Uniqueness of the Death pathway hadn't been resolved. This made him suspect that Mr. Azik's life in the Northern Continent had always been under the arrangement of Amon's brother. If not, how did \"He,\" who had lost his memories, escape from the Klein and Queen Mystic Bernadette were sitting in the same room. She was preparing the ritual needed to advance to Sage. She also tacitly acknowledged that she possessed at least one Grade 0 Sealed Artifact. He asked, \"When did \u2018He' start changing? Do you think there was any prior warning, or something worth paying attention to?\" She said, \"Not long ago, he proudly said to me, \u2018Haven't you always wanted to know what's surrounding our moon and other planets? In the future, our journey might be towards the sea of stars.\" As Klein pondered over Queen Mystic's words, he suddenly recalled a key phrase and something else. \"Mr. Door had once told Emperor Roselle that once he had the ability, he could take a look at the moon. That would resolve many of his doubts. That's why I didn't call him father for many years. It's because he did too many things against the trend of the times and hurt the innocent. I couldn't accept my heroic father turning into a crazy tyrant... \" She said. \"I understand that he was suffering from despair, pain, and loneliness. I understand him as a drowning person, only struggling on instinct.\" When Klein heard that, he sighed and felt his emotions in turmoil. \"At your level, you should more or less know that there's corruption coming from the cosmos.\" He said. The original entity here referred to Emperor Roselle, who might've succeeded before being \"assassinated\" This way, when he revived from the astral world and regained his Uniqueness and absorbed the three Sequence 1 characteristics, he would no longer absorb the characteristics of Knowledge Emperor,Arcane Scholar, and another pathway. He could make himself pure; thus, free from madness. This was a way to live through death, but the prerequisite was that Rosellle's ritual had succeeded. He had died during or after the ritual, and not before the ritual. The Black Emperor does have the ability to revive, but once a new Black Emperor appears, the original entity would perish completely. This is the method needed for summoning my messenger,\" said Bernadette calmly. The fountain pen that was originally placed diagonally in front of her suddenly jumped up, as if it was held by an invisible elf before writing fluidly on the paper. \"We can cooperate on stopping George III.\" Klein sighed and said, \"I'll give you the method to summon my messenger.\" \"Alright.\" Bernadettes reached out her right hand and lightly tapped the table. \"I'm also doing such things for something that has slim chances, one that's almost impossible to happen. You want to stop George III?\" \"Yes.\" Klein nodded frankly. \"Why?\" Bernadett pressed in an unperturbed tone. \"Some ridiculous reasons that aren't worth mentioning.\"","23":"The actions of the messenger shocked Klein for a full five seconds before he recovered. He bent over and picked up the letter. He didn't unfold the letter immediately. Instead, he placed the letter into his pocket, together with the Slumber Charms. When Klein exited the carriage at Daffodil Street, he instinctively looked at the driver, Cesare, only to see his relaxed smile, as if he hadn't noticed anything unusual that had happened. He decided to maintain his gentlemanly behavior and not attempt to scale the pipe back into his room. As for his stained clothes, he would take them to the Blackthorn Security Company tomorrow and get a professional to wash them through the police department. That would prevent his clothes from shocking his maid Bella and his sister Melissa. He then entered the room, locked the door, and removed his clothes, before he fully relaxed. He took out the letter and began reading seriously. It can be inferred that Mr. Azik has lived for over a thousand years and is most likely a High-Sequence Beyonder. He would most likely have encountered the powers of many different Beyonders in his earlier lives. In other words, it isn't only the Shepherd that gives him feelings of familiarity, but jobs such as the Unshadowed, Demon Guardian, or Hunter that would do so. It's highly likely Mr Azik would find any mystical item that corresponds to a particular Sequence's abilities that can be imagined... That can be Klein thought about the 300 pounds lying around in his anonymous account. He had saved up completely identical to materials that were not identical to those he saved up for. He decided to try out the sacrificial ritual he knew of. Azik warned him that he had to be very cautious when using sacrificial rituals. The worst thing that could happen is that the ritual would fail. He thought for a moment, recalling the complex symbol on the back of his chair at the ancient bronze table. It was made up of a Pupil-less Eye which represented secrecy, and the partial contorted lines which represented change. That should be my symbol, or more accurately, that is what symbolizes me in the world above the gray fog. But I cannot be too sure of that, so I'll have to try it out... Even if the symbol is wrong, as long as I get my honorary name right, the target of the sacrifice wouldn't point towards some other entity. If you can make the corresponding entity very interested in your sacrifice, then \u2018He' will open the gates to \u2018His' kingdom for you after you finish reciting the incantations. This will allow you to construct a tunnel that connects to the gates of the kingdom where the corresponding entities resides. If the entity is interested, then your sacrifice is complete. If it is not, then you will have to build a new tunnel on your own accord. After he finished reading Mr. Azik's letter, Klein rubbed his fingers together and ignited a flame of spirituality. He burned the paper to ash and threw it into the rubbish bin. The next day, Dunn Smith, who had communicated with the Mandated Punishers and Machinery Hivemind, started to assign missions. Klein was tasked to investigate a number of people who had connections to Lanevus. But because of his suggestion and the policy of the Nighthawks, he didn't have to be responsible for the people he had met previously. He continued with his combat lessons in the afternoon. He saw many contorted lines appearing on its back. His muscles, skin, and bones began undergoing a strange transformation. He transformed into the unconscious man, completely identical in height, appearance, and demeanor! He then leisurely walked in front of the dressing mirror and saw the black glove on his left hand twitch. He then wore the man's clothes and wore them for the rest of the day. He had a vague understanding of his shortcomings long ago. He was cautious and rational when it came to things he made plans for, but once the events deviated from his original plans, he would easily consider only the good and disregard the bad when he was forced to be on his toes. He didn't want to court death... Klein extended his palm to cover his face. He wanted to go through everything that he needed to take note of before putting it into practice.","24":"Alger Wilson stood in front of a window, considering the report he had to produce when he arrived at Pasu Island. It was at that moment when the endless gray fog and a figure lording over him appeared. Alger then saw a dark red glow and saw a blurry figure resembling The World. He then heard the figure's calm words. He found it difficult to suppress his joy as a strong sense of bewilderment and shock emerged within his heart. He remembered very clearly that The World had only promised The Sun to obtain the Notary potion formula within three days at the last Tarot Club gathering. He hadn't mentioned anything related to the Ocean Songster potion formula, but in just days, this gentleman had obtained the rare Sequence 5 formula and even its main ingredient!What did he do exactly? Alger muttered silently to himself as he couldn't help but recall Gehrman Sparrow's cold and formidable appearance. The man was more and more unfathomable. Alger fell into deep thought, depressed to realize that he didn't have any items or money of equal value. He quickly calmed his heart as he focused on another matter. He tried a divination on Groselle's Travels which he had brought above the gray fog. To his surprise, the divination ended in a failure. The book didn't appear special in any way, appearing so ordinary that only history fans would notice it. Klein knew very well that the Spectator pathway's Sequence 0 had long Klein's eyes spewed out with blood as his ears were left with two black holes. His mouth and nostrils had white matter stained with blood spew out from them. The scene quickly zoomed in as a palace with a height of over two hundred meters occupied Klein's vision. The space was so large that it allowed any dragon to move freely within. The \"camera\" kept moving inward, and soon, Klein saw a book made of yellowish-brown goatskin. Its cover was blank as it floated in midair. Compared to its surroundings, it was amazingly small. It was written by an ancient god, a storybook that can automatically deduce the ending. When this book was formed, the Dragon of Imagination likely hadn't encountered the ancient sun god and was fine. It just begs the question if the ancient gods are stronger than the real gods of the present day. After some consideration, he thought of finding a chance to enter the book in search for clues. Once I encounter any trouble, I'll immediately return. I have to be careful and cautious...Klein nodded as he divined that leaving Groselle's Travels above the gray fog would bring undesirable changes to the mysterious space, but was not sure if he actually knew why this was a place that transcended the spirit world. After deciding to take a look, Klein threw the junk pile into the pile so as to prevent any accidents, he took off. Klein handed over the elf queen's golden wine cup to Edwina. She habitually studied the engravings and symbols on the cup before withdrawing her gaze in embarrassment. She then looked out the window and said, \"They'll be organizing a bonfire party. Will you be participating?\" Klein shook his head. \"I don't plan on participating either. Not everyone is like Anderson, who can quickly raise his spirits,\" she said with pursed lips. \"Actually, it's not necessarily a bad thing...Klein was momentarily at a loss for a response. And apart from \"giving lessons,\" Edwine wasn't good at socializing\" \"Are you selling that key that originates from the giants?\" Klein silently inhaled and broke the silence. \"Yes.\" She added, \"I can lend it to you for studying. You can decide whether to buy it before leaving the ship.\" \"Put this in Siatas's tomb.\" \"I'm sorry, I don't know what to do with it,\" Klein said. \"It's in the captain's cabin. I'm not allowed to take it with me.\" \"You can take it if you want.\" \"No, I'm sorry. I can't take it.\" \"What do you want with it?\" Klein asked. \"Put it in Sia's tomb\" \"I'll take it when I get back to the ship\" \"Yes, I will,\" she replied.","25":"Klein asked for an item from the spoils of your tomb exploration. Carlson refused the offer, mumbling, \"You have beer, while I have strong distilled liquor. It's not suitable for a toast.\" Klein drew a triangular Sacred Emblem on his chest. He then said, \"It is because of my belief in God that I've told you this information, not to the Nighthawks through Mr. Stanton.\" Carlson then blurted out, \"Aren't you a believer in God?\" Klein replied, \"I've always had the Goddess in my heart...Klein drew a triangle Sacred Emblem in the middle of his chest, and then drew a Sacred Emblem into the air. The Sacred Emblem was the symbol of the Church of the God of Steam and Machinery, which Klein was a High-Sequence Beyonder. He had spent the morning reading through the Bible that he had bought earlier, then found a few sentences from the deity that met his requirements and memorized them. Klein then asked, \"Which faction could have more than the seven Churches?\" Carlson responded, \"The church of the Evernight Goddess, of course.\" Klein then said he would tell the Machinery Hivemind about the tomb, and asked for a reasonable reward. Carlson then said goodbye to the bartender, and left the room to go back to his hotel room to get some sleep. The next day, he and Moriarty went back to the hotel, where they were met by the bartender. Klein told Carlson about an aristocratic tomb from the Fourth Epoch. The tomb was found at the mouth of the Stratford River in White Cliff Town. The items on the outside can prove that they're members of the Tudor Dynasty's Amon family. Carlson and Ikanser Bernard, the Machinery Hivemind's deacon, went to the bar to talk about the tomb. Klein gave a self-deprecating laugh and said, \"My reputation has always been.\" After making the deal, he sauntered out of the Lucky Bar and left the two men alone in the bar. \"I'll give you the information now,\" Klein said. \"We will collect the relevant information first before we act.\" \"Don't tell this to anyone else, or explore it yourself, or you will only lose their lives,\" Klein warned. \"If I dared, I wouldn't be sitting here here today,\" Carlson replied. \"And if I didn't, I'd be dead by the time you got back to me,\" Klein added. \"You're not dead yet, are you?\" Carlson asked. \"No, I'm not. I'm just waiting for you to tell me what you want to know.\" \"Then I'll tell you,\" Klein replied, \"and then I'll go back on my word.\" \"I have no right to agree to such a request. I will report it immediately, so wait here for a while.\" They'll have to have at least several days of preparing before they take action... Prudence...Klein's random thoughts froze on a single word. Why didn't Emperor Roselle dare to mention the name of that organization, even when it's written in Chinese? This is completely different from the style of writing where he dared to write anything in his diary. What was he afraid of, or what was he worried about? Could it be that as long as he said or wrote down the name, then they would be made aware of it it no matter which language he used? Does one of their members or a Sealed Artifact they possess have such abilities? A guess popped up in Klein's mind, but there was no way to confirm it unless he was willing to take the risk. Klein quickly made his next arrangements and strode out of Lucky Bar. He took a horse carriage to the Quelaag Club, intending to spend the afternoon there. But as he turned around and took a few steps, he suddenly heard a heavy thud. Klein jerked his head back and saw Talim Dumont on the ground, his left hand clamped tightly at his chest where his heart was. His body was convulsing nonstop. He had already spat out all of the white foam on his mouth, losing his last breath of life. In just a few seconds, he had turned into a dead corpse. His face was rosy, and he was sipping a","26":"\"What? He knows me?\" the chubby Apothecary, Darkwill, was alarmed as he whispered back. \"I wanted to buy a pet that can help me beat monsters and gangsters. I sought out Beyonder ingredients of a potion recipe according to the standards of a dragon, but I ended up getting a silly bird who only knows how to read newspapers and plays. Darn it. I want to stuff another potion down its throat!'\" the owl repeated like a parrot. \"Old Man always calls himself a lucky person and a winner of fate. He should be fine...\" Danitz said to Klein. \"Will the medicine brewed from this really be effective?\" Klein didn't respond to Danitz's doubts. He directly picked up the paper bag and threw it over. Danitz subconsciously retorted, \"I trust him. Although his mouth stinks and is rather vile, he has a rather kind heart... Besides, Captain Elland believes that his medicine is sufficiently effective... As Gehrman Sparrow, I'm in charge of brewing the medicine\" Danitz was accustomed to doing similar things recently, so he didn't have any urges to resist. Klein got a similar similar similar chair to sit in while he watched the Wind of Azure Inn. He then added water and the herbs into it, then felt his head feel groggy. He said, \"You haven't drunk it?\" Danitz nodded. \"Yes.\" He was very exhausted and felt like he could fall asleep at any moment. He forced himself to consider various problems to combat the fatigue and illness. The powers of a Sequence 5 Nimblewright Master of the Seer pathway is highly effective against invisibility. He can try to help the chubby Apothecary find his teacher in the meantime, but without any information, with just a picture, I can only try my luck. Most native residents secretly believe in Sea God... This is what it means by a sea of people. They can also check if there were any travelers named Roy King, who registered on any liners in recent months. There's another method. I've placed the radio transceiver above the gray fog for some time. I should be able to contact the magic mirror, Arrodes, if I take it down. I was originally planning on asking for Helene's location, but I no longer need to find the red-haired lady anymore. I can switch to Roy King. He no longer showed any doubt towards an ApotheCary's abilities. By night time, he had fully recovered. He wore his hat and left the inn with Danitz. Under the cloak of night, they left Bayam and came to a secret harbor hidden on the other end of the jungle. They used the Soulfall Ritual to contact Vice Admiral Iceberg Edwina. After some time, the ship, that was often scrubbed clean and had a Klein stood by the side with his hands in his pocket as he watched Edwina Edwards appear at the bow. She was wearing a hunter's hat, a rider's shirt, and a black coat. She matched the image of a female pirate admiral in the minds of the Resistance. If it were me, I would add porter gold from Masin, z\u0142oty from Segar, motif gold coins from Balam Empire, etc. At that instant, he felt that he had experienced just too many things over the past half a month or so. It was an unprecedented level of exhilaration, as though it was an interesting dream. He then described in detail things he couldn't explain in the letter. Towards the end, he mentioned in passing about the matter regarding Bansy Harbor, saying how it involved King of Angels Medici and \"His\" descendants. After returning to the Wind of Azure Inn, Klein was just about to sleep when he saw the surrounding colors turn abnormally bright. The white bedsheets turned whiter, and the brown floorboards turned more brownish-yellow. The dark red curtains appeared like fresh blood. In the scene with all sorts of colors stacked upon each other, Azik Eggers suddenly walked out from a rippling aqueous void. His skin was bronze in color, and he had soft facial features. He was dressed in his usual shirt, bow tie, tailcoat and a top hat.","27":"Admiral Hell Ludwell used the Beyonder power known as the Language of the Dead. It could circumvent the protection of one's flesh and blood, so as to target the Spirit Body. The bronze door which was covered with mysterious patterns remained standing erected in its original spot. It didn't vanish because of Ludwell's retracting of his left hand and subsequent actions. This was different from the similar-looking ability that Miss Sharron had previously cast using a mystical item. Klein jumped out of the darkness as he held a huge handful of charms from the Sea God domain. While these attacks inundated Ludwell, the extraordinary effects also augmented Admiral Hell. He was given augmented effects like Underwater Breathing, underwater mobility, flight, and pressure resistance, none of which were useful at that moment. Klein had planned on using the Priest of Light by clashing head-on with the bronze door with Light of Holiness to catch a breather, but he ended up seeing a glaring white fireball about half the height of a person fly over. The fireball's speed was augmented by the ridiculous suction forces generated by the door. It smashed Klein and smashed the door at the gap of the mysterious door. The door quaked a little and a few matchsticks in his pockets immediately lit up as he melted away. He instantly noticed that Anderson Hood was floating in midair in a rather awkward manner in front of him. He quickly shouted in ancient Hermes as the tin flakes lit up The Black Tulip sailed into another world. It was surrounded by countless shadows, wraiths, and undead creatures. The sailboat sank a few meters and swallowed a few mouthfuls of bitter and astringent seawater before it ultimately recovered. The crew of the sailboat were forced to abandon the vessel. They were forced into a new world, which was completely different from the one they had come from. They had to find a way to get out of the new world and back to the old one. The journey was very difficult. It took the crew several hours to get back to their ship. The ship had to be towed back to its original location. The sailors had to fight their way out of a hole in the middle of the sea. The battle was finally won by the Black Tulips, who had been forced to retreat to their home world. The fight was over. The new world was now safe and the sailors were able to return to their homes. The end of the world was near, but they had to wait until the end to find out what had happened to the previous world. They would have to go back and find out if they could get back into the old world. But they had already lost their way to the new one, so they could not go back. They could only go back to where they came from, and that was not very far away. The future was in the future, and the present was the past. Klein splashed a few times and floated to the surface, just in time to see the gigantic sailboat's tail meld into the darkness as the bronze door slowly closed. He instinctively swam forward a few seconds before ultimately stopping. He selected one of his remaining charms and gave himself the Beyonder effect of Underwater Breathing. At this moment, the starlight above the Future fell and condensed into a long bridge that extended over. If only Admiral Hell had hesitated a little and didn't flee in such a timely fashion...Anderson Hood sighed silently and firmly landed on the star bridge. He was just about to greet and praise Gehrman Sparrow when he saw the cold and gloomy expression. He made way and chuckled dryly, allowing Gehrmen Sparrow to walk past him. After returning to the Future via the starbridge, Klein held back his effusing emotions and watched Frank Lee walk over and give him a thumbs up. He thought in response that in terms of craziness, I'm far inferior to you... I was on the Black Tulip the entire time. He closed his eyes and felt his Faceless potion completely digest. He then opened his eyes to see Frank Lee standing next to him. He said, \"You're the craziest fellow I've ever met! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You actually dared to board the Black tulip alone and single-handedly challenge Admiral Hell. You even returned alive!\" He then turned around and walked away.","28":"\"The Fool?\" The Beyonders who attended Mr. A's gathering either ruminated over the phrase or conversed with their companions to discuss whether they had ever met anyone who had a similar faith. \"Help me find believers in The Fool. Of course, they might also be followers of the mysterious ruler above the gray fog or the King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck.\" \"The reward I'll provide will be so handsome that it will far exceed your imagination!\" \"Is it really a cult?\" The other gathering members were stunned when they heard their discussion. \"There's a link to that piece of paper with Mr. Fool's honorific name written on it. It was hidden in a book we borrowed from the Viscount Glaint's study...\"Suddenly, a name flashed in both Fors's and Xio's minds at the same time:ViscOUNT Glaint! \"Audrey brought the huge golden retriever into the living room under the guidance of her teacher, Escalante. \"Why are you looking at me like that?\" Xio and Fors shook their heads at same time. \"Nothing at all!\" Xio said. \"I just recited the honorificname of The Fool according to the ancient Hermes on that Piece of paper and was pulled above thegray fog.\" \"I don't have to be afraid of being investigated... No one knows about this, and I don't know about this!\" Audrey was attending the \"academic\" meeting that had been agreed upon last week. The room was lit by gold-plated candle lamps on the coffee table and cupboard. The lovers of both mysticism and psychology were either descendants of professors at universities, or the children of the rich. For example, a young man was the father of the owner of the most famous department store in Backlund. The only time Audrey was fully expressing her curiosity was by asking questions, expressing her yearning and yearning for answers. The meeting ended with a discussion of the Body and Mind as well as the collective subconscious world and the collective spirit of the world as the well and the subconscious world as well. It was the first time Audrey had been in a room with a man who was not a member of the Psychology Alchemists. Her maid and bodyguard stayed behind while she walked with Susie into a spacious activity room. In the activity room, be it for the atmosphere or some other reason, the gas lamps were not lit. Before Audrey could take a good look at her surroundings, she saw a gentleman in his thirties walking towards her. He wore a gray tailcoat. He appeared very gentle and elegant, nothing like a furniture merchant but more like a university lecturer. After sizing up Audrey a few times, he smiled and said, \"Escalante only mentioned that you were her student. Heh heh, I believe you're a cultured noble lady, Klein was jolted awake by the news Miss Magician had reported. The Aurora Order knows of The Fool? They know of my honorific name? The True Creator has locked onto me? He quickly rejected the final theory. If the True Creator had indeed locked onto him, Mr. A would have long visited him on the pretext of collecting a copper penny for the gas meter. Perhaps, even a Saint might appear. That is to say, only The Fool and his corresponding honorificname are known, and the clues point to Backlund... Who leaked the news?Klein frowned as he carefully thought about it.Soon, he discovered a possibility. Little Sun has recently chanted my name, and it happened when he was interacting with a member of the exploratory team who was corrupted. He held a sacrificial ritual, and there were likely symbols corresponding to The Fool at the scene. The ancient palace above the gray fog appeared. So, the true Creator sensed the existence of the Fool and confirmed that I was the one who had been sacrilegious, no-harassing, no that's not right either-spying on him. Through that, \"He\" has confirmed that my adorers and believers are in Backlund. I can't take the All-Black Eye out in the future!Having roughly understood the problem, Klein was left with another problem. Is he just dumb, or is he deliberately \"fishing?\"","29":"Klein conjured a gold coin and flicked it into the air, making a divination. The results of the divination indicated that today's development was nothing dangerous. Klein made his consciousness sink and left Sefirah Castle, allowing his mind to return to his original body. Immediately after, he began to influence Utopia. He planned to use all sorts of arrangements to temporarily make all the foreigners \"leave,\" so that if anything happened, it wouldn't affect the innocent. Klein was prepared to abandon Utopia and change locations to rebuild his marionette town. He was very sensitive to words like \"happened to,\" \"coincidence,\" \"simultaneous,\" and \"almost the same\" This was a mark left behind by his past experiences. He had trouble sleeping previously because of his anxiety and nervousness. That was why he thought of walking around the headquarters of MI9 to ease his mood. However, when he heard the conversation between his colleagues at night, it triggered an eruption in his emotions. He decided to go back to Utopia to face the problem. He took his luggage and went to the third floor of the Irises Hotel. He felt that the scenery outside was unusually familiar, but he couldn't tell what was happening too clearly. Thinking that it might have been the scene he had seen in Utopia, he covered his mouth with his hand and yawned. He covered the cover of the window and drew the curtains under the Monica slept until midnight when she suddenly needed to pee. She quickly relieved herself and ran out of the bathroom to her bed. It didn't take long for her to fall asleep again. About 15 minutes later, the patrolling Biles rubbed his hands and turned towards the street where the police station was. He was about to hand over duties with his colleagues when his body froze in the alley. The black and dense Spirit Body Threads on his body peeled off at the same time as they floated upwards. With Roselle's help, they reformed into three figures. The leader of the Secret Order, Zaratul, used the location provided by the historical projection to sneak into Utopia. The Worm of Spirit fused with the ugly doll, causing it to distort as it squirmed, growing out eyes, nose, and ears, making it look like Klein Moretti. \"He\" took out a black shroud and abruptly wrapped Klein's doll up! The doll was wet and sticky. It had no eyes, ears, or nose. It only had a pinhole-like mouth that emitted and sucked grayish-white fog. He didn't hesitate. With a thought, he returned to Sefirah Castle and thought about a button that had been pressed. He woke up suddenly, who was at the bottom of the Saint Arianna Cathedral, and knew that an accident had happened. He thought of a button he had pressed. With the level and strength of a King of Angels, he was able to resist enemies that had shown or had yet to show themselves. The moment the grayish-white fog entered his eyes, it turned into a whirlpool formed by countless transparent maggots. The vortex extended out slippery tentacles covered with strange patterns.Unlike previously, the vortex emitted a powerful suction force, causing Klein's figure to speed up and be entangled by countless tentacles. At this moment, many marionettes, who had been dead for a long time in Utopia, rapidly decayed from losing the Spirit Body Threads maintaining them. Their limbs dropped to the ground or mutated because of their Beyonder characteristics. The latter transformed into different monsters, ones far more terrifying than imaginable. After dodging Zaratul's fatal blow, Klein ran into the fog of history and fled towards the former metropolis from a time before the First Epoch. It was a safe room that could be trusted. This was because only a Scholar of Yore who was a human from before history could enter. The old metropolis was situated inside the old meeting place of Sefirah Castle. It had a thick, petroleum-slathered tree above Saint Arianna Cathedral. In addition, a deep and dignified voice resounded: \"Wandering is prohibited here! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Teleportation is prohibited in this place!\" The voice was that of Gehrman Sparrow, a cold-looking man wearing a half top"},"summary_target":{"0":"Boom! Silver lightning bolts strike the translucent black velvet \"curtain,\" allowing Reinette Tinekerr to return to Klein's pocket and the gold coin. Klein raises the Staff of the Stars, unleashing a Druid's power, causing the ground to turn into a marsh. The curtain, no longer restricted, collapses under the lightning storm, and the ancient castle is left in ruins. As the lightning subsides, Dark Demonic Wolf Kotar's castle lies in shambles, with red flames burning in many spots. Kotar and Klein emerge from underground, ready for another intense battle. Kotar uses the crinkled curtain to prevent Reinette's possession, while she transforms into a massive werewolf, engaging in a fierce battle with the demonic wolf. Meanwhile, Klein faces off against Kotar's three remaining marionettes, including a giant brown bear that he attacks with the Staff of the Stars, causing random abnormal changes. As the battle rages on, Klein dodges and weaves, using his cunning and the staff's powers to take down the marionettes, but the fight is far from over. ","1":"As Klein sits in the mysterious space above the gray fog, a blazing sun-like flame erupts, and a hurricane ravages the ancient palace. However, the destruction is short-lived, and the palace restores itself to its original state. Klein's brain is affected, with charred maggots crawling out of his head before returning to normal. He realizes that the being responsible is stronger than Dragon of Imagination Ankewelt. Klein recalls two scenes: one where the ancient sun god, likely the City of Silver Creator, wears a crucifix and speaks a language that stirs the powers of nature. The second scene shows the deity being eaten by the Kings of Angels, White, Wisdom, and Wind. Klein theorizes that the Unshadowed Crucifix was obtained by one of the Kings of Angels or Amon and Adam, and its effects make it an important item. He wonders if Adam arranged for the cross to be found and why it was given to Miss Magician and Miss Judgment. Klein's thoughts are filled with questions about the City of Silver Creator's high level and abilities, as well as the meaning of \"Mysteries.\" He decides to record the knowledge he gained about the Sequence 4: Unshadowed recipe and other Beyonder characteristics, all while fearing Adam's power and planning to have the Unshadowed Crucifix reformed into a pure Beyonder characteristic.","2":"Klein, still going by the alias Gehrman Sparrow, arrives in Nas, a city in the Gargas Archipelago, and is immediately struck by the pungent smell of canned wolf-fish. As he explores the city, he witnesses a protest against beluga whale poaching, which quickly turns violent. The protesters, demanding sustainable development, clash with the police, and the scene becomes chaotic. Klein, unfazed by the commotion, searches for an inn to stay and begins exploring the local cuisine, sampling various whale-based dishes. As he navigates the city, Klein reflects on the likelihood of encountering Faceless, Beyonders from the Seer pathway, and rationalizes that it's unlikely he'll meet many in Nas. He continues his carefree exploration, enjoying the local delicacies and taking in the sights and sounds of the city. With a harmonica in hand, a tool gifted by the Artisan that can summon a spirit world creature, Klein walks the streets of Nas, blending in with the locals. Klein's journey in Nas continues as he visits a sundry store named Hot Whale Dance, where he meets a grizzled boss and inquires about whale oil. His adventure in this peculiar city is only just beginning, and with his sharp wit and cunning, he'll navigate the complexities of Nas and uncover its secrets.","3":"Klein, still in disguise, visits the Ceres' manor, where he learns about Hazel's predicament after being bitten by her rat teacher, which has turned rabid. He suspects the rat is a Marauder demigod and leaves, wishing Hazel a blessing from the Goddess. Unbeknownst to Klein, Hazel is struggling with her own identity and the source of her strength, feeling lost and vulnerable after the incident. In her dark moment, Hazel experiences a hallucination or nightmare, where she sees her teacher and other gray rats with dark red eyes. However, she soon realizes it was an illusion created by someone with extraordinary powers, leaving her terrified and shaken. As she uncovers the truth, Hazel starts to piece together the motives behind the illusion, suspecting that the person was searching for her teacher. With her usual arrogance and confidence shattered, Hazel is forced to confront the limitations of her abilities and the unknown dangers that lurk in the shadows. As she attempts to regain her composure, she begins to formulate a theory about the true intentions of the mysterious person, setting the stage for a thrilling and unpredictable adventure.","4":"Duke Negan's pleasure is abruptly interrupted as his mind buzzes with an uncontrollable explosion of sensations, leaving him shaken and vulnerable. His Wind-blessed guard and secretary sense a mysterious, spiritual smell, leading the secretary to investigate the attic where he confronts the Desire Apostle. The devilish entity, covered in a thick black liquid, unleashes fireballs and chaotic energy, but the refined secretary manages to deflect the attacks using his unique abilities. As the battle rages on, the secretary's body begins to take on rusted red marks, and he coughs up blobs of congealed blood. The Desire Apostle, too, begins to cough up rusted blood, revealing that the Language of Foulness has partially backfired on him. Meanwhile, the Wind-blessed attends to Duke Negan, removing any potential threats and helping him recover from his weakened state. With his secretary struggling against the Desire Apostle, Duke Negan uses his conch necklace to call for aid, blowing into it and summoning the Holy Wind Cathedral's power. The tide rushes in, signaling the start of a new and intense confrontation.","5":"Emlyn White stands stiff, his mind blank, as he's confronted by Klein, who asks why he prayed to him. Emlyn recounts a revelation from his Ancestor, claiming he's key to preparing for the apocalypse, and Klein is taken aback by the detailed response. As Klein processes the information, he connects the dots, suspecting that either Lilith, the ancient goddess, is still alive or another deity is impersonating her, using the Sanguine as pawns in their game. Klein remains calm, inquiring about Emlyn's mission, and the Sanguine admits he doesn't know. The Fool's nonchalant attitude calms Emlyn, who realizes he's been pulled into a magical realm by a hidden existence. Emlyn, buoyed by his Ancestor's recognition, claims he'll be the key to saving the Sanguine from the apocalypse, which begins with praying to The Fool. Klein, amused by Emlyn's \"eighth-grader syndrome,\" ponders the true intentions behind the revelation. He proposes that Emlyn's Ancestor wants him to grow into a high-level entity with Klein's help, saving the Sanguine in the process. Emlyn is puzzled, citing the Sanguine's inability to grow without ceremonies and relics. Klein cryptically suggests there may be other ways, offering Emlyn an opportunity to discover the truth, which the Sanguine eagerly accepts.","6":"Klein meticulously prepares the ritual materials, pouring the Classical Metallurgist's potion formula and the blood of a Dawn Paladin and Derrick Berg into a ceramic jar wrapped in paper figurines. He stirs the mixture, then seals it with the Paper Angel, ensuring the removal of connections between the blood and its providers. Klein reflects on his outstanding gatherings, only missing Prisoner, Devil, and Demoness, and plans to visit Miss Sharron in person to request the remaining Beyonder blood. As he waits, Klein takes out a pen and paper, drawing a symbol to summon Arrodes, asking about Sefirah Castle. The magic mirror ripples with aqueous light, and Arrodes appears, expressing anxiety and panic. Klein comfortingly responds, and Arrodes shares rumors about Sefirah Castle, believed to be a \"kingdom\" formed from part of the Creator's body or something created by them. Arrodes reveals eight entities similar to Sefirah Castle, including the Chaos Sea, and shares rumors from ancient gods about the River of Eternal Darkness and the Brood Hive. Klein silently repeats the key information, sensing a connection but unable to piece together the clues. He then inquires about Dark Angel Sasrir's origins, and Arrodes begins to respond, leaving Klein with more questions and mysteries to unravel.","7":"Audrey, now residing in a villa, hurries to pay off her debts to Mr. Fool's Blessed and Mr. World, totaling 3,800 pounds. Meanwhile, she secretly concocts a potion in a laboratory, using a Psychiatrist characteristic and ingredients. Susie, her golden retriever, is the intended recipient of the potion, which Audrey hopes will enhance her abilities. As Audrey completes the potion, Susie's behavior becomes increasingly unusual, with her pupils turning vertical and dark gold scales emerging beneath her fur. Audrey watches anxiously, prepared to use the Psychoanalysis power to stabilize Susie if needed. In a separate scene, Daisy returns to her childhood home in a dream, where she encounters a mysterious police officer who questions her about the Capim case. Daisy shares seemingly trivial details, including her mother and sister's hiring of private detective Sherlock Moriarty to search for her. The officer listens intently, his warm smile hinting at a deeper interest in Daisy's story.","8":"As Klein converses with Sharron, he inquires about various high-sequence Beyonders and events, showcasing his connection to the mysterious world. He asks about a Prisoner pathway Beyonder who can control lifeless objects, and Sharron reveals the name \"Puppet\" and its demigod, Shanks. Klein also mentions Zatwen, and Sharron confirms his involvement with the Naturism Sect's leader. Klein's inquiries lead to discussions about the Rose School of Thought, a secret organization with a thousand-year history. Sharron shares her knowledge, revealing that they have around five saints, two to three angels, and Grade 0 Sealed Artifacts. Klein's questions eventually transition to his recent near-death experience, where he encountered the Mother Tree of Desire and the Rose School of Thought's ambush. Sharron's rare emotional reaction hints at her connection to the topic. Sharroninform Klein about the destruction of Williams Street by the Nighthawks and Machinery Hivemind two months prior. Klein ponders the circumstances, suspecting a connection to Baronet Pound's demise. He asks about the current situation, and Sharron describes the area's high-rise buildings and lack of surveillance. Klein proposes exploring the site together, mindful of their unwritten agreement. ","9":"Klein, still operating under the persona of Gehrman Sparrow, strategically ponders the advantages and disadvantages of being a \"weak\" target for the Dark Demonic Wolf. He concludes that his vulnerability could be leveraged to bait the angel, but the initiative would be in the Dark Demonic Wolf's hands, leaving Klein exposed to potential attacks. Moreover, Klein regrets not being an angel from the Spectator pathway, which would allow him to turn the tables on the Dark Demonic Wolf. Klein's thoughts are filled with the complexities of the situation, and he realizes that he needs the help of other experienced beings to devise a plan. He decides to seek advice from Miss Messenger, Will Auceptin, and Arianna in Backlund, hoping to gain new insights. Meanwhile, Leonard and Cattleya will consult with Pallez Zoroast and Queen Mystic Bernadette. As the Tarot Club members disperse, Leonard confers with Pallez Zoroast, seeking guidance on Klein's predicament. Pallez Zoroast suggests that the only viable solution is to seek help from The Fool, a powerful entity that even Amon cannot capture.

On his mind island, Audrey appears with a light white silk scarf covering her eyes and begins to awaken Gehrman Sparrow's memories related to his humanity. She recalls her own experiences and emotions, emitting corresponding fluctuations that manifest as firefly-like light points on the surface of Klein's mind island, representing cherished scenes from his past. Each point of light presents a different scene, showcasing Klein's human experiences, from childhood to adulthood. As Audrey's spiritual intuition guides her, she senses a strong sense of danger, as if a corrupting influence is about to overwhelm her. To counter this, she performs a Psychoanalysis and \"Placates\" the corruption, diluting the darkness around a mysterious door of light. After an unknown amount of time, Audrey finally achieves the initial results she expects, and the treatment comes to an end. As she leaves Klein's mind island, he wipes his face, and The Fool's memories return to his true body. Audrey removes her white silk scarf, muttering poignantly about the terrifying mental problems brought by godhood, to which Klein nods in understanding, revealing that angels, saints, and even some Beyonders suffer from this affliction.","11":"Klein, sporting a stubble and gold-rimmed glasses, enters a luxurious living room in West Borough, accompanied by Rogo Colloman. The atmosphere is warm, with lit fireplaces and golden decorations. They're greeted by Adol, a 15-year-old boy, who sits shivering and hugging himself, wrapped in a thick fur coat. Adol's dark blue hair has lost its luster, and his aura is tainted with a deep blackish-green sheen, indicating possession by wraiths. Klein discreetly examines him, detecting the telltale signs of haunting. As Klein surveys the room, he meets the other guests, including Detective Kaslana and her assistant Lydia, both armed with revolvers, and Stuart, who sits opposite them. Klein exchanges pleasantries, removing his coat and hat, and later impresses them with his imitation of a gunshot sound using his cane, catching them off guard. The tension is momentarily broken, but the air remains thick with anticipation. With Adol's condition and the presence of various detectives, the chapter sets the stage for a thrilling mystery to unfold. Klein's cunning and unique abilities have already made an impact, and as the story progresses, the stakes will likely escalate, putting his skills to the test.","12":"Klein delves deeper into the history of the Fourth Epoch, courtesy of Mr. Door's revelations. He learns about the infamous War of the Four Emperors, where the Dark Emperor, Blood Emperor, and Night Emperor fell, and the Emperor of the Underworld, also known as Death, emerged victorious. However, Death's newfound power came at the cost of madness, and he eventually teamed up with the Primordial Demoness to bring about the Pale Disaster. As Klein digests this information, he begins to form connections between the deities and their roles in the war. He wonders if Death had already become a true deity during the War of the Four Emperors and ponders the terrifying consequences of a mad deity. Mr. Door's mention of the Laws of Beyonder Characteristics Indestructibility and Similar Sequence Beyonder Characteristics Conservation sparks Klein's curiosity, leading him to speculate about the nature of Beyonders and the existence of an omnipotent creator. Klein's thoughts are filled with a mix of awe and trepidation as he considers the implications of Mr. Door's words. He raises his evaluation of the Dark Emperor, Blood Emperor, and Night Emperor, believing them to be pre-eminent mighty figures close to being deities. The darkness of the future weighs heavily on Klein's mind, and he can't help but wonder if the end of days is inevitable.","13":"Klein visits the Divination Club, dressed in his new combat attire, seeking answers about Hanass Vincent's death. He shows Angelica, the beautiful attendant, a portrait of the mysterious man from his dream, and she recognizes the man from a month ago, describing him as having grayish-blue eyes and messy eyebrows. Klein learns that the man had a rare conversation with Hanass Vincent, sparking his curiosity about their connection. As Klein converses with Angelica, he realizes that his Spirit Vision has become clearer, allowing him to faintly see the details within her aura. He attributes this sudden improvement to his Seer potion, which seems to be digesting with promising signs. Klein reflects on his past experiences and narrows down the essence of the \u2018acting' technique, understanding that maintaining respect and fear towards fate is crucial for a Seer. With newfound determination, Klein thanks the suited clown's lesson and bids farewell to Angelica, ready to embark on the next phase of his plan. The mysterious man's identity remains unknown, but Klein is undeterred, driven by his growing confidence in his abilities as a Seer.","14":"Danitz, still reeling from his captain's unexpected visit, decides to facilitate a conversation between Vice Admiral Iceberg Edwina Edwards and Gehrman Sparrow. As Edwina questions Klein, he's forced to feign nonchalance, revealing his university education and mastery of various languages, much to Danitz's surprise. Edwina's unflappable demeanor and patient attitude evoke a sense of familiarity in Klein, who's reminded of his own past life. Edwina thoughtfully responds to Klein's questions, providing detailed information about Beyonder creatures at sea, specifically the Naga tribe's quest for an underwater city. However, she disappoints Klein by not mentioning mermaids. Her cryptic explanation of the law of convergence of Beyonder characteristics leaves Klein pondering the possibilities, and her hypothetical solution to removing mental corruption only serves to emphasize the insurmountable challenge. As the conversation continues, Klein's thoughts wander to Edwina's impressive knowledge of mysticism, rivaling his own, and her alleged ability to replicate Beyonder powers. He's forced to rein in his curiosity, nodding thoughtfully as he ponders the implications of their exchange. The air remains thick with tension, and the stakes continue to escalate as the mysterious forces of Symeem Harbor loom in the shadows.","15":"Klein, exhausted from the intense battle, takes a break from reading the Book of Secrets and decides to store all the mystical items and Beyonder characteristics above the gray fog, choosing to wait for the commotion to subside before deciding what to take out. He's aware of his current weakness, with his spirituality drained and his Beyonder powers growing faster than his spiritual strength. After washing up, Klein uses Cogitation to get rid of his tiredness and falls asleep, entering a dreamlike state where he sees fragmented scenes. In the Machinery Hivemind, Deacon Ikanser Bernard is investigating the incident, using a silver mirror with ancient patterns to scry for answers. Despite the rats in the sewers tampering with divination, Ikanser manages to get a glimpse of the participants involved, seeing a figure in a black double-breasted frock coat, a middle-aged man in a dark red cloak, a woman with messy blonde hair, and two men with black fur being pulled by strange arms. As the mirror reveals more scenes, it becomes clear that the investigation is far from over, and the mysterious Beyonder world holds many secrets. The chapter ends with Ikanser's expression turning abnormally serious, hinting at the consequences of lying or giving a wrong answer to the mirror's questions.","16":"As Amon's phantom approaches Sefirah Castle, a gigantic bluish-black palm suddenly appears, blocking his path. The palm belongs to Bladel, the God of Glory, who has been dead for thousands of years. Despite being cursed, Bladel's body now sports illusory black tubes behind his back, which seem to extend into infinity. With a mighty swing of his broadsword, Bladel unleashes an unimaginable power, creating a storm that destroys the desolate moor. Meanwhile, Klein takes advantage of Amon's momentary distraction to regain his clarity of mind. He establishes a new connection with the dark red figure at The Fool's seat, and then resonates with it to return to Sefirah Castle. However, Amon's phantom remains obstructed by Bladel's palm. The monocled King of Angels utters a name \u2013 \"Evernight\" \u2013 hinting at the help coming from the Evernight Goddess. Klein has been anticipating this moment, recalling his research on the former Chief of the City of Silver, who had attempted to switch to Sequence 3 Ferryman of the Death pathway but ended up turning into a monster. This anomaly is related to the illusory black tubes, which are also connected to Artificial Death. Klein suspects that the Evernight Goddess can exert a low level of influence on certain things in the Forsaken Land of the Gods, which might just be the key to unlocking the secrets of this enigmatic world.","17":"Klein welcomes Detective Stuart into his residence, where they engage in a casual conversation about the cold weather, winter vacations, and fishing. As they chat, Stuart hands Klein thirty pounds as agreed upon, and Klein can't help but think that the reward is rather low for a vampire. The conversation flows smoothly, with Klein skillfully deflecting Stuart's questions about his past and detective experience. As Stuart departs, Klein reflects on the unexpected turn of events and the widening of his social connections in the detective circles. He spends the rest of the afternoon reading the Book of Secrets, realizing how much he still has to learn about mysticism. As evening approaches, Klein prepares a delicious beef bone radish soup and is interrupted by the doorbell, signaling the arrival of Emlyn White, the handsome vampire he encountered earlier. Emlyn's impatience is palpable as Klein greets him, and the air is thick with anticipation. Klein's knowing smile hints that he is aware of Emlyn's recent visit to the Harvest Church, where the effects of the Mental Terror Candle can be resolved. The stage is set for a thrilling encounter between these two enigmatic characters, and the outcome hangs precariously in the balance.","18":"Klein's mind is reeling as he processes the information about the subsidiary gods, including the Dragon of Wisdom, God of the Dead, and God of Dawn, and wonders if they managed to survive the authority retrieval operation at the end of the Second Epoch. Meanwhile, Audrey, acting as different female elves, engages in conversations with Siatas, delving into the history of the elves, including the unknown beginning years, the \"Sprouting Era,\" and the \"Early Era of Fire\" when ancient gods fought each other. As Siatas shares her experiences and knowledge, Klein learns about the existence of the East Continent, a place believed to be the Forsaken Land of the Gods, and the elves' traditions, including their language, customs, and idolization of the strong. Audrey's influence causes Siatas's dream to shift, reflecting the elf's subconscious memories and curiosity about the Western Continent, which Queen of Calamity Cohinem intriguingly suggests may or may not exist. Klein's analysis continues as Siatas's dream reveals more about the coral palace, Cohinem's enigmatic responses, and the elf's gradual emotional descent into melancholy, influencing Audrey and the others to ponder the mysteries of the ancient gods and the true nature of the Western Continent.","19":"Klein decides to use the dim quill 0-08 to write a warning to himself about George III's impending ritual, revealing that the king plans to use the ceremony to bait out his enemies before attempting to becomea god. However, using 0-08's power exhausts Klein, making him dizzy and forcing him to rely on his own spirituality to recover. He realizes that he can only maintain the connection for about a minute, which is much too short, and that he needs to be more cautious when using Groselle's Travels to summon 0-08 in the future. As Klein ponders his next move, he remembers his promise to buy ice cream for Will Auceptin and decides to leave his house despite the danger of running into Amon in Backlund. Meanwhile, Melissa and her brother Benson prepare to head out into the gray and misty morning, dressed in old-fashioned attire that sparks a conversation about the rising price of bread. With George III's ritual looming and unknown dangers lurking in the shadows, Klein must tread carefully to avoid detection by the Psychology Alchemists and Amon's brother. As he navigates the complex web of powers and alliances, Klein's cautious nature is put to the test, and his resolve to uncover the truth is solidified.","20":"Klein anxiously opens the second level of the Box of the Great Old Ones, unaware of the destination it will choose. The interior transforms into a miniature cosmos, and the scene rapidly changes, finally revealing a vast desert landscape. Klein, Reinette Tinekerr, Abomination Suah, and the Rose School of Thought followers are transported to this new environment, leaving the projection of the Chained God behind. As Klein tries to comprehend his surroundings, Abomination Suah's evil roar and auras bind him, restricting his movements. Reinette Tinekerr's curse, accumulated over a long time, is unleashed, but Abomination Suah withstands it. Klein uses Creeping Hunger to escape and flashes to another side, avoiding the Blood Moon Arrow. In this chaotic situation, Klein uses his Blinking ability to teleport and repeatedly reach out to the void, eventually dragging out Arianna, the leader of the Church of Evernight's ascetics. With her help, Reinette Tinekerr gains an advantage against Abomination Suah. Meanwhile, the Rose School of Thought's Shaman King attempts to restrict Klein's movements, but his unpredictability allows him to evade attacks.","21":"As Klein masters the control of Senor's marionette, he discovers the challenges of hiding its abnormalities from other Marionettists and the risks of using it as a shield. To mitigate these risks, Klein plans to \"cleanse\" the Wraith in the gray fog and seal it with a 3-layered interference effect, making it difficult for the Rose School of Thought to track him. He also reflects on the Mother Tree of Desire's control over its organization members, realizing that as long as he doesn't attempt to divine its secrets, he can use the marionette without triggering any problems. Klein uses Azik's copper whistle to test the marionette, and after confirming its authenticity, he surveys the area and picks up the silver necklace. He takes four steps counterclockwise, chanting an incantation, and returns to the real world. The copper whistle doesn't react abnormally, indicating no latent problems with the marionette. Klein then uses the marionette to rummage through Senor's pockets, finding a substantial amount of cash and 13 gold coins. As Klein contemplates cashing out the marionette on the black market, he realizes the risks involved and decides to hold off. Instead, he divines the origins and usage of the silver necklace, discovering it came from a Sequence 5 Winner from the Life School of Thought. With this new information, Klein is one step closer to unraveling the mysteries of the mysterious world he's entangled in.","22":"Klein meets with Bernadette, aka Queen Mystic, in his cramped rental apartment in East Borough, where she reveals that she has failed to prevent a disaster in Backlund, despite her preparations. The disaster in question is the Great Smog, which Klein had witnessed in his visions of the past. Bernadette explains that advancing to Sequence 2, known as \"the Sage,\" requires preventing a higher-level disaster, which she had anticipated but ultimately failed to stop due to Feysac's sudden air raid. As Klein converses with Bernadette, he can't help but think about the machinations of the powerful and the devastating consequences of the war. He suspects that Amon's brother has been manipulating events from behind the scenes, including Azik's life in the Northern Continent, and that the current war is part of a larger plan. This realization sends Klein into a moment of post-traumatic stress disorder, but he quickly composes himself. Klein advises Bernadette that the current war presents an opportunity for her to advance to Sage, suggesting that she use her Grade 0 Sealed Artifact to stop certain disasters from happening at critical moments. Bernadette nods in agreement, acknowledging that she possesses at least one such artifact and is preparing for the ritual to advance to Sage. The meeting ends with Bernadette's gentle but emotionless voice taking on a slight change, hinting at the intricate web of power struggles and ancient machinations that will continue to unfold.","23":"Klein's thoughts are still reeling from the dark turn of events with Hood Eugen, but a new surprise awaits him \u2013 a mysterious messenger from Mr. Azik, a powerful Beyonder who has seemingly sent a warning about dealing with Beyonders. As Klein processes this unexpected development, he can't help but feel envious of Azik's abilities, especially after witnessing the messenger's unusual powers. He pockets the letter, containing a cryptic message about Azik's search for his past and encounters with former teachers and students, which seems to hint at a deeper connection between them. Back in his room, Klein finally unfolds the letter, revealing Azik's apologetic tone and cryptic messages about his past lives. Azik mentions encountering Beyonder powers, including Rear Admiral Hurricane Qilangos, a notorious figure wanted by multiple kingdoms. Klein's eyes widen as he realizes the implications of this information, and his mind starts racing with possibilities. Azik's familiarity with the Shepherd's abilities sparks an idea in Klein, who sees an opportunity to manipulate Azik into helping him. As Klein continues reading, he becomes increasingly convinced that Azik is a High-Sequence Beyonder with a deep understanding of various mystical powers. The warning about sacrificial rituals and evil gods resonates deeply with Klein, who is now more determined than ever to navigate this treacherous world of Beyonders. With this new information, Klein is left wondering what secrets Azik holds and what consequences this new connection might bring.","24":"Alger Wilson stands on an ancient sailboat, stunned by a report from The World, who has obtained the Ocean Songster potion formula and its main ingredient in mere days. Alger is bewildered, wondering how The World achieved this feat, recalling Gehrman Sparrow's enigmatic presence and speculating that he may have entered treacherous waters to seek The Hermit's help. Alger is torn between excitement and anxiety, realizing he needs to reciprocate The World's favor but lacks items or money of equal value. Meanwhile, Klein begins to scrutinize Groselle's Travels, the mysterious book he obtained. He performs a series of divinations, first determining that the book isn't the Spectator pathway's Uniqueness, then attempting to uncover its origins. Klein's divination transports him to a dark, hazy world, where he witnesses a breathtaking floating continent, complete with ancient palaces and majestic dragons of various colors. As Klein delves deeper into the book's secrets, he becomes increasingly entwined in the mysteries of Groselle's Travels, while Alger struggles to comprehend The World's incredible achievement and find a suitable way to show his gratitude.","25":"Klein sits down with Carlson, a Machinery Hivemind agent, at a Southville bar, where he's come prepared with a plan. He proposes that in exchange for sharing information about the Amon family's tomb, he'd like to choose an item from the spoils of the tomb exploration, preferably a mid-Sequence Beyonder ingredient. Klein's not looking to take any high-Sequence items and is willing to settle for a reasonable reward. Carlson is taken aback, not only by Klein's request but also by his unexpected display of faith, as he pulls out a Sacred Emblem and quotes the Steam and Machinery Bible to justify his actions. After Carlson leaves to report Klein's request, he returns with Ikanser Bernard, the deacon of the Machinery Hivemind. Ikanser agrees to Klein's request, but with one condition: items with strong side effects and curses are off-limits.  As Klein negotiates with Carlson and Ikanser, his cunning and adaptability shine through. He's determined to acquire the resources he needs to strengthen himself and further his goals, all while navigating the complex web of factions and interests in the world of Beyonders.","26":"Klein visits the Apothecary, Darkwill, who's concerned about being recognized by Klein, having used a fake name in Loen cities. Darkwillmutters to himself about needing to be cautious and leaving the city if he doesn't receive news about Old Man by March. The owl on his shoulder exposes his true thoughts, and Darkwill chuckles it off. Meanwhile, Danitz follows Klein, curious about the Apothecary's medicine. Klein purchases the ingredients for his medicine, which Danitz is skeptical about, but trusts the Apothecary's reputation. As Danitz brews the medicine, Klein reflects on his battle with Vice Admiral Ailment, realizing the powers of invisibility and ailments are like a game bug. He considers finding the chubby Apothecary's teacher, Old Man, using his own connections, including seeking help from Sea God believers and introducing himself to a military contact.  As Klein receives the brewed medicine, he hesitates for a moment before drinking it, finally taking a step towards recovering from his health issues. With his health at risk, Klein's curiosity about the Apothecary's abilities and the mysterious Old Man remains piqued, setting the stage for further discoveries in the City of Generosity.","27":"Klein unleashes a barrage of incomprehensible words, calming the hurricane-like suction force produced by the bronze door and revealing that Admiral Hell Ludwell's Beyonder power is the Language of the Dead, capable of targeting one's Spirit Body. As Ludwell freezes, his spirit is tugged at by an illusory power, but he quickly regains control and charges at Klein with his iron-black rapier. Klein, however, summons a handful of charms from the Sea God domain and uses them to counterattack, producing blue wind blades and heavy waves that inundate Ludwell. The battle rages on as Ludwell opens his mouth and produces a silent screech, temporarily freezing the wind blades, and then raises his left hand, causing the black, square-shaped ring on his index finger to glow with an eerie light. The bronze door swells in response, increasing its suction force to an unimaginable level. Klein attempts to clash with the door using Light of Holiness, but a white fireball interrupts his plan, and he's forced to improvise, using scarlet flames to escape and reposition himself. Just as Klein regains his footing, Anderson Hood arrives, floating awkwardly in mid-air with a burning-white spear in hand. Ludwell's reaction is one of surprise, and he responds by removing his silver mask, unleashing a heavy, pale-white light that lifts the bronze door off the deck and into the air. The door grows to over thirty meters tall, becoming an imposing entrance to another world, leaving Klein and Anderson to face this new, intensified threat. ","28":"At Mr. A's gathering, a mysterious blackboard sparks intrigue among the Beyonders, as it describes \"The Fool\" with phrases like \"doesn't belong to this era\" and \"the King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck.\" Mr. A warns against using Hermes or other languages to decipher the text, promising a handsome reward for finding believers in The Fool. Fors recognizes the honorific name as that of Mr. Fool, and her mind races with connections to the Tarot Club, Viscount Glaint, and a mysterious paper from the Viscount's study. Meanwhile, Fors and Xio simultaneously suspect Viscount Glaint's involvement, their suspicions piqued by the description on the blackboard. As they converse, Audrey attends an \"academic\" meeting at the elegantly decorated house of Mr. Stephen Hampres, a charming furniture merchant. With Susie by her side, Audrey is sized up by Hampres, who guesses her to be a cultured noble lady, excited and full of love. As the Beyonders continue their fervent discussion, Fors's thoughts whirl around her connection to The Fool, and she fears being discovered. Klein, meanwhile, remains focused on his divination, seeking answers about Will Auceptin and the dark forces at play. ","29":"Klein pieces together the puzzle, suspecting Hermes as the mastermind behind the attack on Ariehogg, with Adam being an unknowing pawn. The true intentions of Hermes remain unclear, but Klein senses that Adam's true nature is shrouded in mystery, potentially tied to the ancient sun god or the Primordial One. Medici's address of Adam as a zealot takes on a deeper meaning, and Klein's divination indicates no immediate danger, but his past experiences leave him wary of coincidences. As Wendel returns to Utopia, he's haunted by the darkness surrounding him, and Monica's sleep is disrupted by an unusual chill in the air. Meanwhile, Biles's patrol is interrupted by the sudden appearance of Roselle Gustav's Sequence 1 historical projection, which absorbs surrounding information and creates an illusory ball of light. The projection forges normal-seeming information and follows the Spirit Body Threads to the Saint Arianna Cathedral, where three figures materialize: a hooded man, a dignified middle-aged man, and a grotesque, tree-like creature adorned with bloodshot eyes. The air is thick with tension as the true extent of Hermes' plan and Adam's true nature remain unknown, leaving the characters \u2013 and the reader \u2013 on edge."}}
