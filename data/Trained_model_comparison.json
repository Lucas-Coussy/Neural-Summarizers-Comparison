Kotar, the Dark Demonic Wolf, raises his head, transforming into a terrifying giant bear that's twice the height of a person. Meanwhile, Klein, still hidden underground, evades the lightning bombardment, using his black staff to attack the brown bear's shoulder. The brown bear, now split into two, tries to give Klein a \"passionate\" hug that could crush all his bones and squeeze his chest muscles, but Klein doesn't retreat, fearing the physical attack would lead to abnormal changes or strange effects. With the God of Wishes's suppression, these changes and effects wouldn't exceed that of a Sequence 4 Beyonder power.

Klein's thoughts wander to the possibility of encountering Faceless beyond Sequence 8, which are rare in the Feysac Empire. He decides to stay at an inn, registering Gehrman Sparrow as a cause as a Church of the Goddess of Faceless. The harmonica that fixed the summoning ritual of a spirit world creature, matching Klein's inward intentions, could be used for a year and a half, allowing him to stay in the city for free.

Klein suspects that the rat in the manor is likely the Marauders, but he's unsure why it went rabid and bit Hazel. As he ponders the possibilities, he recalls the incident at the ball, where a gray rat bit Hazel, causing her to enter a dream-like state. The gray rats crawl out from the corner of her bedroom, balcony, and bed, emitting squeaking sounds. She's in a similar state, her entire being turbid and muddled, her left hand wrapped in thick bandages, but there are no more signs of blood. Her expression is heavy, nothing like her usual arrogance, and she's afraid to inform her teacher, afraid of encountering danger and end up being sacrificed. Klein, meanwhile, has already noticed Hazel's actions thanks to his intuition, and he's not worried about her actions due to her item of higher level. He suspects that Hazel, who has an item of a higher level, could \"steal\" the flight abilities of birds and use that short period of time to cross the river, arriving within three hours. To go from North Borough's B\u00f6klund Street to Macht's manor in Backlund's northwestern suburbs would take three to five hours on carriage, but Klein suspects she could do it in less than an hour.

His body expands and grows a pair of huge bat wings that emit light blue tongues of flames, while the secretary's body is engulfed by a violent wind, sweeping him towards the wall. As the secretary tries to evade or dodge, he encounters objects that seem to have found lives of their own, avoiding him in ingenious ways. Meanwhile, the mysterious power that was \"sealed\" in here, had yet to be destroyed. The Desire Apostle, frustrated by the failure of his previous attempt, doesn't flustered by the fact that he couldn't control his desires. He spat out a word in the Devil, filled with foulness and filth, and says: \"Die at the same time! Die at the very same time!\" The room suddenly feels like it had been completely sealed, as if one can never leave the room unless effort is made.

As Emlyn ponders this revelation, he realizes that the Goddess who snatched the title of Lady of Crimson is already Sequence 0, corresponding to \"The Star\" in the Cards of Blasphemy. The Fool plays a key role in \"Her\" revelation, and Emlyn is intrigued by the prospect of cooperating with a yet-to-disappear ancient goddess. But how am I to cooperate with a goddess who knows secrets? Emlyn must divine whether or not to pull Emlyn into each gathering ahead of time, and Klein's revelation hints at a similar apocalyptic prophecy in the Sights in the Spirit World from Yellow Light Venithan. Klein also points out that the Abraham family's curse Emlyn White was pulled into a magical place by a hidden existence, and that the goddess is likely to report to you that you didn't get anyone afterward. The key to the apocalypse isn't you, but me! The Fool is not angry, Emlyn realizes. Is it because I represent the Ancestor? I am indeed special, and I wish to adhere to certain matters,\" Klein says, hinting at a deal.","36":"Klein drinks the Classical Metallurgist potion formula, seals a ceramic jar with Beyonder's blood, and uses Paper Angel to seal a full-body mirror with aqueous light to summon Arrode, his loyal servant. After completing the ritual, the pale golden words fade away, becoming silver once again. On the surface of the mirror, lines of words appear again: \"Eight,\" referring to the eight detailed records on the second Blasphemy Slate. Klein's thoughts wander to the River of Eternal Darkness, a pathway that may have produced a deity, but there's no clear evidence that this pathway has produced a true deity. As Klein ponders the possibilities, he asks Arrodes about Sefirah Castle and the origins of Dark Angel Sasrir, who may have come from the Chaos Sea. Arro Des answers that he doesn't know, but that he's loyal, lowly, and obedient servant. Klein then asks about Sasrir's current state, and ArroDes reveals that the ancient sun god was born from light and darkness, making Sasrir the Dark Angel. Klein begins to piece together the clues, but lacks the ability to piece apart the clues. He's left with a nagging feeling that he should be able to grasp something, but he lacks the knowledge to unravel the mysteries of Sasrir.

Meanwhile, Klein tours Oravi Island's port city with the mindset of a tourist, finding a brief and rare moment of relaxation in his tense life. He visits a bar named Sweet Lemon, where he consumes a juicy and sweet fruit. As he finishes his meal, he receives a dossier containing information about the red-eyed man from the Harvest church, Leonard Mitchell. Leonard's smile gradually freezes as his expression turns serious, and he repeats this name in his mind: Sherlock Moriarty. The Nighthawk shrugs and says, \"No, as long as you stop making me have nightmares.\" He then leaves the building and goes back to his office, leaving Klein to ponder the implications of his actions on the Harvest Church and the people of the port city. The dossier reveals that Leonard Mitchell is a vampire, currently under the jurisdiction of the Church of Earth, and that his parents had hired private detectives to find him.","38":"Klein and Sharron travel to the ruins of Williams Street, where Sharron reveals that Baronet Pound died during one of his revelries, ending Alista Tudor's final bloodline. As they explore the ruins, Klein learns that Williams Street has been destroyed by the Nighthawks and Machinery Hivemind. Sharron shares details about her encounter with Shanks, a demigod who claims to be the son of the Chained God, and the Rose School of Thought's leader, who attacked her outside Bayam. Klein asks about the Prisoner pathway Beyonder's power to attack lifeless items, which Sharron describes as \"Puppet\" and \"Abomination\" She also reveals that Shanks is an Abomination born 922 years ago, and that he's hiding the existence of Miss Messenger and Mr. Azik to avoid detection. Klein is stunned by Sharron's revelation, suspecting that she's aware of his existence and isn't affected by his abilities. As the group continues to explore, Klein wonders about Williams Street's future, and if Sharron has gone down to explore it. She declines to comment, and Klein wonders if Sherlock Moriarty is planning on heading down with her.

He places himself in the shoes of the Dark Demonic Wolf, placing himself in a passive position to monitor and observe the area. As he ponders, he realizes that he's not a Sequence 1 angel of the Spectator pathway, and learning of the cosmos would result in corruption from the cosmos, allowing him to be killed by \"His\" influence. However, the cosmos's nature is higher than that of an angel, and Klein is unsure how to manipulate it. He decides to seek advice from Miss Messenger, Will Auceptin, and the ascetic, Arianna, seeking advice from more experienced existences such as Pallez Zoroast and Queen Mystic Bernadette. As Klein ponders his options, he feels regretful for not being an angel. He makes the glove on his left hand become transparent, then \"Teleports\" away from Fors and Xio's rented apartment. Emlyn and Klein arrive at a nearby house, where they're greeted by a figure wearing a dark and complicated long dress holding four blonde, red-eyed heads.

This is a method of awakening Gehrmen Sparrow's memoriesrelated to his humanity, a Beyonders manifestation of the effects of \"empathy\" The treatment is destined to fail right from the start, as Audrey's spiritual intuition gives her aStrong sense of Danger, although she can't see or hear anything. The firefly-like light dots floating above the island rapidly gather, weakening the corruption ahead of her. This makes Audrey sense the weakening of the danger, and she quickly \"placates\" the corruption, performing a true act of hypnosis. She then returns to her body, and Klein raises his hand to wipe his face, allowing The Fool's memories to return to his true body. As Klein stands up, he says to Audrey, \"If you give up on all your current identities in the mysticism world, and only be Mr. Fool's believer and Miss Audrey Hall from now on, you can avoid most of the risks of the former and drastically reduce the latter\" Audrey agrees, but asks, \"What if I","41":"Klein, dressed in a gold-rimmed top hat and black cane, follows Rogo Colloman into a spacious and bright living room, where he finds Adol, wrapped in a thick fur coat and blanket, shivering nonstop.

By the oriel window, a man in a black coat, bulging as if he were hiding a gun, looms large, and Klein wonders if it's one of the six bodyguards. As he sizes up the man, Klein's thoughts drift to Stuart, a young man with a full beard, and the mysterious figure in the mirror. Klein's curiosity piqued, he inquires about Mr. Moriarty, asking about the detective's mysterious past. As the conversation unfolds, a gunshot rings out, and Kaslana, Lydia, and Stuart rush to hide in their respective rooms, while Adol sits in the rocking chair, holding Azik's copper whistle, quietly watching his ward. With a loud bang, a flame rises from the ground, igniting an invisible figure, which struggles for a few moments before dissipating. With the flames extinguished, the figure is no longer visible to the public, leaving Klein and the others to ponder the implications of this mysterious encounter, and what lies ahead for them.","42":", Klein reads the Antigonus family's notebook, intrigued by Mr. Door's description of the War of the Four Emperors, which reveals that all three empires had existed at the time. As he reads the diary, Klein's interest in archeology and the history of the Fourth Epoch is piqued, and his curiosity about the mysterious Dark Emperor leads him to uncover contradictory findings. He believes that Death went mad, but he also became stronger, and teamed up with the Primordial Demoness to bring about a Pale Disaster for the Northern Continent. Meanwhile, the diary details Klein's plans to gain Beyonder powers combat powers that he can call his own, and he recalls the unique trait of the church's members, who are good at making and using items, but not very powerful Beyonder objects. The diary reveals that the Sauron family, an ancient family with a high possibility of having High-Sequence Beyonders, may have witnessed the war of the four Emperors. Klein's mind races, trying to piece together the contradictory findings from the content recorded in the notebook with his own mentor's viewpoint. He wonders what the real name of the pathetic fellow trapped in the deep darkness amidst the storms is, and what his Sequence is.

Angelica's emotions turn into a 'thinking blue', a normal reaction, and she reveals she has met Mr. Vincent before. Klein's Spirit Vision becomes clearer, and he realizes that his potion has begun to produce clear signs of digestion. As Angelica hands him a portrait of a man she had seen in a dream, Klein realizes that the man in the portrait is a policeman investigating Hanass's death. With this revelation, Klein begins to unravel the mysteries of Hanass and the mysterious Antigonus family. He uses his divination skills to narrow the essence of the 'acting' technique to 'actions corresponding to the name of the potion' Only by doing so can he change the state of his body, heart, and soul, making them closer to the remnant psyche in the potion, so as to gradually digest it. As Klein continues to digest his potion, he begins to realize that this is only a pit stop in the digestion process and not the final destination. In two or three months, or even two to three weeks time, he'll be ready to completely digest the potion. That sign is extremely obvious. It's no wonder the mysterious Mr. Zaratul said that the Beyonder will clearly sense it when the potion is fully digested. For him, he needs to figure out the identity of the man,","44":"ine, Klein meets with Vice Admiral Edwina Edwards, who reveals that Gehrman Sparrow is a university graduate. Danitz is stunned, unable to believe the crazy adventurer and bounty hunter had actually gone to university and even graduated.

Klein then inquires about the Giant King's Court, and EdWina reveals that there are still giants active in the Fourth Epoch, with some switching faiths to the God of Combat. Klein is intrigued by her revelation, but Danitz remains silent, wary of revealing his true purpose. As the conversation unfolds, Klein begins to piece together the clues to the giants' involvement in the lost City of Silver Sun and the Forsaken Land of the Gods, while Danitz sits quietly by the side, dazed by her revelations. Klein's thoughts begin to wander, and he forcefully reined them back, reining in his thoughts as if thinking about something more important than the giants. With the conversation finally over, Klein sets out to find the Hidden Sage, the key to understanding the past and the future, and to uncover the secrets of the Beyonders. With his new abilities, Klein is determined to find out more about the giants and the Element Dawn, which he believes is headed by Bernadette, an important figure in the Beyond","45":"Klein returns to his house, where he searches for the Book of Secrets in the guest rooms, finding it bound in goatskin in a wardrobe on the first floor.

The deacon is about to ask his teammates for their opinions, when a line of text in ancient Feysac appears on the surface of the mirror, dripping with liquid. The word \"punishment\" is blood-red, as if it were dripping with fluid. The expression on Ikansers face is twisted at first, before it turns abnormally serious. In this dreamlike scene, the man in the black double-breasted frock coat appears once again, and it's his turn to ask the question, based on the principle of reciprocity. If you answer wrong or lie, you will be punished, the dreamlike deacon warns.

The black tubes extend all the way into the infinite distance, a mystery as to what they're connected to. Klein, meanwhile, realizes that the Evernight Goddess has come to a certain level of influence in the Land of the Gods, other than the True Creator. He suspects that the Goddess could use this power to help him in his most desperate hour, and that Amon isn't aware of the former City of Silver Chief's abnormality involving the black illusary tubes. As Amon's avatar is replaced by his true body, the gray fog begins to boil, and the \"Twilight sword\" rages through the moor, turning into a storm that could destroy this desolate moor. But no matter how the orange-red \"sword\" storm raged, it didn't harm \"Him\" at all. Klein's mind races, wondering what the final outcome will be, and what will happen to Amon's avatars and his own body. He's aware that the Beyonder characteristics that had been destroyed with his body have unknowingly entered the Historical Void, turning them corporeal","47":"ine, Klein invites Stuart to his flat to chat about his upcoming holiday, where he plans to go fishing at Desi Bay. Stuart reveals that he received a fifty-pound reward from Emlyn White's family, but Klein offers to share it with him. As they chat, Stuart reveals his desire to travel to Feysac, Intis, and even to the Southern Continent, and Klein shares his own vacation plans. Stuart is impressed by Klein's wealth and charm, describing him as the best detective he's ever met. Meanwhile, Klein is busy brewing instant coffee, preparing beef bone radish soup for dinner. In the evening, the doorbell rings, signaling the arrival of a mysterious visitor, who reveals himself to be Emlyn, the handsome but not masculine red-eyed vampire from the Harvest Church. Emlyn grills Klein about his mission, and the detective responds with a knowing smile, revealing that he's received a certificate for practicing medicine without practicing it. As the conversation unfolds, Klein's curiosity about Emlyn's true intentions and intentions grows, and he wonders about the nature of his connection to Backlund, the mysterious city where he's found himself on a mission to uncover the secrets of the supernatural world. With his thoughts turned to the future, Klein begins to wonder about the true nature of the world he's stumbled upon, and what secrets he might uncover. As he ponders the mysteries of the Beyonder, his thoughts are interrupted by the door","48":"ists Klein, Leonard, and Audrey visit Groselle's blacksmith shop, where Siatas, the Queen of Calamity Cohinem, shares her knowledge of the Second Epoch's subsidiary gods, including the God of Spiritual Creatures Tolzna and the Goddess of Misfortune Amanises. Klein's thoughts wander to the possibility that \"They\" have lived well all the way to the Fifth Epoch, having evaded the authority retrieval operation by the City of Silver Creator at the end of Second Ep Coch. Audrey shares a story about her own childhood, growing up in the Forsaken Land of the Land, a place where the Giant King's Court was once located. As they discuss the history of the East Continent, Audrey learns of a legend that our elves originated from the Western Continent, where the first-generation elves were born. Klein wonders what kind of woman like Cohinem needs a thief to rein in her violent husband, and he wonders if she has the liberal inclinations of a poet. Meanwhile, Leonard and Audrey are left to ponder the fate of their loved ones, wondering if they will return to the book world, where they will be forced to choose between living and dying. As the group continues their journey, they encounter a mysterious woman, who claims to be a poet, and asks about Klein's violent wife, Frunziar. The woman's cryptic words and cryptic hints hint at a complex web of secrets and secrets hidden beneath the surface of the","49":"Klein writes on a piece of paper with 0-08: \"George III plans to use this speech to bait out all his enemies who want to sabotage his ritual\" After writing the last sentence, the dim quill in his hand disappears without a trace, as though it had never existed. A thought flashes through Klein's mind, prompting him to summon some ice-cream for Will Au back at Backlund, and if I head out too frequently, we might run into each other, he writes. \"I hope it works,\" he writes, before sacrificing Groselre's Travels back above the gray fog of Backlund. Klein's thoughts are interrupted by his sister, Melissa, who advises him to keep his promise to find the real Will Au and talk to him. As Klein and Melissa head out into the streets, the sky is gray and misty, a common scene in Backlund's deep winter. The smog isn't as thick and pungent as last year, but the geographical environment and climate characteristics have determined that such situations will exist for a long period of time, and victory over environmental pollution is never something that can be declared in a year or two. With Klein's promise still on his mind, he changes his clothes and leaves the house, accompanied by his brother Benson. The atmosphere is somber, with the air thick with tension and a sense of impending danger. As they approach the municipal square, Klein and Benson are met with a throng of","50":"Klein and Reinette Tinekerr are to move Abomination Suah, the Rose School of Thought Shaman, and many of their followers to the ruins of the battle of the gods. However, the second level of the Box of the Great Old Ones has an element of randomness to it, causing the selected destination to suffer an unavoidable change. This is something that can't be influenced with luck, and at the very least, no one below Sequence 0 can do so. Klein uses Creeping Hunger to flash to another side, avoiding the Blood Moon Arrow created by Abomination's Shaman King. He then grabs at the void, summoning a scarlet flame as he constantly jumps within them, summoning the leader of the Church of Evernight's ascetics, the angel of the Concealment domain, Arianna. At that moment, Klein hears an extremely evil roar, and his mind goes blank, leading him to lose the help of the Chained God's projection and be thrown from the state of being the one who laid in ambush to the one being besieged by four powerful angels. As Klein struggles to regain his bearings, he's forced to rely on his short-distance \"Blinking\" spells to navigate the treacherous terrain. Meanwhile, Reinette manages to create opportunities for herself, avoiding Abomination and avoiding the Shaman King's influence. With Reinette's success, Klein's confidence grows, and he begins to feel like a fish in water, free and relaxed.","51":"oon's plan involves \"cleansing\" the Wraith in the gray fog, using Paper Angels to envelop the mirror-like objects that he possessed, and placing him into a cigar case sealed by a wall of spirituality. This way, Klein believes that, even if the Rose School of Thought angel wished to, it was impossible to use divination to lock onto his position via Admiral of Blood. Meanwhile, Klein takes out Azik's copper whistle from inside his body, making the side with fewer patterns appear under the sunlight, making it reflect the light. The copper whistle has Senor's figure appear on it as it rapidly turns clear, and Klein begins to study the powers a Wraith has, including Forceful possession, Mirror Blink, Obstacle Penetration, death-related spells, and Forceful Possession's Shriek. On its reflective side, Klein finds a gold coin, Death Knell, and his suitcase, containing Creeping Hunger and Groselle's Travels, which he plans to sell to pay off his debt with Miss Messenger. As Klein navigates the treacherous seas, he navigates his way to Pritz Harbor, where he finds himself in a grayish-white fog, surrounded by buildings that have collapsed and charred spots. With the fog enveloping him, Klein considers cashing out Admiral of blood via the black market, but decides against it due to his debt. Instead, he changes his appearance, takes a steam locomotive, and heads to","52":", Klein sits down with Queen Mystic Bernadette, who has the aura of a female professional from Earth, one that had been in a high position for a long period of time. He asks about her goals, and she reveals that she failed to achieve what she wanted to achieve in Backlund, and that she predicted the Feysacians would start the war in the second half of this year. Klein ponders the implications of this, suspecting that Mr. Azik's life in the Northern Continent had always been under the arrangement of Amon's brother. As he ponders this, he also wonders about \"He,\" who had lost his memories, and how he managed to escape from the Klein and Queen Mystic's clutches. Bernadettes reveals that \"He\" had recently changed, prompting Klein to wonder if there was any prior warning, or something worth paying attention to. She also reveals that he once told her, \"Haven't you always wanted to know what's surrounding our moon and other planets? In the future, our journey might be towards the sea of stars.\" Klein's thoughts are triggered by this revelation, and he realizes that the \"sea of stars\" refers to Emperor Roselle, who might've succeeded before being \"assassinated\" by Mr. Door. With this revelation and the revelation of \"He's\" changing, Klein's mind races to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos and the mysterious forces at play. He ponders","53":", Klein receives a letter from Mr. Azik, a messenger who claims to be a High-Sequence Beyonder who has lived for over a thousand years. The messenger's actions shock Klein, but he quickly recovers, placing the letter in his pocket, along with the Slumber Charms. As he exits the carriage, he notices Cesare's relaxed smile, as if he hadn't noticed anything unusual that had happened. Klein returns to his room, where he takes out the letter and begins to read it seriously, inferring that Azik has encountered the powers of many different Beyonders in his earlier lives. He concludes that Mr Azik would find any mystical item that corresponds to a particular Sequence's abilities that can be imagined, including the Unshadowed, Demon Guardian, or Hunter. With this information in mind, Klein decides to try out the sacrificial ritual he knows of, using the complex symbol on the back of his chair at the ancient bronze table. He recalls the Pupil-less Eye, which represents secrecy, and the partial contorted lines which represent change. As long as he gets his honorary name right, the target of the sacrifice wouldn't point towards some other entity, Klein believes. The worst thing that could happen is that the ritual would fail, and he'll have to try it out, even if the symbol is wrong. After reading the letter, Klein rubs his fingers together, igniting a flame of spirituality, and transforms","54":" in Pasu Island, Alger Wilson stands in front of a window, considering the report he had to produce when he arrived on the island. Suddenly, the gray fog recedes, revealing a dark red glow and a blurry figure resembling The World. Alger's joy and shock are palpable, as he recalls Gehrman Sparrow's promise to obtain the Notary potion formula within three days at the Tarot Club gathering. As Alger tries a divination on Groselle's Travels, the divination fails, leaving him depressed and confused. Meanwhile, Klein uses his Spectator pathway to explore the mysterious space, spotting a book made of yellowish-brown goatskin, written by an ancient god. The book doesn't appear special in any way, appearing so ordinary that only history fans would notice it. Klein decides to enter the book in search of clues, but is cautious, knowing that the ancient gods are stronger than the real gods of the present day. As he explores the book, Klein's eyes spew out with blood as his ears are left with two black holes, and his mouth and nostrils are stained with white matter stained with blood. The scene quickly zoomes in as a palace with a height of over two hundred meters occupies Klein's vision. The space is so large that it allows any dragon to move freely within, and Klein wonders if this is a place that transcends the spirit world. After deciding to take a look, Klein throws the junk pile into the pile","55":" in the Lucky Bar in White Cliff Town, where Carlson and Ikanser Bernard, the Machinery Hivemind's deacon, meet with Klein and Moriarty to discuss the spoils of their tomb exploration. As the conversation unfolds, Klein reveals that he's a believer in God, which surprises Carlson, who is surprised to learn that Klein has always had the Goddess in his heart. Klein then reveals that an aristocratic tomb from the Fourth Epoch was found at the mouth of the Stratford River, and that the items on the outside can prove that they're members of the Tudor Dynasty's Amon family. He offers to share the information with Carlson, but warns him not to tell anyone else, or explore the tomb yourself, as he will only lose their lives. Klein agrees to the terms, and the deal is struck, with Klein agreeing to pay Carlson a reasonable reward for the information. As they part ways, Klein takes a deep breath, drawing a Sacred Emblem to symbolize his belief in God. The Sacred Emblem is the symbol of the Church of the God of Steam and Machinery, which Klein is a High-Sequence Beyonder. The deal is sealed, and Klein heads back to his hotel room, where he plans to make his next arrangements. As he leaves, he hears a heavy thud, and sees Talim Dumont's body convulsing on the ground, his left hand clamped tightly at his chest where his heart was.","56":" in the Wind of Azure Inn, Danitz inquires about Klein's medicine, suspecting that it might not be effective. Klein, however, insists that it's effective, and Danitz agrees to help him with the brewing process. As they prepare the medicine, Klein shares his experiences with Darkwill, a chubby Apothecary who knows Danitz's past and has a kind heart. Danitz shares his own experiences, including his desire to buy a pet that can help him beat monsters and gangsters, only to end up with a silly bird that only knows how to read newspapers and plays. Klein explains to Danitz that Darkwill's mouth stinks and is rather vile, but he has a rather kind heart, and that he's in charge of brewing the medicine. As the medicine is brewed, Klein adds water and herbs, then feels his head feel groggy, indicating that he hasn't drunk it yet. With his head still aching, Klein begins to consider various problems to combat the fatigue and illness. He can try to help Darkwill find his teacher, but without any information, with just a picture, he can only try his luck. With the radio transceiver above the gray fog, Klein can contact the magic mirror, Arrodes, if he takes it down. He no longer shows any doubt towards an ApotheCary's abilities, and by night time, he has fully recovered, leaving the inn with Danitz.","57":"oon, Klein, Anderson Hood, and Gehrman Sparrow board the Black Tulip to confront Admiral Hell Ludwell. Ludwell uses the Beyonder power known as the Language of the Dead to circumvent the protection of one's flesh and blood, targeting the Spirit Body. Klein uses his Priest of Light to attack Ludwell, and Anderson Hood uses his ancient Hermes to communicate with the mysterious bronze door. The bronze door, covered in mysterious patterns, refuses to vanish, prompting Klein to launch a flurry of attacks against it, using his Sea God domain charms. As Klein's attacks inundate the door, he's augmented with Beyonder effects, giving him underwater mobility, flight, and pressure resistance. The door quakes, and Klein's remaining charms, including Underwater Breathing, provide him with an opportunity to escape. He swims to the surface, where he's met by Frank Lee, who describes him as the craziest fellow he's ever met. Frank Lee challenges Klein to a single-handedly challenge Admiral Hell, which Klein accepts. As the battle unfolds, the sailors of the sailboat are forced to abandon the vessel, forced into a new world, which is completely different from the one they had come from. The sailors must fight their way out of a hole in the middle of the sea, and eventually retreat to their home world. The battle is finally won, and the sailors are able to return to their homes. The new world is now safe, but the","58":"ists, Fors and Xio, discuss Mr. A's gathering and the mysterious ruler above the gray fog, The Fool. Fors recalls the piece of paper with Mr. Fool's honorific name written on it, hidden in a book borrowed from the Viscount Glaint's study. Xio recalls reciting the honorificname of The Fool according to the ancient Hermes and being pulled above thegray fog. As Fors ponders the connection, Xio shares her own story, revealing that she recited The Fool and received a handsome reward from the King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck. Meanwhile, Audrey attends her first academic meeting, where she meets with Escalante and Susie. As the meeting progresses, Audrey expresses her curiosity, expressing her yearning and yearning for answers. The atmosphere is somber, and the gas lamps are not lit, hinting at the atmosphere being shrouded in mystery. Audrey's curiosity is piqued, and she begins to ask questions about the mysterious leader and his followers. The meeting ends with a discussion of the Body and Mind as well as the collective spirit of the world as the well and the subconscious world. As Audrey leaves, she's greeted by a gentleman in his thirties, a professor of psychology, who asks about her studies and about Susie's golden retriever. The gentleman's demeanor hints at a cultured noble lady, and Klein wonders what secrets he might hold about Audrey's past.","59":"Klein, now in his original body, returns to Sefirah Castle, where he plans to influence Utopia to temporarily make all foreigners \"leave,\" to protect the innocent. However, when he hears the conversation between his colleagues at night, it triggers an eruption in his emotions, and he decides to return to Utopia. He takes his luggage and goes to the third floor of the Irises Hotel, feeling that the scenery outside is unusually familiar, but he can't tell what's happening too clearly. As he approaches the police station, his body freezes, and the black and dense Spirit Body Threads on his body peel off, forming into three figures. With Roselle's help, the leader of the Secret Order, Zaratul, uses the location provided by the historical projection to sneak into Utopia, using the Worm of Spirit to fuse with the ugly doll, causing it to distort as it squirms, growing out eyes, nose, and ears, making it look like Klein Moretti. The doll is wet and sticky, with no eyes, ears, or nose. It only has a pinhole-like mouth that emits and sucks grayish-white fog. With a thought, Klein recalls a button that had been pressed, allowing him to enter the former metropolis from a time before the First Epoch. With the level and strength of a King of Angels, he is able to resist enemies that have shown or have yet to show themselves."}}
