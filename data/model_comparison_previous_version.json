        "239": "Trissy had a ring from the Demoness Sect that was closely related to the Primordial Demoness. The ring melted like metal as it flowed into Trissy's head in a surreal manner. Prince Grove was surrounded by a grayish-white aura that emanated out of the void. The spear rapidly plummeted to the edge of the cliff.",
        "240": "The author ordered 10 sticks of pork belly, ten sticks of Pork ribs, five sticks of chicken skin, one set of chives, and one eggplant. Peng Deng sends a message after I enter the mini-mart: \"I'm not coming. My girlfriend says she's on a diet and doesn't eat supper\"",
        "241": "\"Even without the additional effects from the environment, the Axe of Hurricane is still quite a formidable weapon\" Xio handed Williams the portrait of Lanevus that Audrey had given her. \"Help me keep an eye out for this man. Find him as soon as possible\"",
        "242": "Klein was unable to adapt to the Loen Kingdom's monotonous and repetitive style of breakfast. He tried not to limit himself to toast, bread, bacon, sausages, and butter. His recipes had new additions such as pork-filled pastries from the south, Feynapotter noodles and roasted corn pastries.",
        "243": "Kapusky Reid was sitting in a reclining chair in his activity room. In front of him was a fireplace burning with charcoal. On his knee was a book of poems in ancient Feysac. Kapusky's eyes were unfocused as he stared blankly when he suddenly heard a light chuckle in his ear.",
        "244": "\"I was like a feral beast from the jungle,\" Azik said. \"I was sensitive, suspicious, self-abased, afraid; and I often showed a cold, indifferent, cruel side that didn't match the morality of a human\" \"I joined the army, becoming a knight. I raised a three-meter lance and charged at enemies\"",
        "245": "A Miracle Invoker needed to seek out and satisfy all kinds of wishes before they could make wishes and grant them. Klein believed that the ancient Greek palace and the twenty-two high-back chairs were conjured by the existence that was suspected to be the Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth for Blessings. He understood the possible origins of the apocalypse and why the seven deities had given tacit consent to the birth of a Black Emperor.",
        "246": "Fors whispered in Xio's ear, \"I will work hard to create it for you. If it's not successful, or if you can't be certain of it, we will give up\" Xio nodded solemnly and flipped Leymano's Travels to the charred-yellow page. It was filled with complicated, twisted, indescribable symbols and labels.",
        "247": "Klein and Leonard were counting the second hand on the clock as their red eyes welled up with tears. Dunn Smith carried the silver, bone-like square box into the reception hall with a solemn expression. In the air, there were countless black, cold, and smooth threads. They surged towards Megose and entangled her almost instantly.",
        "248": "Klein's true form rapidly vanished and entered the fog of history. He ran all the way to a time before the First Epoch, and he sat in the old stacked cities. A few seconds later, the fog began to churn and rapidly \"vomited\" a black shadow. The hill vanished without a trace, leaving only a crater.",
        "249": "\"Investigate the nameless island which led to the deaths of Grimm, William, and Poli. This can be done through the descendants of Edwards, Benjamin Abraham, and the descendant of the three deceased\" This was a letter to Queen Mystic Bernadette, so Klein didn't write the reason. After folding the letter, Klein found a candle and began the summoning ritual.",
        "250": "Klein felt his emotions rouse up for some baffling reason as all the pedestrians below seemed to be connected to him by some invisible threads. By viewing all participants as marionettes or actors, he attempted to control them into putting on a grand performance. Without putting up any resistance, he chained the original Spirit Body fragments with black threads, allowing him to slowly take form again.",
        "251": "\"No one knows the real name of the magical item, but the people who have come into contact with it call it the \u2018Creeping Hunger' Qilangsos uses a living person's soul and flesh to satisfy it every other day. Otherwise, it would consume its owner as a replacement.\"",
        "252": "Klein is a half-human, half-dead entity. He doesn't have blood to speak of. The value of Enzo's blood only makes him appear human most of the time. It also means that I can bring the Sea God Scepter to Calder\u00f3n City. It's a place that's deep in the spirit world.",
        "253": "Klein saw the altar, which was surrounded by layers of light, and the tall, thin figure standing in it. The figure took off its hood, revealing a beautiful, devilishly feminine face, with a left chest, shoulders, abdomen, and thighs all covered in squirming, sticky, disgusting flesh and blood. The smoke in East Borough and the factory district thinned.",
        "254": "Klein's eyes reflected a nearly transparent object. It appeared like a carapace of something, occasionally shrinking and vanishing from Klein's line of sight, and at times peeking out due to an invisible wind. Derrick followed Chief Colin into Afternoon Town. The streets were covered with signs of rotting flesh and dry pus.",
        "255": "Audrey met the councilor of the Psychology Alchemists, Hvin Rambis, at the residence of the furniture merchant, Hampres. Hvin gave her the potion formula for Dreamwalker. The ritual's essence is to be immersed in a dream and be unwilling to wake up from it.",
        "256": "Klein asked, \"Miss Justice, what do you need?\" She replied in a reserved manner, \"You know that I'll soon fully digest the Spectator potion. I hope that I can get the formula for the Telepathist potion so I can prepare the ingredients ahead of time\"",
        "257": "Inspector Moretti had just performed multiple ritual ceremonies, used two charms, and suffered a nontrivial scare. He needed to enter Cogitation to eliminate any problems. The buzzing sounds in Klein's ears and the throbbing ache in his head slowly vanished, bit by bit.",
        "258": "The Fool is one of the Major Arcana tarot cards. The organization that is seeking or cracking down on his Blessed is the Aurora Order. Fors wrote to her teacher, Dorian Gray, after she advanced to Trickmaster. She hoped to receive his praise and subsequent guidance.",
        "259": "George III plans to use this speech to bait out all his enemies who want to sabotage his ritual. If everything goes smoothly and nothing happens, he'll take the opportunity to consume the potion and reveal his trump card to aim for divinity. Klein didn't know if this fate and particular connection could increase the chances of a successful summoning.",
        "260": "Klein sent a message to Little Sun, informing him to prepare to participate in the Tarot Gathering. Cattleya, Audrey, and Fors instinctively turned their attention to The World Gehrman Sparrow after seeing Mr. Fool. Audrey felt that this was one of the signs of the apocalypse.",
        "261": "Alger, Audrey, Fors, and X cast their gazes at the figure at the end of the long,ottled table. They discovered that there was a smile in Mr. Fool's eyes. The Sun had previously been isolated in the Forsaken Land of the Gods. The City of Silver had the remains of the Giant Queen, Omebella.",
        "262": "Three in the afternoon at the Dock Union in East Balam Dock. Klein wore a thick sweater, a tan jacket, and a simple cap that brought him closer to the usual investigative reporters in style. He didn't know the Lanevus's current condition, nor did he know where the powerful Beyonder lingering around him came from.",
        "263": "Old Neil rubbed his temples and said, \"I believe we have a general idea of why the three of you engaged in a mass suicide. That notebook is also now purportedly in Ray Bieber's hands. Regardless of whether you are alive or dead, it will hardly influence any subsequent developments\" Klein thought seriously for a few seconds before saying humorously, \"This is just too unfair for those kidnappers\"",
        "264": "\"Are you looking for me...\" The moment the voice entered his ears, Derrick froze. The room was shrouded in darkness, making it impossible to see anything. However, there was a tint of golden light that was expanding in his two eyes. Derrick was locked at the bottom of the spire, sealed under the influence of mystical items.",
        "265": "Klein followed Fate Councilor Ricciardo under a bridge in Oravi Island's port city. He asked why his luck augmentation on him had failed. The councilor said that the reason was because of him, not Klein. He told Klein to get his Apothecary to augment him with good luck and get him to win money at casinos. Emlyn was given a suitcase with 7,000 pounds in cash.",
        "266": "Derrick was at the top of the spire, in the room that belonged to the Chief. Colin Iliad had the tall body that was standard of the City of Silver. His hair was grizzled, unkempt, and rather disheveled.",
        "267": "The organization known as the Twilight Hermit Order sounds even more powerful and mysterious than the other underground powers such as the Aurora Order and the Life School of Thought. Even the knowledgeable and experienced Mr. Hanged Man, who's closely related to the Church of the Lord of Storms, doesn't know of its existence.",
        "268": "The full-body mirror's surface had aqueous light ripple once again as it reflected a dark cathedral without any natural light. Klein found this scene very familiar as he immediately recalled what it represented-this was where Zaratul, who had turned into a monster, hid! However, deep inside the cathedral, the cluster of blurry and huge maggots were no longer present.",
        "269": "Klein entered the mysterious space after lunch, in an attempt to confirm a guess in his mind. He picked up a fountain pen he conjured, paused for two seconds, and then wrote: \"I am involved in a series of coincidences\" The topaz pendant stood still without any rotations, meaning that the divination had failed.",
        "270": "Klein had chosen the Red Priest card instead of the Black Emperor or Tyrant cards. The card allowed the relevant powers of the mysterious space above the gray fog to be further enhanced. Leonard saw a boundless grayish-white fog appear before his eyes as The World Gehrman Sparrow's prayers resounded in his ears.",
        "271": "Six headless men emerged from the dispersing fog. They were all wearing black cloaks and were headless. The wind blades inundated Klein like a machine gun. He had enough time to dodge half of it before his body was torn apart. Two scarlet fire serpents appeared out of thin air.",
        "272": "Cult? My attention is immediately drawn to this word. \"What has a cult got to do with us?\" a group member named \"Judgment\" asks. In short, once one is bewitched by the cult and accepts their gift, they will definitely have to pay a huge price.",
        "273": "Demon Hunter Colin Iliad held two swords that were smeared with ointment, and he ran towards that terrifying figure like a hurricane at high speeds. Behind the stone pillar was a grave, but it had already been destroyed, revealing two black coffins underneath. It was unknown who had opened the lids of the coffins.",
        "274": "Queen Mystic Bernadette seemed to have a sense of foreboding when she saw Gehrman Sparrow's arrival. She put down the ancient scroll in her hand and cast her gaze at the visitor at the door. Klein didn't stand on ceremony and said directly, \"I wish to borrow the Magic Wishing Lamp for a day\"",
        "275": "Klein and Emlyn White left Lawyer Jurgen's house and proceeded in silence. After waiting for more than half an hour and confirming that nothing unexpected had happened, they left. Emlyn said, \"We have many powerful mysticologists among the Sanguine. I will write to them for help\"",
        "276": "Klein slept in the one-bedroom apartment in East Borough's Black Palm Street. He was afraid that the suspected murderer in the black priest robe had accomplices who could be searching the streets for him. Klein met a middle-aged man in a tavern. The man told Klein that he had been chased out of his home by the landlord.",
        "277": "Alger Wilson stood in front of a window, considering the report he had to produce when he arrived at Pasu Island. It was at that moment when the endless gray fog and a figure lording over him appeared. Alger then saw a dark red glow and saw a blurry figure resembling The World. He then heard the figure's calm words.",
        "278": "Emlyn Alger was on a mission to monitor a man named Verdu Garcia. He was a member of the Abraham family that had concealed his identity. Verdu yearned to save Mr. Door so that the King of Angels could return to the real world. He had recently left Desi County and had come to the Rorsted Archipelago.",
        "279": "After a short pause, a brilliant silvery-white glow continued to stretch out in front of them, completely drowning out the two invisible barriers that shielded Colin Iliad, Derrick Berg, and Lovia. Klein's figure, in his black trench coat and silk half top hat, appeared. Without any hesitation, he aimed the Staff of the Stars at the side of the special evil spirit.",
        "280": "Audrey found a single-seater and sat dowoi with all sorts of thoughts running through her mind. She would work with the crazy adventurer to hunt the demigod. She could rent Leymano's Travels and get Mr. World to record Teleport before requesting Mr. Fool to pass it to her. She can also make a request to Ma'am Hermit for help.",
        "281": "\"She\" is actually related to this place... That's right. The people \"She\" erased are sent here, so it would be odd if she's not connected,\" says Klein. \"Her\" and the Fourth Epoch's Nation of the Evernight on the Hornacis mountain range.",
        "282": "\"Fountain of Unaging? Will you really gain eternal youth if you drink it?\" Donna widened her eyes and asked curiously. Elland didn't answer at once, and instead, he forked a piece of fried murloc rib meat, tore into it in two bites, and took a sip of Sonia wine. The sweet and smooth taste has completely nullified the cloyed taste of fried oil.",
        "283": "1045 Dreamwalker was observing the real world through the crimson star that represented Judgment. In the eyes of the king's faction, Ms. Xio is only a Sequence 7 and doesn't have any notable mystical items. If the matter concerning Viscount Stratford was really related to her, there must be a mastermind behind her.",
        "284": "Klein activated his Spirit Vision and slowed his footsteps, like a gentleman on an outing rather than on an errand. He took a large detour and slowly headed back to the place where the gigantic Devil dog had been killed. There were no traces of its presence on the street, and passersby clearly didn't know that a fierce Beyonder battle had taken place here.",
        "285": "Fors didn't dare to look up at the gentleman who was sitting leisurely at the end of the long bronze table. Klein asked, \"After Amon's avatar was purified, I coughed out a worm that was exactly identical to the one in the dungeon. Do you know what it is?\" The Sun conjured a projection of a translucent worm with twelve transparent rings.",
        "286": "Klein had once guessed that it was because of the existence of the evil goddess, the Primordial Demoness, that led to the Assassin pathway having members of the opposite sex turn into a female after Sequence 7. Who knew that Roselle's diary would indicate that the Primordialdemoness might've been a male in the beginning as well?",
        "287": "Audrey Fors gave the diary to Mr. Fool as payment for her previous blessing. The payment for the blessing was to first settle the \"debt\" while having the intention to show off a little. In the rituals corresponding to The Fool, many steps that could be omitted, and the price could only be paid afterward.",

It made Audrey turn to look at the street and take in the sights of people coming and going.She knew that this was a sign of the intruder leaving.",
        "572": "?\"Klein nodded his head. \"Yes, sir.\"Klein nodded his head. \"Why is he saying \"again?\"Klein replied with a chuckle, \"No, not really.\"Klein nodded his head. \"Why is he saying \"again?\"Klein nodded his head. \"Why is he saying \"again?\"Klein nodded his head.\"Then why don't you come to my place? I'll be right back.\"Klein nodded his head.\"You can return when it's completely dark after we have dinner.\"Klein nodded his head... Klein hesitated for a second and smiled. \"I'll be right back.\"Klein nodded his head.\"It will be my honor.\"When he entered, the black cat, Brody, was licking his paws in a corner. Jurgen didn't make much small talk as he stepped into the kitchen.Klein nodded his head.After Klein had hung up his coat and hat and put away his black cane, he stepped into the dining room and saw that the table was already covered with food-blackened steaks and mashed potatoes of the same color.Klein nodded his head.He wasn't surprised by this. This was how Mrs. Doris, Lawyer Jurgen's grandmother, cooked in her old age. The food didn't look appetizing, but they were delicious.Klein nodded his head. \"She's a good chef...Klein sat in front of J",
        "573": "? Even if I tell them of the existence of the Fallen Creator, they wouldn't believe me, am I right?\" Derrick asked anxiously.Audrey and Fors looked over curiously. At the same time, they shook their heads, indicating that they had never seen or heard of this kind of worm.Audrey thought with her mouth slightly open.\"Angel! What are you talking about?\"Audrey thought with her mouth slightly open. \"Mr. Fool sent an angel! What are you talking about?\"\"Mr. Fool really has an angel as an attendant! He sent an angel.\"Audrey thought with her mouth slightly open. \"Every angel has at least the power of a Sequence 2...\"Although that's expected and I've already expected it, it's still amazing because it has finally been verified! \"And only deities can control angels! \"Audrey's eyes shone with excitement. She couldn't help but wonder what Mr. Fool's angel looked like. \"I wonder if I'll be lucky enough to see that...She looked towards the end of the long bronze table with admiration and zeal. \"I wonder if I'll be lucky enough to see that...\"At the same time, her spiritual perception told her that Mr. World, who was always gloomy, had also sat up straight in shock, which pleased her inexplicably. \"I wonder if I'll be lucky enough to see that...\"Alger thought for a moment before saying, \"It should be",
        "574": "Cheek? Was the Primordial Demoness also a man in the past?Klein almost raised his hand to his chin.He had once guessed that it was because of the existence of the evil goddess, the Primordial Demoness, that led to the Assassin pathway having members of the opposite sex turn into a female after Sequence 7. Who knew that Roselle's diary would indicate that the Primordial Demoness might've been a male in the beginning as well?Klein nodded and said, \"I'll give you a chance to see if you can find out more about it.\"Klein nodded and said, \"I'll give you a chance.\"After a brief moment of silence, Alger looked thoughtfully at Miss Justice. He nodded and said, \"I'll give you a chance to see if you can find out more about it.\"\"Thank you,\" Audrey gracefully expressed her gratitude.Klein nodded and said, \"I'll give it a try.\"At that moment, Derrick hesitated and said, \"I'll give it a try as well. I've recently completed several patrol missions, but there's nothing out of the ordinary.\"Klein nodded and said, \"Very good...Klein said to himself, making The World shut his mouth.After a brief moment of silence, Alger looked thoughtfully at Miss Justice. He said, \"I would like to know the details of the assassination of Duke Negan. What kind of reward do you need?\"Miss Justice nodded and",
        "575": "Klein sighed. \"If you don't agree with him, then he means that the peak of The Moon's pathway is empty. The Sequence 0 is empty!\"Klein sighed. \"That's not right. Isn't there a Primordial Moon?Upon seeing this, Klein suddenly had this thought. \"What is the Primordial Moon?\"He had already anticipated that the \"The Moon\" card didn't represent the Goddess. Whether it was the faith of the Loen royal family, the Augustus family was actually so rich and powerful to be an Angel Family. However, why did the royal family of the Trunsoest Dynasty, to which they were loyal to, \"disappear\" just like that...Klein suddenly thought of a few things, and his desire to clear away the fog that shrouded the history of the Fourth Epoch and see its true appearance grew.\"This was also the greatest hobby of his body's original owner. Heh, heh, heh.\"Perhaps, that underground relic with two side-by-side seats and a terrifying evil spirit will help me answer a lot of questions...Klein lowered his gaze and flipped to the third page. \"What is the Primordial Moon?\" he asked himself.\"The Primordial Moon\"2nd June, Bernadette massaged my back!\"It's good to have a daughter. She knows to care for her old father, and although I can see what she wants at a glance, at least she"
