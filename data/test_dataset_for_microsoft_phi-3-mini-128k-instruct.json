Boom! Boom!\nThe bolts of silver lightning that were as thick as an anaconda struck the translucent black velvet \"curtain.\" It shook violently as it distorted.\nTaking advantage of this opening, Reinette Tinekerr's figure, which was reflected on the castle's glass, jumped back into Klein's pocket and returned to the surface of the gold coin in the iron cigar case.\nThe prepared Klein raised his right arm and calmly aimed the Staff of the Stars at the floor tiles in the hall.\nA scene surfaced in his mind. It represented one of the Beyonder powers of a Druid.\nThe ground beneath his feet instantly softened, turning into a marsh. It made his body sink like it had fallen into a sea.\nUnderground Slink!\nBoom!\nThe translucent black velvet \"curtain\" could no longer withstand the cleansing from the lightning storm the moment the marsh solidified. It curled into a ball and fell back into the castle.\nNo longer restricted, the few thousand thick bolts of lightning rained down the ancient castle.\nA tower collapsed and the hall was left in shambles. One marionette after another burst into ephemeral illusions under the pricking of such a lightning strike. They were instantly charred black and reduced to ashes.\nWhen the silver light that illuminated the entire mountain range subsided, Dark Demonic Wolf Kotar's castle was in ruins. Many spots were burning with red flames.\nKlein immediately emerged from the bottom of a deep pit and saw that the demonic wolf, covered in dark and short fur, had performed the same action.\nRelying on the three Druids among \"His\" marionettes, \"He\" had successfully hidden underground to avoid the lightning bombardment.\nAnd at that moment, the independent \"kingdom\" created by the \"curtain\" had completely disintegrated. However, the Dark Demonic Wolf's wish hadn't completely expired. The return of godhood still needed some time.\nWithout any hesitation, both parties engaged in another intense battle.\nKotar allowed the crinkled \"curtain\" to fly up and drape \"Him,\" so as to prevent the Wraith's possession. After all, there were only three of \"His\" marionettes left. Of course, this way, \"He\" could no longer swap locations with his marionettes.\nAt the same time, Reinette Tinekerr left the gold coin in Klein's pocket and floated towards the eight-legged demonic wolf.\n\"She\" had given up on the idea of possession as \"Her\" arms suddenly swelled. A few strands of gray hair grew from the back of \"Her\" hand, and \"Her\" nails became long, sharp, and firm.\nWerewolf Transformation!\nThis doll-like baneful entity became a huge werewolf. \"She\" kept moving at high speeds, waving \"Her\" sharp claws as \"She\" engaged in an intense battle with the hill-like Dark Demonic Wolf.\nAmidst the clashing sounds, Klein was attacked by Kotar's three remaining marionettes.\nOne of them raised his head and roared, causing brown short hair to tear through his clothes. In an instant, he transformed into a terrifying giant bear that was twice the height of a person. One crouched down, pressing his palms against the ground, while the other raised his right hand and yanked his hair.\nAt that moment, a crimson flame surged out of Klein's clothes, instantly devouring him.\nHis figure appeared in a sea of flames to the side. Then, he jumped out, raised his staff, and charged straight at the huge brown bear.\nAnd at the spot where he was originally standing, dark green mutated vines pierced through the ground and grew wildly, stirring the remnant flames in the middle.\nTap! Tap! Tap!\nThe huge brown bear didn't back down. With heavy strides, it rushed towards Klein like a high-speed steam locomotive. It spread open its arms, trying to give him a \"passionate\" hug that could crush all his bones and squeeze all his chest muscles together.\nTap! Tap! Tap!\nAs his black trench coat flailed to his back, Klein didn't retreat-he was about to collide with the huge brown bear.\nSuddenly, he kicked his left foot and twisted his waist. He forcefully jumped up and flew past the brown bear diagonally.\nThud!\nAs the two crossed each other, Klein swung his black staff down and ruthlessly struck the brown bear's shoulder.\nNormally, such an attack wouldn't have been able to hurt the thick hide of the brown bear. However, with the Staff of the Stars, the physical attack would lead to random abnormal changes or strange effects.\nOf course, under the God of Wishes's suppression, these changes and effects wouldn't exceed that of a Sequence 4 Beyonder power.\nThud!\nAs the sound of the staff's strike reverberated, the huge brown bear's shoulder tore open diagonally from its shoulder. The bottom half of its torso \"teleported\" more than ten meters away while the remaining portion remained in place.\nThe brown bear's internal organs and blood gushed to the ground in a rather shocking scene.\nHowever, the brown bear wasn't dead yet. Its two halves were squirming as it struggled to stabilize his center of mass and continued attacking.\nAs a marionette, he had long died. Such damage was nothing.\nAt this moment, Klein had already jumped behind the brown bear, his feet stepping on the ground.\nAnother wave of scarlet flames surged out, drowning his figure.\nA flame that was about to be extinguished rose up as Klein leaped out and arrived close to the marionette which had both hands on the ground.\nWith his silk top hat, he ran past the marionette without turning his head as he swung the staff to the side.\nThud!\nThe marionette's body burst into golden flames as his figure instantly vanished.\nA flame surged into the sky as the marionette jumped down. However, the golden flames didn't extinguish, quickly burning him to ashes.\nWithout even looking over, Klein had already rushed in front of the marionette that was yanking his hair.\nThe marionette immediately threw out the hair in his hand.\nThese strands of hair began to burn as they emitted black gases, sounding alarms to Klein's spirituality senses.\nPoison!\nAn unknown poison!\nWith a creak, he forcefully stopped using his ability as a Clown. Using the inertia of his body, he extended his black staff.\nAll sorts of thoughts rapidly reformed in his mind, quickly forming a scene.\nBefore this operation, Klein had requested Miss Justice's help to hypnotize him. It made his brain unable to form scenes when he subconsciously thought of one. There would only be a single thought resonating in his mind, and he had to take the initiative to control it to construct the scene. This allowed him to use the Staff of the Stars for a long time without being affected by the negative effects. As for the flaws of thinking in such a manner, Klein felt that it was still acceptable under predetermined conditions.\nWithout a sound, the gems embedded in the Staff of the Stars lit up. A pure white and holy pillar of light descended from the sky, enveloping the black gas and the corresponding marionette.\nThe poison quickly melted under the Sun's burning. It was the same with the marionette.\nWith a remnant glow still in his eyes, Klein instinctively turned around and aimed his staff at the brown bear that was split into two.\nSilver lightning flashed spontaneously before the separated brown bear's body finally collapsed, unable to get up again.\nIn just a few seconds, Klein had finished off the remaining marionettes of the Dark Demonic Wolf.\nAfter Sefirah Castle's anomaly, be it him or the God of Wishes, time became abnormally precious. No one was willing to stall for time, because it wouldn't be long before high-level existences like the True Creator and Angel of Time Amon in the Forsaken Land of the Gods descended.\nUpon seeing this, Dark Demonic Wolf Kotar trembled violently and flung out the translucent velvet curtain.\nThe curtain first vanished into thin air before it suddenly appeared behind Klein. Just as his spirituality was about to send a warning, it covered him and wrapped him within it!\nKlein's vision immediately darkened as he felt his thoughts turn sluggish. His Spirit Body Threads were being inoculated onto the \"curtain\" one thread at a time.\nHe attempted using \"Flaming Jump,\" softening his bones, and using the Staff of the Stars, but he was unable to succeed in such an abnormal state.\nThe black velvet curtain became tighter and tighter, revealing the corresponding marks of his eyes, nose, and mouth, as though it was squeezing out a brand new \"person.\"\nReinette Tinekerr immediately \"jumped\" and appeared on the translucent \"curtain,\" purging it from Klein's body and teleporting elsewhere.\nThe Dark Demonic Wolf seized the opportunity and raised \"His\" neck, letting out a roar.\nThe \"curtain\" stood up, as if it had become a cloak draped over an invisible person's body.\nA terrifying suction force was born, causing the Spirit Body Threads of Reinette Tinekerr and Klein to uncontrollably float over.\nIf they didn't have the corresponding Beyonder powers, their Spirit Body Threads would've merged into the \"cloak\" in just three to four seconds, while they would become its marionettes.\nFortunately, Klein was a Marionettist himself. He immediately focused his attention and controlled his and Miss Messenger's Spirit Body Threads. He followed the method that he learned from Zaratul, allowing them to circle around him and return to their original positions, forming loops.\nRoar!\nThe Dark Demonic Wolf spat out a gas ball, sending it flying towards Klein like a cannonball.\nAs he was focused on controlling his and Miss Messenger's Spirit Body Threads, Klein could barely duck. Just as he was about to be struck, Reinette Tinekerr floated over and stood in front of him.\nBoom!\nReinette Tinekerr's blonde hair scattered as the evil vines wrapped around \"Her\" body broke apart.\nThe Dark Demonic Wolf's follow-up actions were one smooth continuous series of actions. Taking advantage of the moment when the \"curtain\" was desperately pulling at its target's Spirit Body Threads, \"He\" launched repeated attacks on Klein, forcing Reinette Tinekerr to block them. It caused the tough Ancient Bane to tremble under the attack of \"His\" claws, air blobs, and flaming attacks. More and more wounds appeared, making it look like \"She\" could not last any longer.\nAt this critical moment, as Klein controlled the Spirit Body Threads to resist the attraction of the \"curtain,\" he reached into his pocket and took out another iron cigar case.\nThe seal was removed and the box was opened. Inside, there was also a gold coin lying quietly. There was also a Wraith on the surface of the gold coin.\nThis was a blurry female wraith, a true undying creature, and not a Wraith from the Mutant pathway.\nIt was the strongest trump card that Klein had prepared. Previously, because he was inside the isolated \"kingdom\" that wasn't connected to the outside world. He was afraid that he wouldn't be able to obtain the desired effect. Only when the \"curtain\" targeted him and Miss Messenger did he feel that the opportunity was here.\nAs the box was opened, the wraith suddenly jumped onto the surface of a glass fragment. On it were nearly illusory black tubes that extended into infinity, connecting to the unknown.\nThis was the symbol of Artificial Death.\nAnd Artificial Death was equivalent to the Evernight Goddess!\nThis trump card of his was the reenactment of the time when the Evernight Goddess had used God of Glory Bladel's corpse to foil Amon's attempt to snatch Sefirah Castle.\nFor this, he deliberately found a wraith-like monster in the Forsaken Land of the Gods and imprisoned it, placing it together with the Artificial Death project's white feathers he summoned from the fog of history.\nThrough his repeated experiments and prayers during his specific trips to Backlund, this Wraith had finally established a certain connection with Artificial Death, allowing the Evernight Goddess to use this opportunity to exert a rather low level of influence!","1":"The boundless gray fog boiled as the ancient and majestic palace burned.\nThe blazing flames condensed into a fiery blob, as though a blinding sun had risen out from this mysterious space.\nA howling hurricane flipped the long mottled table, snapping the thick stone columns and causing half the palace to collapse.\nSitting at The Fool's seat, Klein's brain was boiling before holes exploded out of it. Charred maggots then began crawling out of the cracks.\nHe didn't die, and he had even very calmly reached out his right palm and tapped the armrest of the chair.\nAbove the gray fog, this mysterious space quaked in an obvious manner. Waves of power surged out one after another, calming the hurricane and extinguishing the flames. The blazing sun evaporated, inch by inch.\nThe thick stone pillars stood once more as the long mottled table returned to its original state. The magnificent and holy palace appeared as though it had never collapsed or suffered any damage.\nKlein's head recovered instantly, and the charred maggots that had drilled out had turned transparent again before crawling back inside.\nAs expected, stronger than Dragon of Imagination Ankewelt... Klein muttered to himself as his expression couldn't help but warp. He couldn't help but massage his forehead. It's painful... This pain is also clearly stronger...\nWhile muttering, he rapped the edge of the long mottled table and made the mysterious space above the gray fog quake once more.\nAmidst the quakes, a pitch-black shadow abruptly emerged out of the palace's floor.\nThis shadow twisted and struggled before being wiped clean by the gray fog's powers, leaving nothing behind.\nAfter nearly a minute, Klein calmed down completely and recalled the scene he had seen.\nThat should be the ancient sun god, the City of Silver Creator, Adam's and Amon's dad...\nFrom the crucifix \"He\" wore, and that line, \"Let there be light,\" there's a high chance that \"He\" is the first transmigrator. Perhaps he's Caucasian with a religious background...\n\"He\" used a language that can stir the powers of nature. It's similar to Jotun, but it's also different. It doesn't belong to Elvish, Dragonese, and ancient Hermes... Yes, it has similarities with the ancient Feysac of the Northern Continent and the Dutanese of the Southern Continent. This allowed me to barely understand what \"He\" was saying despite me not knowing this language... This is the language \"He\" learned from that strange giant building?\n\"He\" transmigrated there and inherited a rich inheritance?\nThe second scene was of \"Him\" suffering a betrayal, the scene of him being eaten by the Kings of Angels, White, Wisdom, and Wind?\nTo a deity who claims to be a Creator, that kind of corporeal pain and that distortion can only appear in such a situation...\nYes, the divine blood \"He\" dripped before \"His\" death fused with the silver crucifix, and it later turned into the latter's form, becoming a rather powerful Sealed Artifact.\nFrom the looks of it, the Unshadowed Crucifix was obtained by one of the three Kings of Angels, or it landed in Amon's or Adam's hands. To \"Them,\" this is an important item \"Their\" father left behind.\nThe previous possibility isn't too high. The cross's effects are extremely useful. Furthermore, its origins are a secret that needs to be kept. No one would give it to the Augustus family... From the looks of it, was it really arranged by Adam?\nWhy did \"He\" give the Unshadowed Crucifix to Miss Magician and Miss Judgment in a very reasonable manner?\n\"He\" had discovered that the two ladies believe in The Fool after observing them for some time?\nThis cross was meant for The Fool that doesn't belong to this era?\n\"He\" wishes to know where \"His\" father, who also doesn't belong to that era, came from? But the problem is how does \"He\" plan on raising that question and obtaining an answer?\nThat City of Silver's Creator's level is extremely high. \"He\" was able to sense my prying despite the long stretch of history between us. He cast his gaze above the gray fog and cast it on this mysterious space. Furthermore, the influence \"He\" created not only openly caused destruction but also secretly invaded this place, creating a special shadow. It nearly lurked here, hidden...\nDoesn't this mean that, once one obtains the authorities of several domains, a deity's level will also undergo a qualitative change?\nWhat does the uttering of \"Mysteries\" mean? Is it pointing to me, or the original owner of this mysterious space?\nQuestions flashed past Klein's mind, making him come up with several theories, but the final answer eluded him.\nDue to his fear of Adam, he believed that the best outcome for the Unshadowed Crucifix was to have the City of Silver's god-like Sealed Artifact shatter it and reform it into a pure Beyonder characteristic.\nReining in his thoughts and suppressing his questions, Klein conjured a new pen and paper and wrote down the knowledge he had learned from looking straight at the City of Silver Creator: \"Sequence 4: Unshadowed\n\"Main ingredients: One drop of the Sun's divine blood, or three adult Sun Divine Bird's feathers and a piece of Holy Brilliance Rock.\n\"Supplementary ingredients: 60ml of Sun Divine Bird's blood, 30 ml of Holy Brilliance Rock liquid. 7 drops of mutated fingered citron juice, 10 grams worth of powder of the heart of magma.\n\"Ritual: Extract the strongest emotions that one is most unwilling to abandon before consuming the potion. Inject these emotions back again during this process.\"\n\"Sequence 3: Justice Mentor...\n\"Sequence 4: Black Knight...\n\"Sequence 3: Trinity Templar...\"\nAfter doing all of this, Klein picked up the bronze cross again and observed it with a heavy expression.\nHe then threw Unshadowed Crucifix into the junk pile and stirred the powers of the mysterious space above the gray fog to suppress it. He didn't wish to see the paper figurines he cut begin to praise the Sun the next time he came.\nIn front of an ordinary house in Cherwood Borough.\nA postman riding a bike braked and stopped at the door.\nHe then settled down his bike and took out a letter from his bag, glancing to check if the address was correct.\n\"It's here... For Xio...\" The postman briskly walked to the mailbox and threw the letter in. Following that, he didn't delay as he got on his bike and kicked off.\nAfter a while, a pitch-black flame suddenly spewed out of the mailbox's mouth.\nThis flame burned quietly and quickly disappeared.\nIn Empress Borough, the opulent villa of Earl Hall.\nAudrey, who had brought Susie to the garden for a stroll, had just returned to the foyer when she saw her father, Earl Hall, come in from the outside. He had his brows knitted, seemingly in deep thought.\n\"Father, did something happen?\" Audrey asked with concern.\nThis was the most basic of observations which she didn't need to hide at all.\nEarl Hall restrained his frustrated expression and said with a smile, \"It's nothing important. I just never expected Hvin Rambis to be a member of a cult.\"\n\"He\u2018s a member of a cult?\" Audrey expressed her surprise appropriately.\nShe knew that Hvin Rambis was actually a member of the upper echelons of a secret organization known as the Psychology Alchemists, but she didn't understand how this was suddenly exposed.\nEarl Hall nodded solemnly.\n\"Yes, he's wanted by the three Churches. I'm still not sure which cult he's involved in.\"\n\"...Has he been caught?\" Audrey's eyes darted around as she asked \"curiously.\"\n__No, he disappeared before the warrant was issued.\" Earl sighed. __It_s really hard to imagine that he_s a cult member. He's of excellent character and is knowledgeable. He's rational and objective in various matters and is filled with wisdom.\"\nThat's just the side he wants you to see... Audrey inwardly mumbled. Then, as usual, she entered the small prayer room at home before dinner. She faced the Sacred Emblem of the Evernight Goddess and got into a prayer gesture.\nHowever, her low chanting was:\n\"The Fool that doesn't belong to this era...\"\nAfter chanting the honorific name, Audrey succinctly reported:\n\"Hvin Rambis has gone missing.\n\"He has been identified as a cultist and is wanted by all three Churches...\"\nWith that said, Audrey was about to solemnly pray to the Goddess when a boundless gray fog appeared before her.\nIn the middle of the grayish-white fog, a blurry figure sat on the chair, looking down from above and gently nodded. \"I'm aware.\"\nJust as this secret existence said that, the scene before Audrey's eyes changed suddenly. It presented a figure who was concentrating on praying.\n\"Honorable Mr. Fool, the Church of Evernight has obtained intelligence from Qonas Kilgor and confirmed that King George III hides an extremely huge secret. For the obtaining of a Blood Emperor ruins in the Sterlewen segment of the Tussock River, he colluded with the Demoness Sect and Psychology Alchemists to partake in human trafficking, creating the human disappearance cases that ultimately led to the Great Smog of Backlund...\n\"The Demoness Sect's former representative was Despair Nightingale Panatiya and was later changed to Saintess of White Katarina. For the Psychology Alchemists, it's Hvin Rambis...\n\"Please remind Miss Justice to be careful when she meets Hvin Rambis again. She needs to be constantly prepared to seek help.\"\nHis Majesty... Audrey's eyes widened as upheavals went through her heart. She found it difficult to control herself.\nThis was partly due to the fact that this news was shocking for a noble like her. In addition, it had to do with Lie which magnified her emotions.\nAlmost at the same time, a news report flashed in Audrey's mind. It was one that had left an unerasable impression on her:\n\"...According to preliminary estimates, a total of over 21,000 people died in the smog, and the subsequent plague took the lives of close to 40,000 people. Among the deceased were young children, healthy young men, and women...\"\nSo that's how it is... What is the king plotting... The three Churches likely don't have any actual evidence; otherwise, Father wouldn't only be frustrated to this degree... Audrey felt an inexplicable sense of anger and sadness. It felt like particular principles she had upheld in the past had been ruthlessly trampled, or that values that had stood up to time were silently crumbling.\nShe subconsciously lowered her head and closed her eyes.\nThen, she exhaled and whispered, \"Thank you, Mr. Fool. Please convey my gratitude to Mr. World.\"\nAfter her prayer, Audrey sat in the tranquil darkness and didn't move for a long time.","2":"The smell of canned wolf-fish is really pungent... Not only is it smelly, but it's also disgusting... It's practically a biological weapon!Klein crouched in the corner and took nearly a minute to recover.\nBefore that very instant, he had underestimated canned wolf-fish. He had failed to take the necessary actions to deal with the situation. He could've used Paper Figurine Substitutes or create an invisible air tube to pretend that he was using Underwater Breathing, but he had done none of that.\nNow, he finally got a deep understanding of how wise it was to ban opening canned wolf-fish in public!\nPhew...Klein exhaled as he slowly stood up. Carrying his suitcase, he slowly walked towards the harbor.\nHis first impression of the city named Nas was one of many white houses, with stone being a common material for the buildings. The second impression was that it wasn't too far north, but the temperature was rather cold. Even though it was already April, it was still only a few degrees Celsius. The third impression was that there were many whaling houses. Gigantic beluga whales were being dismembered for their skin, flesh, fat, bones, and \"gray amber.\"\nThe latter two could be used to make pannier for banquet dresses or top-grade scented materials. Whether it was for incense or perfume, they were considered luxurious goods that only the wealthy and nobles could enjoy.\nAs for the skin, flesh, and fat of beluga whales, they also had their own uses. They were used separately to make clothes, food, or oil-related products. In Nas and the Gargas Archipelago, the culinary methods for preparing beluga whale had transformed into a unique culture. There were all sorts of techniques and famous restaurants.\nKlein passed by the various whaling houses, seeing separated fat being carried out on cargo carriages towards nearby factories that spewed black smoke. They were oil refineries which were very unique to Gargas. Beluga whale fat could be refined into whale oil which could be bottled and made into outstanding incendiary material and the lifeblood of particular industries.\nVery unique...Klein exhaled some mist as he stopped and watched for a while.\nOut of the harbor and into the city district, a cacophony of Feysac inundated his ears.\nHaving mastered ancient Feysac-the source of the Northern Continent's language-Klein was long familiar with the language of the Northern Continent barbarians. He turned his head upon hearing the din and saw the tall populace with slightly blonde hair raising horizontal banners as they protested on the streets.\nThe horizontal banner right at the front clearly wrote the reasons for their protest.\n\"Oppose the poaching of beluga whales! We need sustainable development!\"\nPfft...Klein nearly lost his cool as he believed that the concept of \"sustainable development\" was highly likely to be \"invented\" by Emperor Roselle.\nAs he swept his gaze, he looked at the banners behind it and understood the goals of the protest.\n\"Whaling for survival, not entertainment!\"\n\"Humans aren't more important than beluga whales!\"\n\"Greedy devils should leave Nas!\"\nAt this moment, a policeman dressed in a gray uniform held a shield, riot fork, and baton to stop the protesters from advancing.\nAfter a brief argument, the scene quickly turned violent.\nMany protesting youths threw opened canned wolf-fish, as well as Molotov cocktails. The police didn't show restraint as they forged forward, raising their shields and striking with their batons.\nKlein pinched his nose as he watched the fire burning on the street. He realized that many passersby were completely unfazed. Apart from a small bunch of spectators, the rest continued proceeding to their destinations.\nIt appears that such things happen often in Nas... Do protests develop into riots? As expected of the Feysac Empire...Klein mumbled to himself, circled the street, and casually found an inn to stay.\nHe continued registering as Gehrman Sparrow, unworried that the news released by Vice Admiral Ailment Tracy would cause the Church of the Evernight Goddess to view him as a Faceless. This was because he had no plans on traveling through the whale fishing routes to find mermaids who were believers of the Goddess. He planned on heading to the dangerous region farthest east from the Sonia Sea.\nAs for the safety in the Gargas Archipelago, there was nothing he needed to worry about. This was a colony of the Feysac Empire. The only legal Church was the Church of the God of Combat. They were enemies with the Church of the Evernight Goddess.\nKlein was originally worried that he would encounter many Faceless here, meeting seven or eight Faceless simply from going next door to enjoy some whale cuisine. However, after serious consideration, he rationally eliminated this possibility.\nFirst, Beyonders from the Seer pathway were rare to begin with. Klein had only met three Beyonders who were beyond Sequence 8, and second, Sequence 6 Beyonders weren't commonly seen. Even in a playground for pirates, those who had 5,000-pound bounties were considered rare creatures. Third, once a Faceless had many preparations, they would seek out mermaids on a whaling boat. They would either begin having faith in the Goddess, sink to the bottom of the ocean, or become research personnel. Otherwise, the extremely smart ones would seize the opportunity and successfully advance before leaving safely. It was very rare for them to stay on Gargas Archipelago for long.\nIn all of Nas, excluding myself, there wouldn't be more than two Faceless...Klein straightened his clothes as he wasn't in a rush to contact Admiral of Stars Cattleya. He came onto the streets in a good mood and began searching for delicacies according to what he heard on his travels.\nRaw beluga whale slices, fried whale steak, whale oil with skin, roasted whale meat...Like a standard traveler, Klein restaurant hopped thrice and sampled different food.\nNot bad. It's pretty unique and it's not very fishy. Instead, it's very appetizing and alluring... Burp...Klein covered his mouth as he came onto the streets. He discovered that the street lamps were sparse, but the lights from the houses lining the streets were bright. To a certain extent, they reduced the darkness of the night.\nIce-cold winds passed through the ocean, causing Klein to raise his hand to prop up his collar. The blue cufflinks had their lusters restrained as they were deeply embedded at his wrists.\nCompared to rings, items like cufflinks were more suited to Gehrman Sparrow's persona. Therefore, Klein didn't blame the Artisan for making changes without his permission.\nAs for the harmonica that had fixed the summoning ritual of a spirit world creature, it matched Klein's inward intentions completely. It could be used for a year and a half. It was silver in color, exquisite and beautiful.\nWhen he received the harmonica, Klein had imagined such a scene-a crazy and powerful adventurer playing a sad tune on the harmonica in a silent night under the dark moonlight by the side of a boat.\nUnfortunately, the harmonica couldn't produce any sound, and it could only be used to summon Reinette Tinekerr.\nShaking his head indiscernibly, Klein steadily walked down the empty and cold Nas streets before returning to his inn.\nUsing sleep to bring himself back to an optimal state, he went to Gray Amber Street the next morning and entered a sundry store named Hot Whale Dance.\nUpon seeing the grizzled boss who was a head taller than him, Klein tapped the counter and said in Feysac, \"Whale oil.\"\nThe boss had wrinkles plastered across his face, but he only wore a coat made of beluga whale skin. The light-colored patterns had a strange beauty.\n\"How much?\" The boss was drinking large mouthfuls of liquor, ignoring the messy placement of the goods.\n\"One and a quarter buckets,\" Klein replied according to the predetermined secret password.\nThe boss's drinking actions instantly slowed down as he placed the cup of brownish-green alcohol onto the bar counter.\n\"Do you want to try some? It's many times purer than Nepos. It's considered the mistress of all Feysac men.\"\nThis was a distilled liquor that's a specialty of Feysac. It's brewed with potatoes or grain. The alcohol purity was high, as stimulating and famous as Blaze. Compared to Sonia blood wine, its price was rather low, and it was well-liked by ordinary Feysacians.\n\"There's no need.\" Klein shook his head.\nThe boss chuckled.\n\"What kind of man are you if you don't drink Nepos?\n\"Are there only women in Loen?\"\nHe mumbled before drinking another mouthful.\n\"Who introduced you here?\"\n\"Ma'am Gehrmuses,\" Klein said a name in the style of the local customs.\nThe boss exhaled, causing a strong scent of distilled liquor to linger in the air.\nHe staggered as he got up, like a polar bear performing at a circus.\nAfter giving the store employee instructions, he brought Klein to a tiny room on the second story of the warehouse at the back.\n\"Let me search for it. Let's see...\" the boss mumbled as he crouched.\nKlein controlled the twitching of his facial muscles as he recalled a widely-spread joke in the Loen Kingdom.\n\"When is a Feysac man not drunk? When he's in his mother's womb.\"\nAfter waiting for a moment, Klein saw the boss find a pure crystal ball from his rummaging.\nThen, the tipsy \"polar bear\" had his back facing Klein as he rubbed his hands on it, softly chanting the tongue-twisting ancient Hermes.\nThe room gradually turned dark as all the corners without light sank like they were producing a strange attractive force.\nThe crystal ball quickly lit up, producing the figure of a woman wearing a black, classic robe.\nShe had an oval face and had very fair skin. Her eyes were deep black with a slight purple hue which was filled with mystery.\nI'm seeing another Tarot Club member's actual appearance again...Klein stepped forward and received the crystal ball.\nOn the opposite end of the crystal ball, The Hermit Cattleya could also clearly see The World. He had black hair and brown eyes, with a thin and angular face.\nHer gaze paused for a moment before she hesitantly said, \"Gehrman Sparrow?\"\nShe discovered that the true strength and standards of the Tarot Club members were far stronger than she had expected. The World was actually the crazy hunter, Gehrman Sparrow, who was considered at the level of a pirate admiral!\nMy various assumptions of The World were problematic... Controlled, staid, experienced, and ruthless...Admiral of Stars didn't feel overly surprised.\n\"Yes, Ma'am Cattleya.\" Klein gestured for the boss to leave the room.\nAfter it became extremely quiet, Admiral of Stars Cattleya asked once again, \"I'm very curious. How did you recognize my identity? I've been very careful when participating in the gatherings.\"\nOf course, she had jumped in fright when The World, who had chosen to speak privately with her, immediately greeted her with \"Admiral of Stars.\"\nAnd it was partly because of this that she chose to take on The World's commission.\n\"A secret.\" Klein smiled politely.\nAs he didn't wish for her to make connections to Mr. Fool, he calmly added, \"Your eyes are very special.\"\n\"Can I understand that as a form of praise?\" Cattleya smiled, feeling somewhat enlightened.\nShe believed that The World had previously only relied on her eyes and other details to suspect that she was Admiral of Stars, but she wasn't certain. Hence, he had probed her with language, and her reaction told him the correct answer.\nKlein didn't respond as he switched to asking, \"When can we set off?\"","3":"After hearing Macht's reply, and combining what he knew, Klein guessed that the rat in the manor was likely the Marauder demigod which had been by Hazel's side. As for why it went rabid and bit Hazel, he was unsure.\nHe nodded slightly and tapped his chest four times in a clockwise fashion.\n\"May the Goddess bless her.\"\nAfter saying that, he walked past the host, entered the hall, and waited for the ball tonight to begin.\nIn a particular bedroom on the third story, Hazel was sitting on a reclining chair feeling dispirited, her feet curled up.\nHer left hand was wrapped in thick bandages, but there weren't any more signs of blood. Her expression was heavy, nothing like her usual arrogance.\nIn the manor, her teacher, that was in the form of a rat, had suddenly bitten her. This resulted in her being stuck in a similar state, her entire being turbid and muddled. It was as though it wasn't her hand that was bitten but her heart.\nTo Hazel, although her arrogance stemmed from her upbringing, with her ability to absorb new information exceeding that of the average person's, her outstanding looks, her family's standing in high society, and her maturity compared to her peers, those feelings were still within normal boundaries before she gained extraordinary powers. None of the aforementioned traits made her feel that she was different from others or that she was fundamentally superior to ordinary people.\nTherefore, with her teacher, who maintained her sense of arrogance while being a representation of her fortuitous encounter and the source of her strength, suddenly becoming a real rat-to the point of not being able to speak clearly and even bite her without any reason-it left a deep impact on her. She began to question if supernatural powers represented being extraordinary or a monster.\nAmidst her thoughts, Hazel subconsciously pulled her black-green hair to the back of her ear and felt frustrated with the melody that came from downstairs.\nAt this moment, she heard the creaking sound of the door as she turned her head in hesitation.\nWalking in was a gray rat with slick fur. Its eyes were deeper than its kind, closer to dark red.\n\"Hazel,\" the rat said in a deep voice.\nHazel was first taken aback before she reeled in delight. She hurriedly stood up and blurted, \"Teacher, y-you've recovered?\"\nJust as she said that, she saw gray rats crawling out from the corner of her bedroom, balcony, and bed. All of them had dark red eyes but could only produce squeaking sounds.\nHazel took a step back in shock, overturning the reclining chair. Her body staggered, almost to the point of collapsing. It took her a great deal of effort to recover her balance.\nAt this moment, she discovered that the red-eyed rats had vanished. The door had been shut tightly, having never opened.\nEverything that had happened was a hallucination or a nightmare that stemmed from the worries inside her!\nAfter a moment of silence, Hazel pursed her lips and sighed.\nShe sat back down, raising her hand to her temples.\nAs she massaged her temples, she frowned slightly. She had a nagging feeling that what had happened was too surreal.\nHer dark brown eyes darted about slightly as Hazel removed the necklace she wore around her neck, clenching it in her palm.\nThe necklace's seven green gems were equidistant from each other. Embedded around them were tiny diamonds.\nAt this moment, one of the gems lit up slowly, emitting a green glow, giving her face a sheen and filling her eyes with mysterious symbols.\nThe scenes from before surfaces in the girl's mind as her blurry dream-like state gradually turned clear.\nWhile observing the scenes, Hazel sensed something amiss. She confirmed that she hadn't been dreaming, nor was it a short hallucination from having her mind go adrift. Instead, she had been thrown into an illusion for nearly ten seconds.\nCryptologist!\nThis... Hazel's dark brown eyes widened as she muttered a word filled with horror.\nShe jumped to her feet and looked around anxiously but failed to discover anything.\nBut the more she looked, the more terrified she became. She had no idea what she would encounter next, nor did she understand what the person who created the dream was up to!\nThe only thing she was certain of was that the other party's level and strength in the supernatural domain far exceeded hers!\nThis shattered what little pride she had left.\nAfter a few minutes, the entire bedroom remained silent. The brisk melody from downstairs instantly connected oneself to the current dance steps.\nHazel finally composed herself, believing that nothing would happen next.\nOnly then did she have the mood or energy to consider the motives of the person who secretly cast the illusion.\nAs various thoughts surfaced in her mind, Hazel suddenly came up with a theory:\nThe person from before was here for her teacher!\nThrough the illusion, the person had confirmed her teacher's current situation!\nIs it Teacher's friend, or an enemy? He's definitely headed off to look for Teacher. What do I do? He likely doesn't know where Teacher is hiding... No, all my neighbors know that I was bitten by a rabid rat... Hazel was thrown into panic as she clenched her necklace with increasing strength.\nShe couldn't be sure of the motives of the other party, nor did she know what she could do.\nShe wished to head to the manor and inform her teacher, but she was afraid of encountering danger and end up being sacrificed.\nFurthermore, her teacher had seemingly lost the ability to communicate. Her warnings might not necessarily be conveyed.\nWithout realizing it, Hazel stood up and paced about in her bedroom. Finally, she made up her mind. Pursing her lips tightly, she walked to the door and said to her lady's maid outside, \"I'm a little tired. I plan on sleeping now. Don't let anyone disturb me.\"\n\"Yes, my lady,\" the maid immediately replied.\nAfter closing the door, Hazel began changing into clothes that allowed for greater movement. Her expression was extremely heavy as her teeth bit down on her lip.\nShe had finally decided to warn her teacher at the manor.\nShe didn't wish to become a seemingly arrogant person but, in actuality, was a coward, one who would abandon all principles upon encountering danger!\nShe found it despicable of herself!\nWhile the bodyguards were focusing their attention on the ball's attendees, Hazel took the opportunity to enter the garden using a water pipe from the balcony. When leaving 39 B\u00f6klund Street, Klein was holding onto a cup of sweet and iced fizzy wine, discussing business in the Southern Continent with a few gentlemen.\nHe turned his head slightly, glancing at the garden. He had already noticed Hazel's actions thanks to his intuition.\n...Although she's not a likable girl, she has quite a kind heart... Klein nodded indiscernibly and praised her inwardly.\nHe wasn't worried about Hazel's actions, because to go from North Borough's B\u00f6klund Street to Macht's manor in Backlund's northwestern suburbs would take three to five hours on carriage. And before she arrived, he would've already used an excuse to leave the ball, teleporting over directly to confirm the situation.\nAlthough Macht's manor was in the northwestern suburbs, it was on the other side of the Tussock River. Hence, to head there, one needed to take a detour to an area with a bridge. It was fine in the day, as one could use the steam metro to head to the south side of the Bridge beneath the river. At night, there were only three bridges to consider. It was inevitable to spend five hours traveling.\nOf course, as Klein had used Tinder before and had read 2-105 Blood Vessel Thief's information, he had some idea about the powers of the Marauder pathway. Therefore, he suspected that Hazel, who had an item of a higher level, could \"steal\" the flight abilities of birds and use that short period of time to cross the river. This way, she might arrive within three hours.\nRegardless, I'll be faster than her... Klein retracted his gaze and began considering who his next dance partner should be.\nTen in the evening, Moose Manor in the northwestern suburbs of Backlund.\nThis place originally belonged to a viscount, and it had more than a hundred years of history. Macht had bought it after his marriage, spending tons of money to maintain it every year so as to invite friends over during winter weekends for a vacation.\nAt this moment, the land steward was arranging for the servants to check every corner and to lock all the windows and doors. This was a necessary procedure before they slept every night.\nA few maids walked out of the wine cellar in a group, heading straight for the kitchen to ensure that all flames had been extinguished.\nThe moment they arrived, they heard squeaking sounds as they looked over, only to discover a grayish-white rat gnawing on a table leg.\nThis rat seemed to sense their gaze, but it didn't run. Instead, it turned its head and glared at them with its slightly red eyes.\nMeanwhile, there were more squeaking sounds as red-eyed rats ran out from the roof beams, storage cabinets, and all kinds of miscellaneous, even appearing beside the furnace which had some water boiling over it.\nThe maids nearly screamed in fear.\nAs members of the lowest classes of society, they were no strangers to rats. They had even killed quite a number. However, it was their first time to encounter so many at once. They couldn't help but feel a heavy blow to their senses.\n\"We need to get Guede and the others to deal with this,\" a maid left the kitchen and suggested in fear.\nAnother maid nodded immediately.\n\"Miss Hazel was bitten by a rabid rat... These don't look normal in any way!\"\nAs they spoke, they retreated a great distance back, distancing themselves from the kitchen.\nAt this moment, a figure quickly appeared on the table. He wore a white shirt and black vest under a dark-colored formal suit. On his head was a half top hat, and he had a pair of bright leather boots.\nThis figure slowly lifted his head while holding down his hat. He surveyed the surroundings, revealing his black hair and brown eyes. He had a thin face and cut features. He was none other than Gehrman Sparrow.\nHaving left the ball ahead of time, Klein returned to Dwayne Dant\u00e8s's residence and entered his bedroom. Then, he teleported over with Winner Enuni.\nOf course, the latter had been left outside the manor to allow for any instantaneous switches in positions.\nThe rats reflected into his eyes as Klein pulled the human-skinned glove on his left hand, casting his gaze towards the flowerbed in the manor.\nAlmost at the same time, the rats in the kitchen stirred as their movements turned sluggish. However, they quickly returned to normal.\nThey had become a Bizarro Sorcerer's marionettes.\nAnd Klein could control as many as 50 marionettes, a number that would rise once he finished digesting the potion!","4":"Beyond the window, the glass greenhouse reflected the pale light of the sun, and the bright roses stood out even in the thin fog.\nIn the bedroom, Duke Negan seemed to have recovered the feeling of following his father and elders around the vast lands when he was young, riding a horse, using a hound, and chasing a wild beast.\nFinally, he climaxed and the surroundings seemed to become abnormally quiet.\nAt this moment, his mind suddenly buzzed once. He felt as if the pleasure and comfort he was feeling had suddenly exploded one after another. It continued exploding without end or limit, again and again.\nDuke Negan's waist kept shaking, and his eyes were blank, his brain having lost its train of thought.\nHis heart began to beat violently in an unbearable manner, like a steam boiler whose pressure had gone beyond its limits. It could blow up at any time, and hot steam could gush out at any moment.\nIf it were an ordinary person or a Beyonder who wasn't physically strong, they would've suffered a heart attack, a massive cerebral hemorrhage, and die on the spot. But Duke Negan ultimately managed to ride through the attack. Only his eyes were unfocused, and saliva was flowing out the corner of his mouth before he weakly slumped onto his mistress.\nThe Wind-blessed and the duke's secretary, who were onguard on both sides of the room, simultaneously sensed the strange and mysterious smell of spirituality. The former's body was suddenly surrounded by a violent wind, sweeping him towards the wall, and with a clang, a large hole was blown through the wall as he stepped into the bedroom.\nThe secretary went straight to the source of the mystery-the attic of the house!\nAlong the way, he didn't evade or dodge, but the decorative vases and other objects in the corridor seemed to have found lives of their own and avoided him in ingenious ways.\nAs he ran up the stairs to the attic, the wooden floorboards seemed to rise, as if to give him a hand.\nIn just three or four seconds, the refined, handsome, blond young man entered the attic and saw a figure sitting on an old chair.\nThe figure was covered in a thick black liquid, just like the gathering of all the ugly desires and intense feelings in the depths of a human's heart. It was the greed of willing to sell and hang oneself by the ropes, the hunger that wouldn't even spare one's own kind, and a lust without limits.\nThis was a devil walking the earth!\nThe skinny secretary's expression didn't change, nor did he attack directly. Instead, he looked at the other party, reached behind him, and politely closed the door.\nBam!\nThe wooden door of the attic was closed.\nThe entire room suddenly felt like it had been completely sealed, as if one could never leave the room unless effort was put in to crack the seal.\nAt this moment, the concept of \"closing the door and sealing the room\" seemed to have been changed to \"seal this place, isolate the outside from the inside!\"\nThe Desire Apostle moved. His body expanded and grew a pair of huge bat wings that emitted light blue tongues of flames.\nOne by one, fireballs that exuded a strong sulfurous smell were formed, and they bombarded Duke Negan's blond secretary.\nThe secretary reached out with his white-gloved left hand and clenched it while half-turning his wrist.\nBoom! Boom! Boom!\nThe fireballs stopped following the principle of straight or parabolic paths as they scattered in every direction in a sudden outburst of chaos, like the irregular movement of tiny particles suggested by a\u00a0botanist1. Some of them hit the wall, some hit the ceiling, some fell beside the weak-looking secretary, and some fell backward, almost wounding the Desire Apostle himself.\nThe entire attic was a mess, with traces of destruction and char everywhere, and the house even shook a few times.\nHowever, the mysterious power that was \"sealed\" in here, or the rules that had been tampered with, had yet been destroyed. The surrounding walls, the old wooden door, and the dusty roof appeared to be on the verge of collapsing, but it remained intact.\nThe Desire Apostle wasn't frustrated by the failure of his previous attempt, nor was he flustered that he couldn't control his enemy or catalyze him into a frenzy, due to his calmness and restrained desires. His coffee-brown eyes suddenly lit up like lava as he took the form of the blond secretary. He spat out a word in the Devil language, one filled with foulness and filth: \"Die!\"\nAlmost at the same time, the pupils under the secretary's golden-rimmed glasses constricted. He opened his left fist and aimed at the Desire Apostle with the palm of his hand.\nSuddenly, his figure split into two. One was refined and skinny like his actual self. The other was a shadow covered by a black liquid of \"desire.\" The two quickly alternated, overlapping with each other at times.\n\"Die!\"\nThe words said in the Language of Foulness echoed in the attic as the secretary let out a low grunt and took two steps back.\nFollowing that, the split silhouette dissipated, and large swaths of rusted red marks appeared on his face, as though he had turned into a man of iron that had been left in a humid area for years.\nCough! Cough! Cough!He coughed violently, spitting out blobs of rusted blood that had congealed into clumps.\nThe marks on his body began to slowly peel off.\nCough! Cough! Cough!\nThe Desire Apostle was also coughing, coughing out blood that had clumped and turned to rust. The viscous black liquid covering his entire body suddenly became much thinner.\nThe Language of Foulness seemed to have half of its effects transferred to him by Duke Negan's secretary!\n...\nIn the bedroom.\nThe Wind-blessed helped Duke Negan up and kicked the beautiful mistress to the other side in case she was an accomplice of the assailant.\nThe reason why he didn't help the secretary was because he knew he had only one responsibility-to protect Duke Negan!\nAnd in similar situations, one had to be wary of more than one enemy!\nAt this point, Duke Negan had somewhat recovered a little, he was rather strong, but his limbs still felt weak. His body felt empty and his mind was sluggish. He was completely unable to use his Beyonder powers.\nHe motioned to the Wind-blessed to remove the conch necklace from his neck and brought the item to his lips.\nDuke Negan took a deep breath and blew into the small conch which was covered in strange patterns.\nSplash!\nThe low and deep sound of the tide was heard as it rushed towards the Holy Wind Cathedral.\n\"With His Grace's speed, he should be able to arrive very soon!\" The Wind-blessed first reassured him, and then with Duke Negan on his back, he went to the window and leaped down.\nHe wanted to meet up with the duke's guards outside; there were two or three Low-Sequence Beyonders among them.\nDuke Negan gasped for breath and said, \"Catch him, make sure to catch him alive, or with a Spirit Body...\n\"I want to know who it is!\"\nHe had suffered an assassination attempt from Pirate Admiral Qilangos the last time, and now, it was an unknown Sequence 5 expert. Duke Negan was very aware that he hadn't developed any irredeemable grudges with anyone recently, as such, he was especially angry and resentful.\nHe wanted to find the mastermind and use all the resources at his disposal to tear the mastermind apart!\nThe premise of all this was that he could find clues from the assassin.\nSeven or eight seconds later, most of the duke's guards surged forward, surrounding Pallas Negan and the Wind-blessed in the middle as they gathered in front of the garden.\n\"Wait here and be on guard against the enemy,\" the Wind-blessed gave the order.\nUnder normal circumstances, he had to protect the duke and evacuate from the assassination grounds as quickly as possible and rush to the safety of the Holy Wind Cathedral. However, he wasn't sure if there were any other enemies, and he was afraid of being ambushed en route. He was afraid of missing the reinforcements from Spellsinger of God, Ace Snake, and ending up being placed in a more perilous situation.\nOne second, two seconds, three seconds... Time kept flowing by as the house shook from time to time, and the battle inside seemed to have reached its climax.\n\"Why is the Archbishop not here yet?\" the panting Duke Negan asked in a slightly panicked voice.\nWith the archbishop's flying speed, he should've arrived very quickly. However, there weren't any signs of the thin fog being scattered in the direction of the Holy Wind Cathedral.\nOn high alert, the Wind-blessed hesitantly said, \"Perhaps, perhaps the Archbishop, the Archbishop...\"\nHe eventually failed to mention the possibility that the Archbishop wasn't in the Holy Wind Cathedral.\nAt that moment, the beautiful mistress of Duke Negan came to the window of the bedroom on the second floor, her eyes filled with a lost and beautiful smile.\nThen, she jumped down, deliberately hitting her head on the concrete floor.\nBam!\nAfter producing a jarring sound, there were quite a few cracks on her beautiful head, and blood began to flow out.\nShe rolled a few times, weakly, until she was facing up.\nHer eyes had lost all focus, and her frozen expression was one of madness and fear.\nSeeing this scene, many members of the duke's guards couldn't help but feel horrified.\nEven Duke Negan himself felt that his emotions were on the verge of collapse when Archbishop Snake didn't arrive.\n\"Let's go! Let's get out of here!\" he weakly called out on instinct.\nJust as the Wind-blessed was rejoicing over not being soft-hearted when kicking the mistress away-otherwise, the duke would've been killed on the spot-he heard a command filled with horror. His heart suddenly skipped a beat.\nInside the attic, the Desire Apostle, who was in the middle of a fierce battle, suddenly liquefied and turned into countless black shadows, jumping up and down on the ground.\nAfter dodging the blond secretary's attack, he rematerialized in another direction.\nThen, he looked at the enemy, raised his right arm, and slightly curled the corners of his mouth.\n\"No!\" The blond secretary's eyes reddened.\nAll of a sudden, the Desire Apostle clenched his fist.\nOutside the luxurious house, Duke Negan's horror erupted. It shot straight to his brain and into his veins, blanketing all his nerves.\nHe heard the sound of something shattering and felt a warm sensation at the back of his head.\nAt the same time, several members of the duke's guards became flustered and panicked. They all raised their custom revolvers or rifles in their hands and started shooting randomly towards the center.\nBang! Bang! Bang!\nThe Wind-blessed was the first to reach out and grab Duke Negan. He rolled to the ground, and a formless wind as sharp as knives appeared out of thin air, slicing through the throats of the guards.\nSplat. Splat.The guards clutched at their throats, slowly falling to the ground in a pool of fresh blood. Duke Negan's body twitched a few times, but then it stopped moving.\nHe was robbed of his life by his own horror.\nIf he hadn't been a Sequence 6 Beyonder, then his horror might've even dismembered him.\nOf course, if he hadn't become extremely weak, then he wouldn't have possessed such intense emotions. And even if he had these emotions, then he wouldn't have directly died as a result of this.\nBut there were no \"ifs\" in this world, Pallas Negan-the leader of the Conservative Party, the noble with the largest land apart from the king, the elder brother of the current Prime Minister, a Sequence 6 Beyonder, and a truly important figure- was dead.\nThe roses in the nearby glass greenhouse were still in full bloom.\nIn the attic, the blond secretary seemed to sense something and could no longer control his emotions.\nAs a result, his mind went blank, and he anxiously ran outside, automatically opening the door to the sealed room.\nTwo seconds later, he snapped to his senses and turned around again. However, the figure that was covered by the black liquid and the suitcase in the corner had disappeared.\n...\nThe Desire Apostle quickly left the villa, evacuating from the scene based on a predetermined route.\nIt was at this moment that a thick sea of blood seemed to appear before his eyes.","5":"Emlyn's mind buzzed and he blurted out, \"It's a revelation from my  Ancestor. \u2018She' told us through a dream that the apocalypse is  approaching and that we need to make preparations. And I am key in this  matter. My mission was to pray to The Fool!\"\nHearing the undisguised and detailed response, Klein, who had  prepared his answers, was at quite a loss on where to begin. This  vampire, Emlyn White, had explained everything he wanted to know.\nA revelation from the Ancestor... Didn't the ancient goddess Lilith  perish in the Second Epoch, long before the Cataclysm, and have her  authority taken back by the Creator? It was precisely because of this  that quite a number of vampires tried to pray to the Primordial Moon,  resulting in an extremely tragic outcome... Moreover, Mr. Door had also  mentioned that the \"The Moon\" card is empty, indicating that, on the one  hand, the Primordial Moon is most likely the embodiment of some other  deity or powerful devil, while on the other hand, it indirectly proves  that the ancient goddess Lilith has lost her Sequence 0 position, which  is generally equivalent to dying...Klein instantly connected the dots.\nHe originally imagined that \"Lilith,\" who responded to the Sanguine's  prayers on particular matters, was a relic from the ancient goddess,  such as the \"Uniqueness\" of \"The Moon\" pathway. Thus, it would be rigid,  passive, and extremely restrictive, but now, its initiative of  providing a revelation had overturned his guess.\nTwo possibilities. One is that Lilith is being impersonated by  another deity who has occupied a key point ahead of time, preventing any  opponents from reaching Sequence 0 of The Moon's pathway. In essence,  the entity doesn't care about the Sanguine, and the provided revelation  is a kind of test. The greatest suspect is the Goddess who had snatched  the title of Lady of Crimson, but \"She's\" already Sequence 0,  corresponding to \"The Star\" in the Cards of Blasphemy. Why would she  covet \"The Moon?\" Is it to foil the plans of her enemy?\nThe second possibility is that the ancient goddess hasn't fully  perished. As long as no other powerhouse has become Sequence 0 in the  Moon pathway, \"She\" is able to use a unique and incomprehensible method  to continue surviving, waiting for a chance to make her return, just  like the Dark Emperor card's description. And perhaps the Goddess had  taken the title of Lady of Crimson to foil this situation to a certain  extent...\nGoing by this logic, Lilith's recent apocalyptic revelation is  \"Her\" struggle to revive after years of preparation. And The Fool plays a  key role in \"Her\" revelation. If that's true, then in a certain way,  it's an invitation for \"cooperation\"... But I'm just a Sequence 6  Beyonder, so how am I to cooperate with a yet-to-disappear ancient  goddess?\nLet Emlyn White join the Tarot Club? The Sanguine are a race with  a long lifespan. They have existed since the Second Epoch and must know  quite a number of secrets... However, that would be me taking quite a  risk. Yes, it would be possible to divine whether or not to pull Emlyn  into each gathering ahead of time...\nYes, there was a similar apocalyptic prophecy in the Sights in  the Spirit World from Yellow Light Venithan. \"He\" also pointed out that  the Abraham family's curse would be removed by an Apprentice who has the  help of a hidden existence. This matches Miss Magician's present stage.  She is an Apprentice who has received the help of me, The Fool... That's  rather interesting. Has every high-level being that's good at prophecies  realized that the apocalypse is unavoidable and have seen The Fool's  existence and his possible effects?\nOne thought after another flashed through Klein's mind, but his expression didn't change at all.\nHe leaned back in his chair and smiled leisurely.\n\"What did your Ancestor ask you to pray to me for?\"\nThe calm voice pulled Emlyn out of his stupor, and he shook his head in a slightly dazed manner.\n\"I don't know...\"\nAt this moment, Klein saw the stars behind Emlyn's chair shift quickly, turning into the symbol of the crimson moon.\nAs expected, the Beyonder pathway of the descendants of the ancient goddess, Lilith, points towards the \"Moon\"...Klein  chuckled and said, \"In a situation with the seven orthodox gods and so  many secret existences, why would your Ancestor think that I would be  the key to the apocalypse?\"\nThe Fool's attitude finally made Emlyn White calm down, realizing  that he had encountered an incredible event. He had been forcefully  pulled into a magical place by a hidden existence!\n\"He\" is The Fool...\"He\" isn't actually angry... Is it because I  represent the Ancestor? I, Emlyn White, am indeed special. I was  mentioned by the Ancestor, and I received a response from The Fool...With  this in mind, Emlyn couldn't help but sit up straighter before saying  in deliberation, \"Honorable Mr. Fool, the revelation provided by the  Ancestor is this. I, Emlyn White, will become the key in saving the  Sanguine and clinching victory against the apocalypse. And all of this  will begin from my praying to you.\"\nThe meaning behind his words was:the key to the apocalypse isn't you, but me!\nThis fellow has such a \"eighth-grader syndrome1\" side to him... That's right. He has always been very arrogant and feels self-important...Klein lampooned silently with a popular phrase from the past.\nAmused, he said, \"The same question, why me and not the seven orthodox gods or the other hidden entities?\"\n\"... I don't know.\" Emlyn shook his head honestly.\nKlein thought for a moment, then he deliberately said, \"Actually, I  think I understand your ancestor's intentions. \u2018She' wishes that, with  my help, you're able to grow into a true high-level entity and save the  Sanguine when the apocalypse happens.\"\n\"Grow?\" Emlyn said in puzzlement, \"As you know, us Sanguine have no  way of growing on our own. Only through special ceremonies will we gain  the bestowment of our elders and relics of the Ancestor that allow our  advancement.\"\nIndeed, it has to be in accordance with the Law of Beyonder  Characteristics Conservation... In other words, there have to be other  ways as long as the basic law is abided to...Klein chuckled.\n\"Your knowledge has blinded you, making you unable to see the wider world.\n\"Of course, this question will not be answered by me. The answer must  be found by you. I will only provide you with an opportunity.\"\nHe paused for a second, then he said in a condescending manner, \"Do you wish for such an opportunity?\"\nWithout any hesitation, Emlyn got up and bowed.\n\"That is what I wish for!\"\nHeh, where did your arrogance go when facing a hidden existence? Why is there only humility?Klein secretly lampooned as he tapped the edge of the mottled long table and said, \"But you have to adhere to certain matters.\"\n\"Please speak.\" Emlyn held back his excitement.\nKlein smiled and replied, \"You cannot reveal anything related to me to anyone unless you gain my permission.\n\"This includes the Sanguine who were previously present at the ritual.\"\n\"But...\" Emlyn was somewhat unable to accept the request.\nKlein asked warmly in a very certain manner, \"It's likely that Lilith didn't get you to report to anyone afterward?\"\nThis could be inferred from the fact that there was no prayer content in the revelation!\nLi...\"He\" directly called the Ancestor by \"Her\" name... It sounds like they're old friends...Emlyn's heart trembled. He lowered his head and replied, \"No.\"\nKlein said with an unperturbed smile, \"This is a secret deal, which  is why I responded after you were free from surveillance. Similarly, you  don't need to report this to Lilith as it will let certain people  notice it.\"\nSeeing Emlyn nod in understanding, Klein added, \"If you want to be  the key to saving the Sanguine, you must suffer the pain of the  corresponding thorns. For example, you will not be understood by others,  be slandered, and looked down upon. You can only silently proceed  forward in the darkness while being burdened by your heavy mission.\"\nThe words that were aimed at him made Emlyn White imagine a corresponding scenario.\nHe, who was always mocked by his kinsmen because of his fondness of  dolls, had gotten lost and entered the Harvest Church. Stained with  traces of shame, he, who had never been valued and thought highly of by  his elders, would silently guard his race from the corner, protecting  everyone without anyone knowing...\nVery soon, Emlyn, who had moved himself, respectfully replied, \"Your will will pass through the earth.\"\nKlein leaned back and said very lightly, \"I tacitly consented to the  establishment of a secret gathering, and it is held right here.\n\"Are you willing to join this gathering in search for the method to become powerful to save the Sanguine?\"\n\"I am!\" Emlyn replied without any hesitation.\nKlein nodded in satisfaction.\n\"Do you have any other requests?\"\nEmlyn was overjoyed. He said in a hurry, \"Honorable Mr. Fool, I would  like you to help me dispel the psychological cue in me. A bishop of the  Church of Earth Mother...\"\n\"I know.\" Klein calmly interrupted him.\nHe knows... As expected of a hidden existence...Emlyn's head lowered again.\nKlein let out a soft chuckle.\n\"I can help you, but what price are you willing to pay for this?\"\nAbove the gray fog, he had a very potent Spirit Vision, and he had  previously discovered that the dark-colored psychological cue within  Emlyn White's Spirit Body had at some point mostly dissipated, thinning  out to the point of frailty.\nKlein had intended to resolve the problem by referring to the ritual  used to resolve similar problems in the Book of Secrets, but the  situation now led him to believe that a secret deed ritual with the Dark  Emperor card and the purification of the Sun Brooch would thoroughly  disperse Emlyn White's psychological cue.\nPrice?Emlyn thought about it for a moment, but he couldn't think of anything that would interest a secret existence like The Fool.\nSeeing this, Klein took the initiative to say, \"I'm very interested  in some of your Sanguine history. You can use that in exchange.\"\nThe Sanguine's history?After a moment's thought, Emlyn agreed.\n\"You can think about what you would like to describe first. Heh heh.  Before that, you need to choose a code name from them.\" Klein conjured  the unselected Major Arcana tarot cards on the surface of the long  bronze table.\nEmlyn White scrutinized the cards with interest and said, \"The Moon.\n\"I choose \u2018The Moon' card!\"","6":"Putting down the Classical Metallurgist potion formula, Klein cast his gaze towards the two tubes of blood Little Sun had sacrificed.\nThen, he beckoned for a ceramic jar wrapped in layers of paper figurines.\nThis was the Beyonder blood from different pathways that he had previously gathered. It had been placed above the gray fog and sealed with the Paper Angel in order to slowly integrate it into this mysterious space's aura, removing the connection between the blood and the individual. This was to prevent any accidents from happening to the provider when the door of the symbols was opened.\nTo him, it was fine if he suffered backlash. After all, there was at least one more chance of him reviving. If it would affect those who trusted him and gave their blood, he would rather not do it.\nAfter peeling off the paper figurines at the mouth of the jar and pouring the two tubes of blood into it, he conjured a glass stick and reached in to stir it.\nRight on the heels of that, he used Paper Angel and sealed it again.\nI'm just short of Prisoner, Devil, and Demoness... After I complete the ritual, I'll personally pay Miss Sharron a visit. It's better to make a request in person regarding such matters. It's too rude to do it by writing letters... Only Miss Magician is a little special. Clearly, she would prefer it if I wrote a letter rather than meet Gehrman Sparrow in person. Heh, she actually used the excuse that the ink had frozen due to the low temperatures to delay her writing. Heh, are her magic tricks just for show? Thankfully, my potion has already digested, so there's no need for me to push her anymore... Klein mumbled inwardly as he threw the ceramic jar covered in paper figurine back into the junk pile.\nAfter leaving the world above the gray fog, he didn't immediately prepare to advance to Scholar of Yore. Instead, he took out a pen and paper and drew the symbol that was a mixture of concealment and mystery prying.\nThis was something he had planned to do before he consumed the potion-to ask Arrodes about Sefirah Castle.\nAs the symbol took form, the light in the originally badly-lit room became darker, as if clouds were drifting past, blocking out the sun.\nAfter more than ten seconds, the full-body mirror with cracks suddenly rippled with aqueous light and silver words quickly appeared:\n\"Exalted Great Master, your devoted, loyal and humble servant, Arrodes, is here to answer your summoning.\n\"I-I am still the servant that you trust the most, the closest and most favorite, right?\"\nThis question... I seem to be able to read the panic and anxiety of this magic mirror... Does it feel a sense of danger? After some thought, he nodded in amusement.\n\"Yes.\"\nActually, that has never been the case... I'm just comforting you... After answering, he silently added in his heart.\nThe surface of the mirror lit up and the silver words were dyed golden.\nThey squirmed and formed a new sentence:\n\"Great Master, do you have any questions for me?\"\n\"Yes.\" Klein secretly tensed up. \"What do you know about Sefirah Castle?\"\nArrodes fell silent for a few seconds before the pale golden words changed:\n\"I don't know much about this. I've only heard some rumors. In the early days of the Second Epoch, the ancient gods believed that the original Creator left some things behind. That might be a \u2018kingdom' formed from a certain part of \u2018His' body or something created by \u2018Him.' And Sefirah Castle is one of them.\n\"This was the name that the King of Demonic Wolves, Flegrea, gave. \u2018He' calls the Hounds of Fulgrim as Sefirah Castle Keepers. However, \u2018He' failed to enter Sefirah Castle even to \u2018His' death. Therefore, many powerful creatures suspect that Sefirah Castle doesn't actually exist, but is just an abstract concept.\"\nIt had something to do with the original Creator? After pondering for a while, he said, \"One of them... How many other entities like Sefirah Castle are there?\"\n\"Eight. There are detailed records on the second Blasphemy Slate. Unfortunately, I haven't seen it.\" On the surface of the mirror, lines of words appeared one after another. However, the pale gold color faded away, becoming silver once again. \"The ancient gods suspect that the source of the underground corruption comes from a place similar to Sefirah Castle. They call it the Chaos Sea. Also, there are rumors that deep in the spirit world city, Calder\u00f3n City, there are clues to the River of Eternal Darkness. This comes from the ancient god, Phoenix Ancestor Gregrace. As for the others, I've heard of some names, but it's not a complete list. There's Tenebrous World, Knowledge Moor, as well as the Brood Hive that's related to the moon.\"\nThere are a total of eight. Chaos Sea, River of Eternal Darkness, Knowledge Moor, Tenebrous World, and Brood Hive... Brood Hive is related to the moon; it sounds very dangerous... I wonder if it has anything to do with the Mother Tree of Desire... Klein silently repeated the key information in Arrodes's response. He had a nagging feeling that he should be able to grasp something, but he didn't gain much from it. He even lacked the ability to piece together the clues.\nWhen he saw that Arrodes had only heard rumors and didn't have any actual understanding of them, he organized his thoughts and said with a smile, \"From the looks of it, you might come from the Chaos Sea.\"\n\"That's not important. What's important is that I'm your loyal, lowly, and obedient servant.\" Arrodes said the entire sentence at once.\nObedient, this use of words... Klein silently lampooned before asking, \"What are the origins of Dark Angel Sasrir?\"\nOn the surface of the mirror, silver words formed one after another:\n\"I similarly can't see it, but at that time, there was a myth that said that, when the ancient sun god was born, \u2018He' was light and darkness combined. After all, \u2018He' calls himself the Creator, so \u2018He' must be well-rounded and not lacking anything.\n\"Later, \u2018He' separated the darkness in his body and used it to create the first angel with one of his ribs, Dark Angel Sasrir.\"\nThis... rib... I can totally imagine it. Back then, it was the ancient sun god who personally fabricated and spread this myth... Amon's brother, your wife has become the Dark Angel! Klein was first alarmed before many strange ideas arose in his mind.\nAs his thoughts settled, he began to analyze the truth behind this myth.\nWith such a myth spreading, it will cause the believers to believe that Dark Angel Sasrir is the dark side of the ancient sun god. They would worship \"Him\" in the same way as the Lord. No one objected or forbade this myth. As for Dark Angel, \"He\" was ultimately the deputy of the divine kingdom, god's left hand. So this implies that this was very likely true...\nWhat happened afterward can be summarized as the dark side of the ancient sun god colluding with foreign enemies, bewitching the Kings of Angels and assassinating the main body?\nThis can explain why Ouroboros and Medici joined Rose Redemption. \"They\" were only following the orders of the \"Lord\"...\nFrom this angle, isn't the position of Dark Angel Sasrir, in the ancient sun god's divine kingdom, equivalent to The World of the Tarot Club? Hmm...\nThankfully, The World is a fake person. He doesn't have his own spirituality and thoughts...\nAs he thought about it, he suddenly felt drenched with sweat. He was glad that he was a Seer and not some other pathway.\nBased on his previous reasoning, he quickly guessed the reason why Dark Angel was sleeping in the Giant King's Court.\nPerhaps it has something to do with the fall of the ancient sun god...\nTherefore, the brother of Amon, the Dragon of Wisdom, and the True Creator wish to confirm the state of Dark Angel Sasrir...\nHowever, there are many other problems... In the twenty-two Beyonder pathways, which pathway is this King of Angels, the left hand of God?\nThe Marauder has Amon, Apprentice has Mr. Door, Spectator, Reader, Bard, Sailor, Secrets Suppliant, Warrior, Sleepless, Planter, Savant, Monster, Hunter, and Arbiter are obviously impossible... Corpse Collector is also impossible due to the existence of Death in the Fourth Epoch. It's impossible for there to be a King of Angels to exist at the same time-unless the Dark Angel had already fallen to Sequence 2... By the same logic, the Seer and Lawyer pathways can be eliminated for now. It can then be confirmed that the Dark Angel is no longer a King of Angels...\nMystery Pryer, Moon, and Devil are all certain possibilities. I cannot eliminate the possibility that the Hidden Sage, Primordial Moon, and the Dark Side of the Universe are the Dark Angel's \"alt\"... Yes, there might still be the Mother Tree of Desire hidden within...\nIt's also possible with Prisoner. There's no clear evidence that this pathway has produced a true deity. Back then, the Chained God might not even be a King of Angels.\nAfter some thought, he said to Arrodes, \"It's your turn to ask.\"\nOn the cracked full-body mirror's surface, silver words twisted together and formed a new sentence:\n\"Great Master, may I guess what you want to ask next?\"\n\"...\" Klein nodded slightly and answered, \"Sure.\"\n\"You wish to ask about Sasrir's current state. My answer is, I don't know, as I can't see.\" Behind the silver words was a smiley face with a simple drawing.\n\"Not bad,\" Klein praised. \"That's all for today. I will summon you again in the near future at any time.\"\n\"Yes, Great Master. Your loyal servant, Arrodes, is constantly preparing to serve you!\" On the surface of the mirror, the simple smile on his face turned into a waving cat's paw.\nWhen the mirror returned to normal, Klein took out a pen and paper and wrote down what he had just learned.\nThis was one of the documents he had prepared for the Scholar of Yore ritual.\nIn the past few days, he had written a lot of documents on ancient history.\nFollowing that, with the information and two marionettes, he \"Teleported\" to the Southern Continent.\nHe didn't dare to advance in Backlund. If anything were to happen to him, Amon and Zaratul would definitely be able to detect it and come straight for him!","7":"Loen Kingdom, East Chester County, Stoen City.\nHaving left the manor, Audrey moved into a villa. After she finished engaging in social gatherings with the local nobles, she sent her servant to the Varvat Bank to withdraw a sum of cash.\nShe didn't need to worry about this any further. She could easily pay off the 2,000 pounds she owed Mr. Fool's Blessed, and she could also pay the 1,800 pounds she owed Mr. World for the Psychiatrist characteristic.\nFifteen minutes later, Audrey opened the room to her bedroom and glanced at her personal maidservant, Annie, who was monitoring the servants while they did their work. She looked down at the golden retriever who was sitting by the side of the wall and smiled. With a smile, she suppressed her voice and asked with shining eyes, \"Susie, you'll receive a gift in a while. Are you looking forward to it?\"\nIf it were in the past, Audrey would've definitely said, \"Susie, your present is here,\" making the golden retriever realize that she could find the actual item in the room as well. Otherwise, it was very easy for Susie, who had been studying the basics of mysticism, to guess that Audrey had used ritualistic magic.\nWith this new sentence structure, the situation could have Audrey receive a mysterious letter or news in her bedroom to confirm that the gift was about to be delivered. There would be too many possibilities as a result of this.\nSusie could read the joy and sincere attitude deep inside Audrey's heart as she subconsciously opened her mouth, hoping to stir the air to produce a voice. She had wanted to inquire about the gift, but she sharply sensed that Audrey's personal maid, Annie, was approaching. The alert Suzie abandoned her original thoughts.\nShe returned to the state of being an ordinary dog as she slowly wagged her tail to express her joy and anticipation.\nAfter making an excuse to head out, Audrey entered a \"chemistry laboratory\" that she had specially marked out for herself. She placed the Psychiatrist characteristic and supplementary ingredients on the table.\n\"Susie, do you still remember the potion-concocting process?\" She cleared her throat and straightened her back as she excitedly played the role of a teacher.\n\"Woof, I remember!\" Susie already knew what her present was. In her joy, she barked.\nAudrey added, \"Try to concoct it by yourself.\"\nSusie looked down at her paws and suddenly fell silent.\nAudrey was taken aback before a brief silence ensued.\nA few seconds later, before the golden retriever could speak, Audrey covered her mouth without any atypical response and giggled.\n\"Alright, Susie, there's no need to say a word. I know what you wish to say. You wish to express the fact that you're only a dog and am unable to concoct the potion, right?\"\nHow embarrassing...At the same time, Audrey, who wore a charming and graceful external bearing, facepalmed herself inwardly.\n\"Woof!\" Susie nodded forcefully.\nAudrey took the opportunity and turned around. Soon, she finished concocting the Psychiatrist potion.\nShe had previously asked Susie and learned that she had already finished digesting the potion on Wednesday.\nThat's less than two months... Yes, a large reason has to do with how Susie isn't being noticed. She can run about anywhere in the manor or villa and eavesdrop, allowing her to read the true thoughts of the maidservants... That's good as well. She will always share the tidbits with me. If not for her, I wouldn't have known of the dark sides of many people who appear normal and kind usually...Audrey poured the potion into a bowl and placed it on the floor.\nShe watched as Susie went over and began licking the potion as she couldn't curb the anticipation in her heart.\nSusie might be influenced by the potion and become unstable.\nBut it's alright. Psychiatrist Miss Audrey is already prepared to use Placate at any moment! Yes, I prefer the name Psychoanalysis. That sounds more professional.\nAudrey stared at Susie with her beautiful emerald-like eyes with great seriousness and discovered that Susie's pupils were gradually fading and turning vertical. Dark gold scales seemed to grow beneath her thick fur, and the spirituality that belonged to Susie kept radiating outwards as though it was interweaving with the entire villa's space.\nAfter calming her somewhat nervous emotions, Audrey scrutinized Susie's state. As long as something abnormal happened to Susie, she would immediately use the Beyonder power, Psychoanalysis.\nSuddenly, Susie's voice sounded out in her ears.\n\"Audrey, I'm done!\"\n\"...\"\nAudrey was temporarily at a loss on what to say.\n...\nIn her dream, Daisy returned to East Borough and to the old apartment she had lived in for years.\nShe pushed open the door and saw her mother, Liz, and her sister, Freja, doing the laundry diligently.\nDaisy instantly became delighted and was just about to join them. She was in charge of ironing the laundry.\nAt this moment, she heard knocking at the door.\nShe turned her head and realized that the visitor was a young man in a black-and-white checkered police uniform.\nThe officer had black hair and green eyes, with a somewhat blurry face. He held a notebook and fountain pen as he asked, \"In the Capim case, apart from what you mentioned, is there anything else you didn't mention to us?\"\n\"It's all nothing important,\" Daisy answered in a rather groggy manner.\nThe handsome officer looked down at his notebook and said, \"It's fine. I'm willing to listen.\"\nDaisy looked back at the clothes which were hung up, feeling as though she had forgotten some instructions.\nShe honestly described all sorts of trivialities. In the end, she said, \"... After I was abducted, my mother and sister had hired a private detective to search for me. His name is Mr. Sherlock Moriarty. He's a good man. Although he didn't find me directly, he later contacted a reporter to help me get compensated with the foundation money...\"\nThe black-haired and green-eyed officer looked up again and glanced at Daisy before revealing a warm smile.\n\"Very good. Your answer is very satisfactory.\n\"Do you still remember the private detective's appearance?\"\nDaisy nodded. Without any alarm, she saw Mr. Sherlock Moriarty standing beside her.\nThe detective had grown a thick beard and wore gold-rimmed glasses. It was almost identical to the one in her memories.\nAfter the black-haired, green-eyed officer sized up the image a few times, he seemed to vanish at some point in time without Daisy realizing it. For some reason, her mother and sister had also vanished.\nShe ran through East Borough in search of the familiar figures, but she ultimately woke up from her depression and sorrow. When she saw the dark ceiling of her school dormitory, she lay there in a daze for seconds.\nDaisy didn't make a sound as she turned her body and buried half her face into the pillow.\nBy the corners of the pillow, a wet stain gradually spread out.\nThe person who had entered Daisy's dream was none other than Leonard Mitchell. Although his investigation of the commonalities of the two cases was to give him time to deal with matters of his own, he didn't forget to act in a perfunctory manner. In the end, he really discovered a problem.\nIn the cases of Lanevus and Capim, a private detective named Sherlock Moriarty was involved, including his friend, Reporter Mike Joseph... Although they had only appeared on the outskirts of this matter, it's also a direction for the investigation. heh, that Sherlock Moriarty looks somewhat familiar. Which fugitive is he?Leonard recalled what he had seen in the dream as he wore his red glove and entered the basement of Saint Samuel Cathedral.\nJust as he greeted the team captain, Soest, he saw a partner approach and hand him two thin sheets of paper.\n\"The information regarding the red-eyed man from the Harvest Church is all here.\"\n\"Thank you. Do you want to have lunch together?\" Leonard asked with a smile.\nThe Nighthawk shrugged and said, \"No, as long as you stop making me have nightmares.\"\n\"Deal.\" Leonard smiled as he received the dossier.\nHe stood there without being in a hurry to sit down as he casually browsed through it.\n\"Emlyn White. A vampire. Currently under the jurisdiction of the Church of Earth Mother... He once vanished for a period of time. His parents had hired private detectives to find him. Thanks to a particular Mr. Stuart, this matter was ultimately resolved by the famous detective, Sherlock Moriarty.\"\nLeonard's smile gradually froze as his expression turned serious.\nSherlock Moriarty?he repeated this name in his mind.\n...\nKlein wasn't in a rush to find an opportunity to engage in true acting. He toured Oravi Island's port city with the mindset of a tourist, finding a brief and rare moment of relaxation in his tense life.\nThis city had mostly immigrants from Loen. The cuisine wasn't much different from the east coast of the kingdom, with the only difference being that there were rare fruits and all sorts of seafood here. It was also quite a unique trait of the city.\nThis place was rich in natural resources and was located in a key location on the safe sea routes. The standard of living was pretty good. Even the farmers in the suburbs could save up some money through their fruit gardens.\nThis didn't mean that Oravi didn't have poor people or the lower-class. This class was mainly made up of people who were former slaves. Loen's parliament had long abolished slavery.\nAfter chewing a juicy and sweet fruit, Klein watched the sky turn dark. He took a turn at the corner of the street and entered a bar named Sweet Lemon.\nIt was a famous gathering place for adventurers in Oravi. Klein planned on buying the two remaining supplementary ingredients of a Nimblewright Master-the relatively common drago tree bark and Sonia Golden Spring water.\nAt this moment, the bar was rather lively. There were many people holding up cups around the boxing ring as they cheered loudly. There were people who looked like adventurers at the surrounding tables. They were discussing all kinds of rumors in hushed tones.\nJust as Klein was squeezing towards the bar counter, he suddenly heard his name.\n\"... I'm Gehrman Sparrow. You should know who I am. I received a treasure map and need to hire some helpers. It's not because I'm afraid, but it's because I can't carry that much treasure alone...\" A green-eyed man in his thirties held half a glass of liquor and spoke to two men and two women in the corner. It was a mystery if they were merchants or adventurers.\nYou are also named Gehrman Sparrow? Treasure map Why does it sound like a scam... My killing of Wormtongue has already reached this place from Bayam? Yes, it was likely communicated via a telegram or visitors. Therefore, many people know of my name and deeds but do not know what I look like... Cheats are using this opportunity to pass themselves off as me to cheat others...Klein moved over as he came to a realization.\nThe green-eyed man drank a mouthful of liquor and slammed the glass onto the table.\n\"I don't mind whether you refuse or agree, but I hate it when people make me wait!\n\"Do you wish to be like Wormtongue?\"\nThe young man opposite him said slightly intimidated, \"I know you're a powerful adventurer...\"\n\"So?\" The green-eyed man cut off the man's words.\nAt that moment, he felt his collar tighten as he was lifted up by someone and thrown out the door.\nKlein didn't provide an explanation as he directly threw the man out of the door with a stoic expression.\nThen, he drew his revolver and aimed it at the spot where the man had fallen to the ground. He pulled the trigger without any hesitation.\nBang!\nJust as the green-eyed man fell to the ground, he saw a spark light up at the ground near his crotch. He was so frightened that he swallowed back his cursing and scrambled away.\nWithout any explanation, his weak performance proved that he wasn't Gehrman Sparrow.\nKlein ignored the victim who stood there in a daze. He politely blew at the mouth of his revolver before stuffing it back into his underarm holster.\nFollowing that, he walked slowly to the bar counter in the resulting silent atmosphere.","8":"Sharron was silent for two seconds before she said, \"I'll help ask.\"\nIt means you need to consider it? That's right. The negative effects of Scales of Luck does leave one hesitant. However, Biological Poison Bottle is really compatible with a Wraith. If it wasn't because I'm short on money, and how it lowers my immunity, making me easily fall sick, I wouldn't be willing to sell it. It's rather effective in an ambush!Klein vaguely grasped Sharron's intentions as he stuffed the silver necklace back into his collar.\nHe asked after some thought, \"Which power of a High-Sequence Prisoner pathway Beyonder makes all surrounding lifeless items attack one's target?\"\n\"Puppet,\" Sharron succinctly replied.\nIt's the power of a Sequence 4 Puppet? Turning themselves into a lifeless puppet, so that they are able to control all lifeless objects in a certain range? Advancing further, will they be able to directly influence the mystical items of an enemy?Klein nodded in enlightenment and asked, \"Then, do you know that demigod?\"\nHe immediately described in detail the appearance of the elder who had attacked him outside Bayam.\n\"Shanks,\" Sharron calmly said a name.\nI actually wished that you could share with me more about him...Klein knew Miss Sharron's style as he said with an exasperated smile, \"Then, do you know Zatwen?\"\nHe was the mentor of the Naturism Sect's leader in Oravi Island.\n\"The demigod who was pursuing us,\" Sharron answered without hiding anything or any emotions, like a doll.\nThat's the one who made me feel like the chairs, tables, and curtains wished to kill me... What a coincidence... However, it wasn't arranged. It just proves that as a secret organization, the Rose School of Thought, with a history of over a thousand years, doesn't have that many demigods... Perhaps it has about the same number as the Aurora Order. The number of saints number around five, and the number of angels and Grade 0 Sealed Artifacts number about two to three... Of course, this is also because they were suppressed by the seven major Churches, reducing their headquarters to colonies. At the height of their powers, they might've had far more than these...Klein thought and asked again, \"Then, do you know the Rose School of Thought member that is able to make an entire mountain tremble with just one arm?\"\nHe planned on describing the arm's traits, but he realized that he hadn't dared to look straight at it.\nSharron listened quietly as her eyes darted around as though they came to life. She asked with a clear voice, \"What did you encounter?\"\nA saint, an angel, as well as Sea King, an Aurora Order demigod, a monster byproduct from the Numinous Episcopate's Artificial Death...Klein silently made a self-deprecating comment as he said with a wry smile, \"I got on the bad side with the Mother Tree of Desire, and I suffered an ambush from the Rose School of Thought. Thankfully, I was in Bayam, allowing the Church of Storms and the kingdom's military to take action. I also threw out an item corrupted with the True Creator's aura, as well as something related to the Numinous Episcopate. In short, it was chaos, and I took the opportunity to escape.\"\nHe replied frankly, apart from hiding the existence of Miss Messenger and Mr. Azik. As for the matter of the True Creator, he believed that Miss Sharron had long known that he wasn't affected by the ravings. This could be explained by a timely psychological intervention or psychic treatment.\n\"Mother Tree of Desire...\" Sharron murmured the name as rare emotional upheavals slowly appeared in her eyes.\nKlein didn't have the interpretation abilities of a Spectator, and he was unable to tell what was exactly on Sharron's mind. He could only sense that she felt a little fear and loathing.\nSharron quickly restrained her abnormal reaction, turning back into an extremely exquisite \"doll.\"\nShe looked at Sherlock Moriarty and said, \"You are very lucky and very mysterious.\"\nKlein smiled without a word, neither lying nor explaining.\nSharron didn't inquire as she said, \"You might've met Suah. \u2018He' is an Abomination born 922 years ago and claims to be the son of the Chained God. \u2018He' is also the present leader of the Rose School of Thought.\"\nNo way. The Rose School of Thought sent its leader and a demigod to deal with me... I'm just a mere Sequence 5! If not for Orange Light Hilarion's warning, I might've already been captured by the Rose School of Thought...Klein felt a chill run down his back again as he asked, \"Is Abomination the name of the Prisoner pathway's Sequence 2 or Sequence 1?\"\n\"Probably,\" Sharron didn't give an affirmative answer.\nAt this moment, without waiting for Klein's response, she said, \"Williams Street has been destroyed.\"\nKlein had pondered what kind of reaction he should have when Miss Sharron raised the topic, so he immediately frowned.\n\"By who? When did it happen?\"\n\"The Nighthawks and Machinery Hivemind. About two months ago.\" Sharron had clearly gathered the corresponding intelligence.\nKlein nodded solemnly and, after some deep thought, said, \"Perhaps we've neglected something. That evil spirit didn't need us to rescue it. It was still controlling Baronet Pound!\n\"Could it be that something happened to that gentleman, incurring the notice of the Nighthawks and Machinery Hiveminds?\" Klein offered a guess filled with half-truths without utmost confidence.\nSharron nodded.\n\"Baronet Pound died during one of his revelries.\"\nThat's it? That's the end to Alista Tudor's final bloodline?Klein thought and said, \"How's the situation with Williams Street at the moment?\"\n\"Some high-rise buildings are being built,\" Sharron described without much of an expression. \"People monitored it in secret at the beginning, but the surveillance decreased with time, diminishing to zero early last month.\"\nKlein pondered for a few seconds and said, \"Have you gone down to explore it?\"\nSharron's eyes swept his face.\n\"No.\"\nThis is her remembering our unwritten agreement-to explore it together because we found it together? What a noble-hearted lady. The Rose School of Thought's temperance faction is infinitely times better than the indulgence faction!Klein probed, \"Shall we go now?\"\n\"Alright,\" Sharron succinctly expressed her stance.\nKlein immediately instructed the carriage driver, and he changed the destination to Williams Street at the intersection of West Borough and Empress Borough.\nAlong the way, he casually mentioned what he heard and saw at sea, as well as the experiences that didn't involve his secrets. Although Sharron didn't answer him, she listened attentively, seemingly interested.\nThis made Klein recall the time when he first got to know her as Miss Bodyguard. She sat on the illusory high-back chair in the oriel window's glass. Her right hand held her cheek as she seriously listened to his conversation with Ian. She had great potential in being a Spectator.\nThe carriage passed through the silent streets in the drizzle before finally arriving near Williams Street.\nWithout approaching the area, Klein and Sharron discovered that the area had become a huge worksite.\nAfter circling to the region that matched the underground ruins, they stood behind a huge tree with a lush canopy. Klein said to Sharron, who wasn't drenched by the rain despite not holding an umbrella, \"Let's head down.\"\nAs the rain fell, they passed through Sharron's blonde hair and body before hitting the ground.\n\"Alright.\" Sharron didn't ask how Sherlock Moriarty was planning on heading down with her.\nKlein reached his hand into his pocket and easily removed the wall of spirituality, and he opened the iron cigar case.\nBeside him, a figure suddenly appeared. It was none other than Admiral of Blood Senor who wore a dark red coat and an old triangular hat.\n\"He will head down in my stead,\" Klein said with a smile.\nImmediately following that, he controlled his marionette in a composed manner.\nSenor immediately pressed his hand to his chest and bowed at Sharron.\n\"Good evening. I'm honored to work with you.\"\nSharron swept her gaze across Klein and Senor, and without a word, her body sank into the soil.\nUh, Miss Sharron seems to detest Senor quite significantly...Klein curled his lips and made Admiral of Blood rapidly turn into a Wraith and sink.\nAs for himself, he leaned on a tree, half-closed his eyes as he seriously controlled the marionette. There wasn't anyone around him, and the drizzle was light and the streetlights dim.\nSlowly, Klein found the feeling of being a Marionettist.\nHis vision and Senor's vision overlapped with one another as he saw black-brown soil, squirming worms, and miscellaneous items in between the rocks.\nAs they passed through layers of obstacles, they arrived at the region where the ruin once was. The dome ceiling had collapsed and the stone columns had snapped. The area was filled with soil and rubble, looking nothing like it once was.\nSuch a scene made Klein believe that the humanoid statues of the six deities had been completely destroyed.\nTo his joy, their location was relatively close to the room which sealed the evil spirit. That meant that he didn't need to worry that any subsequent exploration would exceed the hundred-meter range for the control of his marionette.\nAmidst the smell of soil and rot, they soon entered the previously menacing room; however, between the rubble and soil, there were only a few signs of crushed bone and rotting clothes. The dark gold and deep blue light from before had all vanished.\nThe Beyonder characteristics have been taken away by the Nighthawks and Machinery Hivemind...Senor's expression twitched as it perfectly reflected Klein's mood.\nSharron turned around in the dark solid environment and gently shook her head.\n\"They didn't send anyone in. There are no traces of living creatures existing in here.\"\nThat's right. If a living person had entered and exited this room over the past half year, a Wraith should be able to sense it... Besides, the deity statues obviously cannot be seen by the Nighthawks and Machinery Hivemind... Where did those Beyonder characteristics go?As Klein frowned, Senor had a similar reaction.\nCould it be that the evil spirit wasn't completely obliterated? It had long escaped?Klein thought about it when he suddenly came to an alarming conclusion.\nHe held back his emotions and made Senor pass through the soil and rubble-filled room with Sharron, and they arrived at the spot where the bloody door previously stood. And at that moment, only a few splinters proved that it existed before.\nAfter proceeding forward a few meters, the two truly entered the room where the evil spirit was sealed.\nIt had likewise been destroyed and buried. Klein used Senor's body and eyes to look for clues as he flew about.\n\"There should be a black high-back chair here.\" Sharron stopped and pointed at the splinters above two rocks.\nKlein instantly recalled the scene he had once seen in the dream-the young man suspected of being Medici had sat on a high-back chair, his head drooped low as though dead.\nSharron didn't pause. She continued proceeding in the compressed soil in search for any traces. Suddenly, she spoke again.\n\"There should be one here.\"\nAnother one? A second black high-back chair?\"Klein\" floated over in surprise.","9":"As he had personal experience, Klein placed himself in the shoes of the Dark Demonic Wolf and pondered.\nUsually, he would shut down the automatic prayer response to prevent an enemy from using the feedback to establish a connection and lock onto his position;\nUnder this premise, to receive a sudden prayer from a stranger would no doubt lead to \"Him\" relying on the corresponding point of light to observe the supplicant and grasp more information. This allowed \"Him\" to make preparations for what might happen in the future;\nIf the person chanting the honorific name was a powerful existence like Amon or someone relatively more familiar, it would be best to destroy that point of light immediately. However, if the person was a stranger, under such a situation where \"He\" was completely safe, \"He\" would monitor him for a long period of time to understand the exact situation and see if there was a need for a counterattack. It was something that every rational creature would most likely do. At the very least, Klein would do so.\nThe essence of this matter was that non-Mythical Creatures were marked by high-level existences. They could die in a baffling and tragic manner at any moment. To the supplicant, this was equivalent to suicide or something even more terrifying. To the Dark Demonic Wolf, it was only a positive outcome, nothing negative.\nAt the beginning, the suspicious Dark Demonic Wolf would definitely suspect that there was a conspiracy. \"He\" wouldn't dare to establish a connection and influence Klein from a distance. However, with the passage of time, as the observations deepened and a confirmation was made that the other party was a non-angel weakling who possessed the aura of Sefirah Castle with signs of being unprepared, \"He\" would definitely find an opportunity to attack from afar. At the time when Klein was most unprepared, \"He\" would mark the prayer light and deal a remote attack.\nThis aligned with Klein's previous conclusion about his advantage that Klein-\"I'm very weak.\"\nThe only problem with this plan was that the initiative was completely in the hands of the Dark Demonic Wolf. Everything Klein did would be monitored, and there was no way to prepare ahead of time. Once the other party tried to exert \"His\" influence on him, he would not be able to fight back and wouldn't be spared.\nPhew, by doing so, I would successfully bait the prey, but kill the hunter as a result... It's meaningless... Yet, if I don't place myself in such a passive position, it will be difficult to bait an angel of the Seer pathway, the paranoid demonic wolf... This is something that a marionette or others cannot do in my stead... If only I can be certain that the Dark Demonic Wolf wouldn't rashly attack remotely because of \"His\" paranoia and will only choose to monitor and observe... Thoughts raced through Klein's mind as he sought out the possibilities amongst numerous impossibilities.\nWith regards to this, he could only sigh inwardly, feeling regretful for not being an angel from the Spectator pathway.\nAccording to his assumptions, the angels of the Spectator pathway would more or less have some special characteristics of \"the more others know about you, the more you understand them.\" When the Dark Demonic Wolf monitored him closely through prayer light and ended up carefully observing an angel from the Spectator pathway, \"His\" position would undoubtedly be exposed to the other party.\nUnfortunately, I'm not... Besides, the Spectator pathway's Sequence 2 might not be able to do so. I can only be certain that a Sequence 1 has this special trait... Summoning 0-08 from the fog of history? No, let's not talk about whether I can summon that quill without Groselle's Travels. Even if I successfully create a projection, the quill is a quill while I am still myself. The Dark Demonic Wolf's understanding of me doesn't make 0-08 do the reverse. Also, I can only use it for a mere two minutes. It wouldn't be enough to sense anything... It can be used as supplementary to the plan, writing the development I wish to see happen, making the Dark Demonic Wolf's \"choice\" appear reasonable so as to eliminate uncertain elements... Klein considered for a long while, but he failed to find a suitable plan to bait his prey.\nApart from feeling regretful that he wasn't a Sequence 1 angel of the Spectator pathway, he had also thought of the cosmos:\nJust learning of it would result in corruption from the cosmos!\nIf I had the nature of the cosmos, then after the Dark Demonic Wolf uses the prayer point of light to monitor me, \"He\" would be corrupted, allowing me to lock onto \"His\" position. However, the cosmos's nature is higher than that of an angel. How could I have it... I keep feeling like I've forgotten something... Klein made The World Gehrman Sparrow shake his head indiscernibly as he surveyed the area.\n\"There's no need to discuss the answer now. You can go back and communicate with the right person with suitable methods.\"\nHe focused his attention on The Star Leonard and The Hermit Cattleya, hoping that they would be able to get advice from the existences that were more experienced such as Pallez Zoroast and Queen Mystic Bernadette.\nAs for himself, he would return to Backlund with the aid of the historical projection. He would seek advice from Miss Messenger, Will Auceptin, and the ascetic, Arianna.\nThis is what it means to seek the opinions of angels or quasi-Angels before making a major decision... Klein made a self-deprecatory comment.\nWhen Leonard and Cattleya heard that, they nodded in unison.\n\"Alright.\"\nFollowing that, the members of the Tarot Club began discussing the situations of the various battlefields until the end of the gathering.\n...\nAfter returning to the real world, Leonard, who was resting in Saint Samuel Cathedral's basement, spoke in a low voice, explaining all the questions that Klein had posed to him and said, \"Old Man, do you have any suggestions?\"\n\"This is him trying to obtain the Miracle Invoker Beyonder characteristic left behind in the Forsaken Land of the Gods...\" Pallez Zoroast was first enlightened before he chuckled. \"Tell your former colleague that there's no way he can resolve this matter himself. I only have one suggestion. That is to seek help from The Fool!\"\nLeonard knew Old Man's character very well. He hurriedly asked, \"Is this really the only suggestion?\"\nPallez Zoroast harrumphed and said, \"That's a Mythical Creature that even Amon can't capture. It's possible only by relying on The Fool's help.\"\nOnly then did Leonard nod and sigh.\n\"It seems that's the only way...\"\n...\nTwo days later, two minutes before the meeting time that The Moon Emlyn had agreed to meet Maric.\nFors sat on a reclining chair beside the fireplace and listened to the commotion on the second floor. She cast her gaze at her friend, Xio.\n\"If the war continues, Backlund will definitely suffer more attacks. Are you really not going to evacuate your mother and brother to the surrounding villages?\"\nXio's short, light-blonde hair was parted in an asymmetrical fashion and was neatly combed. Compared to last year, she looked more serious and had the bearing of an adjudicator. She was like a high-ranking knight leading an order of knights.\nShe hesitantly said, \"The population in the surrounding villages has reached its limit. Besides, I can still get enough food from MI9 now.\"\nHaving said that, she paused and said, \"If the flames of war really reach Backlund, take them \u2018Traveling' to Intis and Feynapotter...\"\n\"It seems that's the only way...\" Just as Fors was about to mention the matter of her buying food in Intis a few days ago, she suddenly heard the alarm ring.\nShe shivered and suddenly sat up straight. She stretched out her right hand, which was wearing a red string, and grabbed into the air.\nHer arm sank as she pulled out Gehrman Sparrow, who was wearing a silk top hat and a black trench coat without glasses.\nThe cold adventurer's eyes rolled and gained consciousness, reducing the amount of spirituality that Miss Magician had to expend.\nHe nodded gently as he made the glove on his left hand become transparent.\nIn less than a second, Gehrman Sparrow \"Teleported\" away and disappeared from Fors and Xio's rented apartment.\n\"...\" Fors was stunned for a moment before the corners of her mouth twitched slightly. She turned to Xio and said, \"I think I'm just a tool...\"\n...\nThe sky was already dark, but the street lamps weren't lit up. Only the crimson moon illuminated the entire city.\nWhen Klein arrived at the agreed-upon place, he looked around and saw the unusually cold streets, the burning marks on the walls, and the collapsed buildings not far away for a few seconds.\nJust based on what he saw, Backlund was desolate and dilapidated. It even had the smell of gunpowder wafting through the city.\nAt this moment, Emlyn White walked out of an alley and nodded at the crazy adventurer.\nAccording to Gehrman Sparrow's instructions, he didn't say a word or bow. To prevent any delay in whatever precious time Gehrman Sparrow had, he led him to a nearby house and knocked on the door rhythmically.\nWith a creak, the door opened automatically, revealing a dark environment blanketed with faint moonlight.\nThe moment Emlyn and Klein entered, they saw the white-shirt and black-vested Maric sitting on the sofa. The door behind them seemed to have a life of its own as it slammed to a close.\nAfter taking a glance at him, Emlyn smiled and pointed at him.\n\"This is my partner, Mr. Gehrman Sparrow.\"\nJust as he finished speaking, he suddenly realized that the way Maric looked at him was even odder, as though he was examining an idiot.\n\"Long time no see.\" Maric immediately stood up, pressed his hand to his chest, and bowed at Sherlock Moriarty.\nSince the other party didn't appear in the image of Sherlock Moriarty, he definitely wouldn't take the initiative to mention such matters.\n\"Long time no see.\" Klein took off his hat and surveyed the area. \"Miss Sharron, please come out for the discussion. I have limited time.\"\nAs he spoke, he took out a silver adventurer's harmonica and blew into it.\nA figure wearing a dark and complicated long dress holding four blonde, red-eyed heads walked out from the void.\nThe messenger summoned by the harmonica's historical projection was an objective existence. It didn't increase the spirituality burden of Fors.\nAt the same time, Maric nodded and said, \"Alright.\"\nHe cast his gaze on the high stool on the other side of the room.\nEmlyn looked at the Wraith in a daze, then at Gehrman Sparrow and the spirit world creature he summoned. For some reason, he felt like he had been ostracized and didn't belong here.\nAnd on that high stool, a figure quickly outlined itself. Her skin was fair like a doll, and she wore an exquisite black regal dress and a small bonnet of the same color. Her blonde hair and blue eyes were slightly pale in color.","10":"After opening the \"door\" to the Body of Heart and Mind, Klein carefully extracted the memories related to The Fool. He gathered them together and \"Grafted\" them above the gray fog.\nFollowing that, he saw the blonde-haired Audrey, who had a light white silk scarf covering her eyes, appear on the ancient stone steps. Step by step, she landed onto his mind island via the sea of collective subconscious.\nAfter some hesitation, Klein no longer allowed his consciousness to stay high in the sky. He gave up the corresponding control and allowed them to return and fuse together.\nIf he didn't do that, he would maintain absolute rationality in the subsequent treatment, making him unable to be moved by all kinds of memories and lose the possibility of strengthening his humanity.\nThis meant that Audrey's treatment was destined to fail right from the start.\nAfter arriving at the mind island that resembled a dream world using her spiritual intuition, Audrey stopped and spread her arms slightly.\nShe recalled her parents' love for her, the excitement she felt when she first became a Beyonder, and the joy she felt after helping others to change her emotions and emit corresponding fluctuations.\nThis was a method of awakening Gehrman Sparrow's memories related to his humanity. It was a Beyonder manifestation of the effects of \"empathy.\"\nScenes that were worth cherishing, or those hiding deep within, flashed across Audrey's mind one after another. Beneath her feet, from the surface of the island that represented Klein's mind, firefly-like light points seeped out of the \"soil\" and floated up.\nEvery point of light presented a different scene:\n\"A kid taking a stride forward with his short legs, receiving an ice-cream;\n\"A student secretly reading novels and comics under the cover of a textbook.\"\n\"A teenager sitting in front of his computer and playing games with full focus. Hearing the sound of a key suddenly being inserted into a keyhole, he jumped up and performed a force shutdown on his computer. Rushing back to his room, happy that his actions weren't discovered, he had a bounce in his step. Going to the living room, he asked his mother for pocket money, before appearing beside his father to casually ask questions about his studies;\n\"A young adult and his companions pushing a bashful friend to the corridor, right up to the person he had a crush on. Then, turning around, he laughed loudly;\n\"A young adult with some hint of adolescence to him stealing a glance downstairs, watching a figure leave, but unable to open his mouth no matter what;\n\"An employee with a slightly protruding belly waving his hand impatiently when he returned home for the holidays. After telling his parents not to serve him food or set up blind dates for him, he sees his parents' white hair and loses himself in thought when he calmed down;\n\"A scholarly-looking man and his brother and sister moving out. When they saw the dirt and dust on each other's faces, they laughed;\n\"...\"\nKlein sat at the round table at the veranda, one hand holding his top hat and the other hanging in midair, as though he wanted to cover his face.\nTwo transparent drops of water slowly slid past the two sides of his nose bridge and dripped into the void.\nKlein closed his eyes, his expression soft and pained.\nIn his mind island, Audrey seemed to have transformed into a whirlpool of emotions as she pulled together similar memories.\nAfter the entire island was covered in firefly-like points of light, a faint gray fog emerged.\nIn the fog, there was a door of light that was dyed bluish-black. It was formed from illusory and brilliant spherical light.\nThe main body of each spherical light was composed of transparent, ringed, or starlight-like worms and insects. They embraced each other and intertwined like mythical creatures.\nThe door of light looked a little odd at first glance, but if one looked closely, they would discover that its surroundings were dark. It was as though it was wearing a hooded black robe.\nThus, on a whole, it looked like an unknown mysterious person hiding under a robe.\nIn the next second, a slippery, illusory tentacle appeared under the deep black robe of the mysterious person.\nAt that moment, although Audrey's consciousness couldn't see or hear anything, her spiritual intuition gave her a strong sense of danger. She had a feeling that a sea consisting of corruption was about to drown her.\nNo, this isn't an illusion! She believed that if things continued to develop like this, she would get infected with a severe mental illness, or even lose control and go crazy on the spot!\nAudrey was just about to \"Placate\" herself with all her might, weakening the corruption ahead of her when the firefly-like light dots floating above the island rapidly gathered. They illuminated the grayish-white fog, diluting the darkness around the strange door of light, making the tentacles covered in mysterious patterns shrink back.\nThis was also the reason why Klein could receive psychological treatment only after barely suppressing the awakening Celestial Worthy's consciousness.\nThis made Audrey sense the weakening of the danger, and she quickly did a Psychoanalysis. Then, she immediately \"Placated\" the corruption, performing a true act of hypnosis.\nAfter repeating it over and over again, Audrey took an unknown amount of time before she finally managed to obtain the initial results she expected.\nShe then left Gehrman Sparrow's mind island and returned to her body.\nThis treatment was very difficult, so she didn't use a \"Virtual Persona\" and directly used her Body of Heart and Mind.\nAfter sensing the end of the treatment, Klein raised his hand to wipe his face, allowing The Fool's memories \"Grafted\" above the gray fog to return to his true body.\nA few seconds later, Audrey removed the white silk scarf wrapped around her eyes and nose, snapping herself out of her self-hypnosis.\nShe looked at Mr. World opposite her and muttered to herself poignantly, \"Is this the mental problem brought by godhood?\"\nHow terrifying...\nKlein nodded slightly and said, \"Yes, every angel has one. The only difference is whether it's serious or very serious.\"\n\"Saints have it too. Even Low- and Mid-Sequence Beyonders who aren't demigods will have it\ntoo.\" Audrey added with Gehrman Sparrow's former explanation.\n\"To a Low- or Mid-Sequence Beyonder, the remnant mental imprint of the former owner of the characteristic is relatively more dangerous.\" Klein picked up the gold-lined cup and took a sip. \"This is the cruel law of the mysterious world. This is because our Beyonder powers come from external objects, from the Beyonder characteristics.\"\nAudrey nodded before shaking her head gently. As she contemplated, she said, \"I don't think it's that pessimistic, just like the source of every human life comes from something else: air, bread, meat, water, etc.\n\"When we absorb them, we will also absorb their negative effects, accumulating all kinds of problems that eventually make us fall sick. However, this doesn't mean that we have to completely resist them and treat them as external objects. Once they're absorbed, there will always be some part of it that belongs to us.\n\"I didn't express it well, but I believe you should understand what I mean.\"\nKlein was taken aback for a moment before replying thoughtfully, \"A Beyonders acquisition of a Beyonder characteristic is like humans having food?\n\"Then, one should have peace of mind and not have too many repulsive thoughts; it's about resisting it, but also working alongside it; and suppressing it, but also fusing together with it?\"\n\"Roughly like that.\" After Audrey said that, she laughed self-deprecatingly. \"However, this also seems to imply a negative message: humans will eventually die, but Beyonders...\"\nShe didn't finish her sentence, unwilling to agitate the patient opposite her.\nShe switched topics and said, \"Pay a visit another two times this week. I'll be able to stabilize you under normal conditions. Yes, normal conditions.\n\"Also, you can reminisce about things when you're free, or go somewhere you yearn to go.\"\nKlein nodded and said, \"What do you have in mind about Wrath's suggestion?\"\nThe smile on Audrey's face slowly disappeared as her expression gradually turned serious.\n\"Do you have any suggestions?\"\nKlein put down his teacup and calmly said, \"Strictly speaking, the danger you bring is divided into two categories: One is when you actively or passively involve yourself in certain matters, attracting powerful enemies to your side, implicating your family, relatives, friends, and the innocent. The other is that your very existence allows some factions to target the people you value the most, doing so to threaten you.\n\"For the latter, unless you're dead, there's no way for you to ever avoid them. Of course, most of these things are a result of the former.\n\"If you give up on all your current identities in the mysticism world, and only be Mr. Fool's believer and Miss Audrey Hall from now on, no longer taking the initiative to participate in matters related to Beyonder or other matters with unpredictable elements, you can avoid most of the risks of the former and drastically reduce the latter.\n\"Under such circumstances, with the Evernight Goddess favoring the Hall family, and Mr. Fool's protection provided to you is enough to deal with the rare instances of dangers, ensuring your family's safety.\n\"That's why there's no need to split off another identity.\"\nAudrey fell silent for a while. She bit her lower lip indiscernibly and asked, \"What if I do want to split off an identity?\"\n\"As long as you let that identity believe in Mr. Fool, it's not much different from what I said just now. The only difference is that, from this point forth, you'll have to stay away from your family and friends and live with another identity.\" Klein's voice sank slightly as he said in a serious tone, \"Also, are you really fine with Hermes splitting off an identity for you?\"\nAudrey's emotions were disrupted by this question. Her eyes flickered as she said, \"However, splitting identities should be a Beyonder powers of a Sequence 3 Dreamweaver.\"\nShe definitely wouldn't be able to accomplish it by herself.\nThe corners of Klein's mouth curled up as he suddenly asked, \"You're able to use that Pride mask to enter the Garden of Eden directly?\"\nAs Audrey couldn't take the initiative to mention the Psychology Alchemists, he very directly pointed it out.\nAudrey nodded gently, surprised, puzzled, and guessed something.\n\"I'm unable to pay the equivalent price, and...\"\nWithout waiting for her to finish, Klein said with a cold expression,\n\"On the one hand, Adam has drifted from Mr. Fool and nearly killed me. On the other hand, with the apocalypse approaching, Mr. Fool has prophesied something: when the time comes, \u2018He' might fall asleep again. As \u2018His' Blessed, I won't be able to escape a similar fate. The payment you need to pay is that, when such an anomaly happens, perform certain dangerous things according to Mr. Fool's instructions and try hard to awaken \u2018Him.'\"\nWithout giving Miss Justice a chance to digest this sentence, Klein extended his right hand and grabbed a few times at the void ahead of him, pulling out a grayish-white, cold persona mask.\nUsing his status and Audrey's trust in him, he forcefully summoned the projection of the Pride mask from the Historical Void.\n\"It's connected to my mind, so no one else can use it.\" Audrey subconsciously pointed out the problem when she saw this.\n\"Give me a strand of hair,\" Klein said calmly.\nAudrey didn't think too much about it. She plucked out a strand of blonde hair and handed it to Gehrman Sparrow.\nKlein took the strand of hair and wrapped it in the eye holes in the persona mask.\nThen, he held his silk hat in one hand and the grayish-white mask in the other as he slowly stood up.\nDuring this process, he mobilized Sefirah Castle and \"Deceived\" the rules.\nPa!\nKlein wore the Pride mask without facing any resistance. Immediately, he saw human-clothed animals walking upright.\nHe had entered the Garden of Eden directly.\nLooking at the black cathedral in the middle of the city, Klein curled his lips and took out the Staff of the Stars and wore the silk top hat over his head.","11":"West Borough, Grimm Garden Street\nKlein, with a quite a stubble around his mouth, wore a pair of gold-rimmed glasses while carrying a top hat and a black cane. He followed Rogo Colloman into a spacious and bright living room.\nThere was a huge crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling. The walls, corners, and tables were decorated with all kinds of golden carvings and ornaments. The entire area looked gorgeous, exquisite, and luxurious.\nAs expected of a jewelry businessman, a businessman staying in West Borough...Klein scanned the oil paintings by the side and sighed.\nWith every step Rogo took, the fat on his body quivered. It left people maliciously wondering when his clothes and pants would snap.\nHowever, as a jewelry businessman, he had enough money to buy clothes of the best quality.\n\"Detective Moriarty, this is my son, Adol.\" Logo stopped at the edge of a carpet and pointed to a boy that was 15 or 16 years old and was sitting on a single sofa.\nAs all the fireplaces in the house were lit, and there were metallic pipes to conduct the heat around, the living room was rather warm. It even made Klein feel like taking off his clothes until he only had a shirt and a pair of trousers left. However, the boy was wrapped in a thick fur coat and had a blanket that looked burning hot on his legs.\nAt that moment, he had his head low, tightly hugging himself as he shivered nonstop. His dark blue hair seemed to have lost its luster.\nRogo looked at him with concern and raised his voice slightly, \"Adol, this is Detective Moriarty. He will be protecting you for today and tomorrow.\"\nAt these words, Adol raised his head, revealing his pale face, his bluish lips, and his unfocused eyes.\n\"Protect me, protect me... They're going to kill me! They want to kill me!\" His voice became sharper and sharper. In the end, he covered his ears with his hands and screamed.\nAfter a few seconds, he gradually calmed down.\nDuring this process, Klein had already tapped his molars and secretly activated his Spirit Vision.\nHuh...He held back the shock that had crept up to his mouth and carefully examined him again.\nHe saw that the color of Adol's aura had been dyed with a deep blackish-green sheen!\nThis is a sign of being haunted by wraiths, a sign of possible possession!\nAdol's bad friends are already taking revenge on him... Or perhaps, there were no such things as \"bad company\" at all...Klein quietly reached out, held Mr. Azik's copper whistle, and allowed his spirituality to spread. Then, he thoughtfully looked away from Adol and looked at the others inside the living room.\nBy the oriel window stood a man in a black coat. He was tall and sturdy, not smiling, and his waist was bulging as if he were hiding a gun.\nThis should be one of the six bodyguards...Klein was about to size up another person when Rogo Colloman introduced, \"Detective Kaslana; her assistant, Lydia.\n\"Detective Stuart.\"\nAt this point, Rogo turned around and pointed at Klein.\n\"This is Detective Sherlock Moriarty.\"\nKaslana was in her thirties, had black hair and blue eyes, and thick eyebrows. She was probably a beauty when she was young, but now, because of the sagging muscles on her cheeks, she didn't seem very amiable.\nLydia, her assistant, was a red-haired lady of about twenty years of age. Her figure was excellent, but she had an average appearance.\nBoth women wore something similar to what aristocratic riders wore. The white shirts they wore were tight at the waist which matched the more tight-fitting trousers that facilitated movement. The pleats were the only thing that distinguished their clothes from men.\nIn addition, they provided no concealment for the two revolvers around their waists.\nThis reminded Klein of a saying from Lawyer Jurgen that illegal possession of a gun was a sure thing for a private investigator. This was because-unless one was a noble, a Member of Parliament, or a senior civil servant-it was very difficult to obtain an all-purpose weapon permit.\nStuart sat opposite to Kaslana and Lydia. He had a lean face, but he grew a bushy beard. His light green eyes were unusually lively.\nHe was about the same age as Lydia, and almost as tall as Klein, a little over 1.7m and weighing 140lb.\nStuart had an armpit holster, and in it, there was obviously a specially designed revolver.\nAfter exchanging pleasantries, Klein took off his coat, took off his hat, and handed it to the maidservant next to him.\n\"Put it somewhere I can retrieve it quickly from. There are some important items inside.\"\nIn fact, he had already transferred the paper figurines, notes, charms, a matchbox, etc to his trouser pockets. The only thing left in his coat was herbal powder, extract essence, keys, and his wallet. There were a total of 206 pounds in paper bills in his wallet.\nStuart, who was sitting there, turned his head to size Klein up and chuckled. \"You didn't bring a gun?\"\n\"Gun? This is my gun.\" Klein smiled and raised his cane.\nAt the same time, he puffed out his cheeks to stimulate a sound.\nBang!\nThe sound of a gunshot rang out, and without thinking, Stuart rolled over, while Kaslana and Lydia quickly got off the sofa, each finding a place to hide.\nRogo and the servant beside him were both surprised and confused about what was happening. Adol continued keeping his head low as he shivered.\nWhen they saw that Klein was only holding onto a black cane and realized that nothing had happened, Kaslana and company calmed down. They frowned and asked, \"What just happened?\"\n\"Ever since I handed a revolver I picked up to the police, I've been learning how to imitate its sound. It seems to be quite effective,\" Klein replied half-jokingly.\n\"That's not funny, Detective Moriarty,\" Kaslana said in a deep voice.\nI just wanted to perform some magic for you...Klein lampooned. He handed his cane to the maidservant and solemnly nodded.\n\"I will keep that in mind.\"\nStuart, who was in the most pathetic state a moment ago, didn't seem to be angry at all. He patted his clothes with great interest, got up and asked, \"Why haven't I heard of you, Mr. Moriarty? I mean, I know a lot of people in the detective business, but I've not heard about you in the past.\"\n\"I only came to Backlund in early September,\" Klein briefly explained.\n\"Is that so...\" Stuart laughed and said, \"Tonight, the two of us will pair up. We'll be in charge of everything from midnight until tomorrow morning. Will that be a problem?\"\n\"Nope,\" Klein responded with the same smile.\n\"Okay, after dinner, you guys have some rest and take over your shifts in the early morning,\" Kaslana added.\nKlein took a long look at the trembling Adol and nodded seriously.\n...\nNothing happened throughout the afternoon, and the worried male and female hosts prepared a hearty dinner for the detectives and the bodyguards, but no alcoholic beverages were provided.\nAfter eating and drinking to his heart's content, Klein and Stuart, a young man with a full beard, went to their rooms on the second floor.\nSeeing that no one was around, Stuart shook his head and said, \"Sherlock, you should've noticed that the problem with Adol isn't something regarding revenge.\"\nBro, you sure are affable...Klein's expression didn't change as he asked, \"Why do you say that?\"\n\"He looks more like he has a mental problem, or, according to the countryside, he's been haunted by ghosts and evil spirits. Frankly, I'm afraid of that.\" Stuart sighed. \"Mr. Colloman should take him to a psychiatrist, and if that doesn't work, get the priests from the Lord of Storms to sprinkle some holy water and perform a ritual.\"\n\"You can suggest it to him,\" Klein said objectively.\n\"If Adol doesn't get better, I'll consider it in about a couple of days.\" Stuart glanced sideways at Klein.\nKlein laughed and replied, \"That's up to you. My mission will be over tomorrow.\"\nAt that moment, the two of them had arrived at their destination and entered their respective rooms.\n...\nOne in the morning, inside Adol's bedroom.\nKlein sat in a rocking chair, holding onto Azik's copper whistle, quietly watching his ward. Stuart sipped his coffee at his desk.\nThe two of them didn't speak, afraid that they would wake the sleeping Adol.\nAs time passed, a cold chill swept through the room.\nAdol sat up and opened his eyes.\n\"What's wrong?\" Stuart asked somewhat nervously.\n\"To... the washroom...\" Adol replied in a soft, dreamy voice.\nHis face seemed paler, and his lips were turning purple.\nStuart was about to speak when he saw Sherlock Moriarty stand up and nod at him.\n\"I'll follow him.\"\n\"Alright.\" Stuart let out a sigh of relief.\nPutting his hands into his pockets, Klein stayed one step behind Adol and followed him to the entrance of the washroom two rooms away.\nJust as Adol was about to close the door behind him, he saw a figure flash in.\n\"I can't let you out of my sight. Heh, do whatever you have to do, and pretend that I don't exist.\" Klein smiled and leaned against the wall.\nAdol remained silent, his eyes unfocused as he looked into the mirror.\nHe turned on the faucet and let the water flow.\nAt this moment, Klein took out a box of matches and lit a matchstick, as though he wanted to smoke.\nHowever, he didn't do so. He blew on the air and allowed the match to go out.\nPa!\nKlein casually threw the match in front of him and took out another item.\nAdol, whose back was facing him, suddenly straightened up. The figure in the mirror was so pale that it looked like a corpse.\nWhoosh!In the washroom, a cold wind howled. While keeping his lower body fixed, Adol turned around and glared at Klein's left hand, at the delicate copper whistle that was being tossed up and down.\nWhoosh!\nA gust of cold wind blew across Klein's face.\nHe continued smiling and snapped his fingers.\nWith a loud bang, a flame rose from the ground, igniting an invisible figure.\nThe figure struggled for a few moments before completely dispersing. The flames extinguished as a result.\nKlein put away Azik's copper whistle and looked calmly at Adol, whose eyes were beginning to focus.\nAdol appeared to have finally awoken from a long nightmare.\nHe saw a young man standing a few steps away. The man was wearing a white shirt, dark trousers, and a pair of gold-rimmed glasses. He was leaning against the wall with a smile on his face.\nThen, he heard a gentle voice.\n\"What happened to you?\"","12":"Mr. Door... This naming style is very similar to mine... I wonder what was the real name of this pathetic fellow who was lost and trapped in the deep darkness amidst the storms is, and what his Sequence is. Or rather, just as Emperor Roselle had guessed, he's one of the evil gods or devils...Klein let out a silent chuckle which was mixed with ridicule and self-deprecating humor. He was also interested in the history of the Fourth Epoch.\n\"I know of the most famous \u2018War of the Four Emperors' in the Fourth Epoch, but the specific details and the main figures involved are limited to the information spread by the major Churches. For example, the \u2018Dark Emperor' of the Solomon Empire.\n\"It wasn't until today that this so-called Mr. Door finally answered my questions by letting me know who the remaining three emperors are. The half-insane Blood Emperor of the Tudor Dynasty, the Night Emperor of the Trunsoest Empire, and the Emperor of the Underworld of the Southern Continent, also known as Death.\n\"According to Mr. Door's description, in this war that changed the situation of the entire world, the Dark Emperor, Blood Emperor and Night Emperor fell one after another. The Emperor of the Underworld reaped the greatest benefits.\n\"Having said that, Mr. Door added with profound significance that after over a century of \u2018digestion,' Death went mad, but he also became stronger. Therefore, Death teamed up with the Primordial Demoness and brought about a Pale Disaster for the Northern Continent. Of course, this isn't something he witnessed personally, but rather something that he hears when he comes close to the real world every month.\n\"Death went mad, but also became stronger!\n\"Even deities can go mad?\n\"What a horrifying sentence!\n\"However, this also confirms my guess. Before the Fifth Epoch, those deities would often descend into the real world, directly interfering with the situation in the Northern and Southern Continents. They might even personally appear just like Death.\n\"I asked Mr. Door if he had participated in the \u2018War of the Four Emperors'? If so, what role did he play? And what was the position the seven deities maintained in this war? What role did they play?\n\"Mr. Door didn't answer my question. He only said in a teasing manner that the number of pre-eminent mighty figures in the Fourth Epoch far exceeds my imagination.\n\"In addition, he also mentioned two laws, one is the Law of Beyonder Characteristics Indestructibility, and the other is the Law of Similar Sequence Beyonder Characteristics Conservation, which is consistent with certain things that I have learned from that most secret and ancient organization, and also from some of the phenomena I have observed. Heh, this can lead to many interesting conclusions, making many explanations take on other forms, making one's mind tremble in horror. For example, when there are too many High-Sequence Beyonders in the same Sequence pathway, the Low-Sequence Beyonders would reduce, and vice-versa.\n\"... The Beyonder Characteristics had been fixed at the source. It will not increase or decrease. Does this mean that there really is a God who created all the deities, an omnipotent and omniscient God, and everything originated from Him?\"\nThis was the longest Roselle diary that Klein had ever seen. It took up two full pages, and one could imagine that it originally came on a double-sided page. It only became two separate pages after repeated copying.\nThat's a lot of information...Klein sighed silently.\nAs a history student who had graduated normally, he had always believed that the Solomon Empire, the Tudor Dynasty, and the Trunsoest Empire came one after the other in a line, with a certain degree of restoration before a new political outcome was established. To his surprise, the War of the Four Emperors described by Mr. Door clearly and unambiguously revealed one thing-all three empires had existed at the same time!\nIf this were true, then it would really overturn most of the current research on the Fourth Epoch in the field of history. Klein suddenly thought of the original Klein, who was filled with interest towards archeology and the history regarding the Fourth Epoch.\nToday, I've helped him achieve his wish... I wonder if Death had already become a true deity during the War of the Four Emperors. It's hard to determine according to Mr. Door's descriptions. I can only first assume that the Emperor of the Underworld, who had obtained benefits from the War of the Four Emperors, had broken through his limits and become a deity, but \"He\" also went mad as a result...\nTo have a deity go mad was truly terrifying. Just thinking about the details makes one tremble from the bottom of their heart! It's no wonder that the knowledgeable Emperor Roselle would use the word \"horrifying\" to describe this matter...\nCould it be that the so-called evil gods were crazy orthodox deities?\nWould that mean that there might only be evil gods left in this world one day...\nMan, does this mean that the end of days cannot be stopped?\nKlein smiled to hide the growing solemnity of his emotions. He felt that the future he imagined was filled with a dark gray hue.\nAt the same time, he raised his evaluation of the Dark Emperor, Blood Emperor, and Night Emperor, believing them to be the pre-eminent mighty figures who were close to being deities.\nPerhaps that means Sequence 1 is the peak existence of a single pathway. According to this logic, for Dark Emperor to live for centuries or over a millennium wouldn't be unacceptable. That would explain the original Klein's confusion. He had obtained contradictory findings from the content recorded in the Antigonus family's notebook with his own mentor's viewpoint. He believed that the Dark Emperor was the common name used by every emperor of the Solomon Empire... Perhaps, the Dark Emperor had always been the same Dark Emperor... Of course, other possibilities cannot be eliminated. For example, they could've been replaced two or three times, but is the name of that pathway's Sequence 1, Dark Emperor?\nI wonder who Mr. Door is in the history of the Fourth Epoch... Emperor Roselle didn't go into detail when describing his erroneous experiments and accidental coincidences, making it impossible for me to even try to converse with that Mr. Door.\nThe Laws of Beyonder Characteristics Indestructibility and Similar Sequence Beyonder Characteristics Conservation shares the same description as the one used by the Captain. Perhaps, the term he used came from Emperor Roselle.\nAccording to the two laws described by Mr. Gate, we can indeed deduce a lot of interesting speculations. For example, with there being so many holy artifacts and High-Sequence Beyonders in the Seven Churches, there shouldn't be many Low-Sequence Beyonders. But this contradicts reality, and the only reasonable explanation is an additional gift from the deities?\nFor example, is the destruction of the Nation of the Evernight due to the Conservation of Characteristics, that the mere possession of resources causes it to be in trouble? Or could it be said that their existence seriously weakens the potency of the Evernight pathway and threatens the position of the Goddess?\nFor example, theoretically speaking, certain Sealed Artifacts could also be used as the main ingredients for potion materials, or they can even be considered equivalent to potions. Of course, the prerequisite is to remove all latent dangers and madness.\n...\nNo wonder the documents that were unearthed called the Fourth Epoch, \"the Epoch of the Gods.\" So it turns out that in this epoch, there are many records of deities descending.\nThen what caused them to stop coming, to the point of there not being any revelations?\nIf it wasn't for the fact that Beyonders receive responses from ritualistic magic, perhaps many of them would've doubted the existence of the deities...\nMany ideas came to Klein suddenly as he felt that he had delved deeper into the realm of mysticism in this Beyonder world.\nHe flipped through the next four pages and was disappointed to realize that they were no longer related to Mr. Door.\nHis ability as a Clown allowed him to conceal his emotions well, and coupled with the gray fog's obstruction, even Audrey, who was secretly observing him, didn't notice anything amiss.\nHe gathered his chaotic thoughts and started reading the third page of the diary:\n\"10th September. I've endured it for a long time, but I still can't help but complain a little.\n\"I must've had f**king sh*t for brains to chose the Savant path, right?\n\"Of course, this has indeed allowed me to develop my greatest advantage, allowing the Church to attach great importance to me. But the problem is that the first few Sequences lack any Beyonder powers needed for combat. I can only make do by relying on mystical items and rely way too much on external items.\n\"For example, Sequence 9 Savant only has extraordinary abilities in memory, learning, and practical skills. For example, Sequence 8 Archaeologist gains a strong physique and corresponding ancient knowledge, and they can only barely apply some ritualistic magic. For example, Sequence 7 Appraiser, whose ability is to quickly identify mystical objects, allowing them to avoid hidden dangers to the greatest extent. For example, Sequence 6 Artisan, who can produce machinery wonder but not very powerful Beyonder objects. Apart from that, one's standard in ritualistic magic will be enhanced. It's no wonder its modern name is Machinery Specialist.\n\"Comparatively speaking, the Sequence 7 Warlock and Sequence 6 Scrolls Professor of the Mystery Pryer pathway are sufficiently tempting. It would be great if only the Church has the complete Sequence and that the Hidden Sage doesn't exist.\n\"However, I finally received some good news. After I advance again, I'll gain Beyonder powers combat powers that I can call my own. Sequence 5 Astromancer!\n\"Its modern name scares me a little. It's actually called Astronomer...\n\"Am I going to end up as an all-powerful mad scientist?\n\"Heavens have mercy on me. I was only a second-tier student at the college entrance examination!\nIt had to be said that Emperor Roselle had a strange talent for making jokes. Even the recently dispirited Klein couldn't help but twitch his mouth, wishing to light a candle for this senior.\nStudy hard and improve by the day is indeed a wise saying...He lampooned and remembered the unique trait of the Church of the God of Steam and Machinery.\nThey lacked Beyonder powers when it came to combat, but they were good at making and using items.\nAfter flipping to the third page of the diary, Klein continued reading.\n\"2nd June, the kingdom has created chaos, again and again, instigating wars without being able to completely destroy the Feysac Empire, the Loen Kingdom, and the Feynapotter Kingdom. As such, the kingdom has no choice but to shoulder huge debts, and its economy is on the verge of collapse.\n\"From my observations, the people, merchants, and soldiers are very dissatisfied. The riots are just lacking a spark! This is my chance.\n\"But I have to be very careful. The Sauron family has witnessed the history of the Fourth Epoch and is an ancient family with a high possibility of having High-Sequence Beyonders. I need the support of the Church, as well as gain a tacit agreement with the Church of the Eternal Blazing Sun.\n\"I can't appear immediately. First, I'll let the rebels destroy order before I end it all as a protector. Consul Roselle Gustav. I like that name.\"","13":"Howes Street, Divination Club.\nKlein pressed down on his half top hat and walked along the stairway towards the main door.\nHe wasn't dressed in his usual formal wear. Today, he was wearing a white shirt and a light-colored vest, paired with a thin black windbreaker, making him look more spirited than he had before.\nThis set of clothing was more suitable for combat and had only cost him one pound, including the fee for the small pocket that he had sewn into the vest. Compared to the suit he had purchased, it was so cheap that it brought tears to his eyes.\nHe stroked the revolver in his holster, as well as the metal bottles in his tiny inner pocket. Klein then took out the portrait and entered the Divination Club.\nWithout any surprise, he met the beautiful attendant, Angelica.\n\"Good afternoon, Mr. Moretti. I thought you would come only a few days later.\" Angelica was taken aback at first before she immediately revealed a brilliant smile.\nKlein took off his hat and sighed.\n\"Good afternoon, Miss Angelica. I had a dream at noon. I dreamed about Mr. Hanass Vincent and matters regarding him. You know that, as a fortune-teller, I absolutely cannot overlook any dream. It could be a revelation from the divine.\"\nConfused by his charlatan-like words, Angelica nodded in thought and asked out of curiosity, \"What did you dream of?\"\n\"I saw Hanass Vincent arguing with someone.\" Klein passed her the folded piece of paper in his hand.\nAs Angelica unfolded the portrait, he pinched his glabella and observed the color of her emotions.\n\"This person...\" Angelica looked at the realistic portrait and slipped into deep thought.\nKlein saw her emotions turn into a \u2018thinking blue', a normal reaction.\n\"This person...\" Angelica muttered once again. She slowly looked up and said, \"I've met him before.\"\nKlein's mind whirled as he immediately asked, \"When was it?\"\n\"I can't remember the exact date. Maybe a month ago? I saw him send Mr. Vincent to the door and they were softly discussing something. I have a deep impression of him because of his thick and messy eyebrows, as well as Mr. Vincent's rare smile,\" Angelica described as she recalled. \"Yes, he had a pair of grayish-blue eyes and, like most men his age, had little hair on his head.\"\n\"Did you meet him again before or after that?\" asked Klein gently.\nAngelica shook her head.\n\"No, I am certain of that. I don't even know his name. To be honest, if it wasn't you, I would have suspected that any person showing me a portrait like this is a policeman investigating Mr. Vincent's death. Heh, I don't find it odd no matter what revelation you receive, for you are a true Seer.\"\nMy apologies, I am a policeman...Klein retorted silently as he sighed and said, \"A true Seer would understand how minuscule he truly is compared to the vastness of fate. We can only see a hazy corner, forever receiving revelations, but never answers. We must reflect upon them constantly and keep up our respect and fear. We must decipher these hints with caution and not see ourselves as the intelligent ones who have taken control of fate.\"\nBy summarizing what he had figured out over the past few weeks, Klein suddenly realized that his Spirit Vision turned clearer. He could even faintly make out the details within Angelica's aura.\nAt that instant, he felt like a shortsighted man who was wearing glasses that suited him.\nThis... has my Seer potion begun to produce clear signs of digestion?Klein was stunned in disbelief.\n\"I never imagined that a Seer like you can still maintain such fear and respect towards fate. It's truly admirable,\" said Angelica earnestly.\nShe had seen too many people in the Divination Club who claimed to see through the truth and change fate after learning a few divination methods.\nKlein retracted his gaze and chuckled.\n\"The more you know, the better you can understand how small we truly are.\"\nAs he was saying this, he checked his body's condition and reflected on his past experiences. He could basically narrow the essence of the \u2018acting' technique to \u2018actions corresponding to the name of the potion, understanding the hidden laws governing the role, as well as strictly abiding by these laws'.\nOnly by doing so could he change the state of his body, heart, and soul, making them closer to the remnant psyche in the potion, so as to gradually digest it.\nThe acknowledgment of a Seer's identity was only a factor on the surface. The reason why it made one's spirituality feel light had to do with how the feedback strengthened one's affirmation of particular divination actions. And these actions collectively formed the rules for digesting the Seer potion.\nTo help others interpret revelations and guide them in a better direction; yet constantly maintain one's fear and respect towards fate. One cannot be too egoistical, too proud, or blindly believe one's interpretations... These are the laws I can think of for the time being, as well as the essence of the \u2018acting' technique that will guide me towards the future. If it continues to be this successful, I won't need half a year. Perhaps in two or three months, or even two to three weeks time, I'll be ready to completely digest the potion.\n... That sign was extremely obvious. It's no wonder the mysterious Mr. Zaratul said that the Beyonder will clearly sense it when the potion is fully digested. There's no need for anyone to teach them. It is what it is... Just like now, although my Spirit Vision has been enhanced a little, I know very well that this is only a pit stop in the digestion process and not the final destination.\nWith this in mind, Klein couldn't help but thank the suited clown for teaching him with his life!\nIf it wasn't for him, he would probably spend months at the Divination Club, summarizing the rules of a Seer through numerous attempts-for better or for worse-before he began \u2018acting' strictly.\n\"Mr. Moretti, I sometimes even think of you as a philosopher,\" Angelica said with a sigh upon hearing Klein's reply.\n\"In my circle of friends, the term \u2018philosopher' is used to scold somebody.\" Klein was in a good mood.\nWith that said, he bowed, wore his hat, and left after bidding farewell.\nAlthough Angelica was unaware of the gentleman's name or identity, Klein was in no way depressed. What he learned was sufficient enough for him to engage in the next phase of his plan.\n...\n36 Zouteland Street. Inside Blackthorn Security Company.\nDunn looked at the portrait in his hands with his deep gray eyes.\n\"You wish to carry out a search for this person?\"\n\"Yes.\" Klein had long prepared a reason for this. \"Captain, didn't I mention that I would head to the Divination Club to observe the reactions of its members on Hanass Vincent's sudden death? I didn't discover anything yesterday, but I accidentally found out today that the person in the portrait had appeared with Hanass Vincent once and was secretly discussing something with him. I flipped through our team's investigation report just now, but I didn't discover any person resembling him in the report.\"\nThere were no loopholes in his description. Even if Dunn Smith were to take this portrait to the Divination Club, he would get the same answer from Angelica.\nDunn cast his gaze away from the portrait and laughed.\n\"From the looks of it, the compensation funds weren't a waste.\"\n... Captain, isn't your memory bad? Why would you mention the compensation at this point in time...Klein maintained a smile and didn't say a word.\n\"Was this drawn by you?\" Dunn asked in passing.\n\"Yes. I drew it with the help of ritualistic magic,\" Klein replied, completely honest.\nOf course, speaking the truth and revealing the whole truth were two different matters.\nDunn nodded slightly and said, \"Get Old Neil to make a few more sets. I'll get Kenley and Royale to investigate and seek the cooperation of the police department. If this clue is of any use, you would've contributed greatly once again.\"\n\"May Goddess bless us.\" Klein tapped four spots on his chest as he appeared abnormally devout.\nFor him, all he needed from Dunn and company was to figure out the name and identity of the man in the portrait. He could divine his location above the gray fog!\n...\nDespite it being his day off, Klein didn't immediately return home after leaving the Blackthorn Security Company. Instead, he took the public carriage to the harbor and arrived in front of the Evil Dragon Bar's entrance.\nIn his considerations, although a Seer lacked the means to directly engage in combat with an enemy or the means to cast spells quickly, combat could be classified in many ways. Not all battles were chance encounters. As long as he had sufficient time to prepare, a Seer could similarly deal with an enemy using ritualistic magic. It was exactly how he resolved the magic mirror divination incident at Selena's house.\nAnd this also meant that it was best if a Seer brought along the essential oils, herbs, and tiny candles to avoid being in a situation where they were unavailable when they were needed most, thus, resulting in a helpless death. After all, not everyone was like Selena who had an entire assortment of mysticism items which could be used.\nAs for the ones he applied for, as Klein had practiced frequently, he had used up most of them. He kept what was left in his tiny inner pocket.\nHe patted the cash note in his pocket and pushed open Evil Dragon Bar's door and strode in.\nIt was noon and there weren't many customers in the bar. Nor were there any rat-baiting or boxing matches. It was quiet and not lively enough.\nKlein observed the guests drinking beer and playing cards as he walked toward the billiard room that led to the underground market.\nAt that moment, he saw a muscular old man walk out with a torn Admiral's jacket draped over his shoulders.\n\"Were you the friend Old Neil brought last time?\" Reeking with the smell of alcohol, the blue-eyed, messy brown-haired elder sized up Klein and laughed.\nKlein guessed at his identity and took off his hat and bowed.\n\"Yes, how might I address you?\"\n\"Old Neil often mentions you. I'm the boss here, Swain.\" The blue-eyed elder's arms were thick and brawny. He had firm muscles and had the bearing of a military officer.\nFormer Tingen Mandated Punisher Captain... Rumor has it that he was once part of the Royal Navy...Klein replied politely, \"Yes.\"\n\"If you're in need of money, feel free to approach me.\" Swain laughed as he mentioned before walking towards the bar counter.\nAt that moment, Klein's heart stirred as he immediately shouted, \"Wait a moment, Mr. Swain. I have something I would like to ask of you.\"\nSwain halted in his steps, turned halfway around, and said with a chuckle, \"You look, well-very similar.\"\nNo, I'm not having memory issues...The corner of Klein's lips twitched as he pointed at the portrait he drew and asked, \"Have you met this gentleman before?\"\nHe suddenly realized that Selena had likely been brought by Hanass Vincent to the underground market. This resulted in Elizabeth's knowledge of the Evil Dragon Bar as well. Then, could the man in the portrait who had some relationship with Hanass Vincent have come here before?\nSwain took a careful look and replied affirmatively, \"I remember him. He had asked me if I had documents or items related to the main peak of the Hornacis mountain range.\"\nDocuments and items related to the main peak of the Hornacis mountain range?Klein was taken aback as he suddenly connected that to another matter.\nBack when he was borrowing the journal issue related to the main peak of the Hornacis mountain range at Deweyville Library, the librarian had casually mentioned that someone had just returned it. Therefore, he still remembered very cleverly and didn't need to flip through his name cards to determine if the man existed.\nCould the gentleman who borrowed the journal issue before me be the one in the portrait?\nThe gentleman that had witnessed the exchange of the Antigonus family's notebook.","14":"Unable to tolerate the situation, Danitz decided to do something about the situation.\nHe coughed twice and faced Vice Admiral Iceberg Edwina Edwards and said, \"Captain, Mr. Gehrman Sparrow has some questions for you?\"\nPhew...Klein let out a sigh of relief.\nIf this stare down continued, he felt as though his persona would collapse.\nEdwina gently nodded her head, looked at Klein, and said, \"Mr. Sparrow, have you received education?\"\nWhat kind of question is this?Klein's expression didn't change as he indifferently replied, \"University graduate.\"\nAh?Danitz looked at Gehrman Sparrow in surprise, unable to believe the fact that this crazy adventurer and bounty hunter had actually gone to university and even graduated!\nHe had no way of putting a university-a hallmark of wisdom-with that of Gehrman Sparrow together!\nUnless it's some \"Hunter University\" or \"Killer Academy\"... Or a university that exists only in the fantasies of madmen and psychopaths...Danitz couldn't help but lampoon silently.\nEdwina didn't seem surprised. She continued to ask, \"What languages have you mastered?\"\n\"...\"\nKlein resisted the urge to frown and said, \"Jotun, Elvish, Dragonese, ancient Hermes, Hermes, ancient Feysac, Loenese...\"\nEdwina responded tersely.\n\"Do you understand the other domains in mysticism?\"\nFeeling adrift for a moment, Klein felt like he had returned to his previous life's elementary school days. Due to his age handicap, he had been asked a series of questions by a teacher, such as how many Chinese characters he had mastered, if he had mastered the four arithmetic operations, whether he knew the English alphabet, and how many Tang dynasty poems he could recite...\nCalm down... You're Gehrman Sparrow now...Klein once again said without emotion, \"Adept.\"\nEdwina thought for two seconds and then explained in an unhurried manner, \"I have to combine your standard of knowledge with how I would answer the questions so that you can understand the answers more easily.\"\nThis...Klein was surprised to find that the beautiful lady in front of him was nothing like an adventurer acting as a part-time pirate. She was basically a teacher with a cold expression but a kind and patient attitude.\nHe calmed down after thinking about the vampire that headed for the Church of Mother Earth daily.\nThis is the first pirate admiral I'm officially meeting. She's indeed unique...Klein secretly sighed and said, \"First question, where do Beyonder creatures appear at sea? The commonly seen ones.\"\nHe didn't directly ask about mermaids, as he didn't want her to see through his real purpose, which would lead to unnecessary accidents.\nEdwina thought for a moment and then wiped the \"Soulfall Ritual\" off the blackboard. She then wrote and drew:\n\"Set off from Sonia Island, sail 1,200 nautical miles in this direction and you'll enter the depths of the sea which humans have never explored.\n\"There is a Naga tribe active there. They've been working hard to find the underwater city which is rumored to have a powerful demon sealed within. That's the entity of their faith...\"\nEdwina spoke in detail, partly from her own efforts to find the treasure itself, and partly from the knowledge and rumors she had exchanged.\nIt took her awhile to finish the general story, but to Klein's dismay, there were no mermaids anywhere except in the eastern waters of the Gargas Archipelago.\nHe quickly calmed his mood and said, \"Second question, do you know how to remove the mental corruption from a Beyonder characteristic?\"\nHe didn't hide the fact that he knew about Beyonder characteristics.\nEdwina's eyes flickered for the first time, as though she had a new understanding of Gehrman Sparrow.\nShe shook her head.\n\"I don't know.\n\"However, I once imagined that it's possible by borrowing the power of an external force and completely crushing the corrupted Beyonder characteristic to reduce it to the smallest specks of light. This way, whether it's corrupted or cursed, they will scatter having lost their vessel. They would rapidly or slowly vanish. As for the shattered Beyonder characteristic, it will gather bit by bit due to their particular traits, eventually taking form again.\n\"Unfortunately, only gods can do this. If you get the favor of any god, you can try to please \u2018Them' by offering enough sacrifices and pray for a response.\"\nThe law of convergence of Beyonder characteristics...In his mind, Klein filled in what Edwina had purposely left out.\nAt the same time, he couldn't help but sigh. This Vice Admiral Iceberg, Captain of the Golden Dream, was extremely knowledgeable in mysticism. She wasn't worse than him, someone who had read many of Roselle's diary entries and had experienced many things.\nIt was said that Vice Admiral Iceberg can replicate or simulate the Beyonder powers of her opponents when they use them in front of her... This is rather similar to Mr. Isengard Stanton's 2-081 ring...As soon as Klein's thoughts began to wander, he forcefully reined them back, and he nodded as if he was thinking about something.\n\"I agree with this hypothesis.\"\n\"Regretfully, I haven't done it in practice. It's only a conjecture.\" Edwina rarely used a word that described emotion.\nDanitz, who had been listening by the side, had a dazed look on his face. He was unable to keep up with the conversation at all.\nWhat are they talking about? What are they discussing? Why do I know every word, but know nothing when they're strung together... What's a Beyonder characteristic? What does shattering it do? What does it gathering together represent?Danitz looked left and right, his eyes blank.\nAt this point, Klein threw out the third question he had thought about.\n\"Where can you find ancient wraiths?\"\nHe only mentioned this kind of monster because the corresponding ingredients could also be used in the domain of Death. It didn't expose the secrets of his own Sequence.\nEdwina glanced at Danitz and said, \"I'll keep an eye out for you.\n\"If you want to attend Bayam's Beyonder gatherings, he knows a few. He can take you there.\"\nNot bad, it's easier to talk to smart people...Klein added, \"Do you know where there are people who can make mystical items out of Beyonder ingredients or characteristics?\"\n\"I met one at a gathering, but he never showed up again,\" Edwina answered frankly. \"I have grasped the corresponding knowledge. I can simulate it, but I cannot guarantee the success rate.\"\nHeh heh... I'll wait then...Klein didn't harp on the topic and switched to asking, \"How much do you know about Death's Key?\"\n\"Little.\" An iron black key suddenly appeared in Edwina's hand. It was about the size of a lyre; its shape was ancient, and it had a dark luster.\nThe pirate admiral said while half-carrying the item from the shipwreck, \"If you mean this key, then I can tell you that it belongs to the giants.\"\nKlein glanced sideways at Danitz.\n\"Your boatswain told me that it can also belong to a dragon or a demonic wolf.\"\n\"That was the earliest guess. I've recently found some historical documents. And with the help of the other items on the ship, I have a rudimentary idea.\" Edwina didn't show any agitation. She was filled with patience, but her expression remained cold.\nAfter finally regaining his sense as the owner of the dream, Danitz curiously asked, \"Captain, is it really the giants'?\"\n\"Yes.\" Edwina gave an affirmative answer. \"That batch of documents showed that there were still many giants active in the Fourth Epoch. Some of them had switched faiths to the God of Combat, while the others were left scattered, becoming the hunting targets of the humans.\n\"One of the tribes built a ship and tried to find the lost Giant King's Court at sea, never to return. The sunken ship we discovered, along with some of the items inside, are very similar to the relics they left behind in their original settlement, so we have sufficient reason to believe that the key belongs to the giants, and it is very likely to be pointed towards the lost Giant King's Court of their race before the Cataclysm.\"\nGiant King's Court? Little Sun said it's not far from the City of Silver...Klein didn't say a word, but he quietly listened to Vice Admiral Iceberg's description.\nI have to say, the City of Silver and the Forsaken Land of the Gods are things I know that completely surpasses other Beyonders... Hmm, even the seven gods can't find that place, or they find it hard to figure out the exact situation. In this aspect, I'm stronger than \u2018Them'...Klein thought about it with a smug and self-deprecating manner before saying in a deep voice, \"If I offer a sufficient price, are you willing to sell the key?\"\n\"Of course, unless I acquire additional clues to the Giant King's Court.\" Edwina continued to speak at a moderate pace.\nVery good, if the Tarot Club organizes an expedition to the Giant King's Court one day, I will buy this key...Klein was about to ask the last question when he suddenly remembered the four adventurers.\nRelying on the power of the Dream Charm, he conjured the lady with greenish-gray eyes, who wore a man's shirt, and her three companions.\n\"Do you know them?\"\nEdwina took a glance and said almost without thinking, \"Leticia Dolera, an archaeologist and adventurer.\n\"Rumor has it that she's a member from the Moses Ascetic Order or the Element Dawn.\"\nMoses Ascetic Order... The ancient organization that believes in the Hidden Sage... It really isn't for money, and their goal is definitely something from the abandoned temple...Klein asked casually, \"What do you know about Element Dawn?\"\nThis mysterious organization was similar to the Psychology Alchemists, having been born in the recent one to two hundred years. It combined the elements of various schools of mysticism. It had its own set of theories, and its members were all proficient in spell casting and had mastery in many ancient witchcraft techniques.\nEdwina pursed her lips and said, \"They've always been fighting against the Moses Ascetic Order.\n\"Rumor has it that the eldest daughter of Emperor Roselle, Bernadette Gustav, established it.\"\nThe Element Dawn is headed by Bernadette? Zaratul's prophecy is quite accurate after all. She can really be considered an important figure in the Beyonder world...Klein sighed inwardly, feeling somewhat enlightened.\nHe resisted the urge to sigh and looked at Edwina. He calmly said, \"One last question.\"\nWhen the beautiful lady and Blazing Danitz's attention was fully focused on him, he slowly opened his mouth.\n\"Are you interested in cooperating?\"\n\"What kind of cooperation?\" Edwina returned with a question.\nThe smile on Klein's face became more and more exuberant, with a hint of madness in it he said, \"Hunt Admiral of Blood.\"","15":"After a full half hour of uninterrupted silence, Klein opened his eyes and slowly rose to his feet.\nHe took his cane, put on his hat, and left the cathedral, taking a rental carriage back to Minsk Street in the dark.\nAt this moment, the vigilance and surveillance of the surrounding area had inevitably relaxed, turning into the shadows under the light of the gas lamps.\nShortly after midnight, Klein took out his key, opened the door to his house, and entered the empty guest rooms to search for the Book of Secrets.\nIt didn't take him much effort to find the old book, bound in thick goatskin, in the wardrobe in a room on the first floor.\nThe hardcover of the book was dark black, with two lines of Hermes written in crimson:\n\"Book of Secrets.\n\"Klarman.\"\nPhew...Klein exhaled but was in no rush to read the book. Instead, he quickly constructed a wall of spirituality in the room, summoning and responding to himself via a ritual, and then he threw Azik's copper whistle, the Master Key, the All-Black Eye, the Beyonder bullets, the bottle of biological poison, the Werewolf Beyonder characteristic, the Book of Secrets, and even all the vessels above the gray fog. He planned on waiting for the commotion to subside before deciding on which to take out and which to carry.\nAfter doing all this, he didn't even bother to study the Werewolf Beyonder characteristic or the bottle of biological poison. He simply washed up and laid in bed.\nThere were two reasons for doing so. Firstly, reading the book was too time consuming. It was very easy to bring trouble to his body in the real world on this rather uncalm night. Secondly, Klein was aware of his current weakness, which was that the speed at which his spirituality was growing wasn't enough to satisfy his ever-increasing Beyonder powers and mystical items.\nAfter such an intense battle, his spirituality was already drained. His head was aching, and he was drowsy.\nYes, the one thing that places the greatest burden on my spirituality are the Paper Figurine Substitutes, followed by the creation of \"Sun Holy Water\" with the Sun Brooch, but it wasn't used tonight. Next in the list is Holy Water Creation and Flaming Jump...Klein yawned and used Cogitation to get rid of the state of extreme tiredness and tenseness that prevented him from falling asleep.\nIn less than ten seconds, he entered the land of dreams as various fragmented scenes appeared alternately before him.\n...\nIn the clearing surrounded by the abandoned warehouses, the Machinery Hivemind came and went before coming again. The person in charge of investigating this incident went from being a team captain to an expert at the rank of deacon.\nIkanser Bernard's brown hair remained unkempt and stuck out stubbornly, making it impossible to hide them even with a hat on.\nThis led to many members of the Machinery Hivemind to secretly joke that the deacon probably used a bomb to style his hair.\nAt this moment, Ikanser, with his cut jaw and facial features, was holding a silver mirror with ancient patterns on it.\nOn each side of the mirror was an eye-like ornament. They were built on the foundation of a black gem which looked serene and charming.\nIkanser surveyed the area and said, \"Although the rats in the sewers are experts at interfering with divination and mediumship and had already dealt with the scene effectively, this is a mysterious Beyonder world, and there is no way to guarantee a one hundred percent success.\"\nAs he spoke, he looked at the silver mirror in his hand as he used his right hand to touch its surface thrice.\nAfter pausing for two seconds, Ikanser took a deep breath and said in a deep voice, \"Respected Arrodes, my question is \u2018Who were the participants in the incident that just happened here?'\"\nThe surrounding darkness suddenly thickened, and the surface of the silver mirror began to ripple with aqueous light.\nSoon, a scene appeared in the silver mirror.\nAmidst the rising flames, there was a figure floating in the air. He was wearing a black double-breasted frock coat and a half top hat. His body was distorted, and his face was indistinct. Furthermore, his face was smeared with paint.\nBeneath his feet, flames rose up and engulfed him.\nAs the aqueous light flashed, the scene changed. A middle-aged man in a dark red cloak appeared. His arm was burning with resplendent flames, but his head was hidden in the darkness.\nScene after scene was played out in front of their eyes. They saw a woman with a complicated black regal dress and messy blonde hair. However, her face was completely transparent, as if she didn't exist.\nBeside this lady were two men with black fur all over their bodies. Only their backs could be seen as they were being pulled by strange arms.\nFinally, the changes came to an end as it fixed onto the blazing flames that soared into the sky. The \"fireworks\" bloomed in a splendid and resplendent fashion as they lit up the entire scene.\nIn this dreamlike scene, the man in the black double-breasted frock coat appeared once again.\nTwisting and retracting, he faced forward, pressed his hat to his chest, and bowed slightly.\nNot only was his face extremely blurry after being interfered with, but it also presented a glisten of oil.\nJust as Ikanser was about to ask his teammates for their opinions, several lines of text in ancient Feysac appeared on the surface of the mirror.\n\"Based on the principle of reciprocity, it's my turn to ask the question.\n\"If you answer wrong or lie, you will be punished.\"\nThe word \"punishment\" was blood-red, as if it were dripping with liquid!\nThe expression on Ikanser's face was twisted at first before it turned abnormally serious.\nSoon after, the mirror's aqueous light flashed and a new line of text appeared.\n\"What's your sexual orientation?\"\nIkanser was stunned as he felt the gazes of his surrounding team members all land on him.\n...\nSix in the morning. The sky was just beginning to brighten.\nThe sleeping Klein awoke to the punctual church bells.\nAccording to his usual habits, he would just turn around and continue sleeping until it was almost 8 o'clock. But this time, he immediately sat up and looked around.\n\"Yeah, I didn't get raided on the pretext of checking my gas meter...\" He let out a sigh of relief, and without even bothering to clean himself, he got off the bed and took four steps counterclockwise to go above the gray fog.\nHe wanted to study his spoils from last night!\nSitting in The Fool's seat, Klein started from the simplest.\nHe picked up the dark-green fang and observed it for a few seconds. Then, he conjured a pen and paper and wrote the divination sentence: \"Its effects.\"\nThis didn't mean that divination could be used as a substitute for experimentation. With the fact that he held the item in his possession, and how he knew a lot about Prisoner, Lunatic, and Werewolf from Sharron and Maric, he believed that it was enough for him to attempt to gain some revelations from it.\nAfter reciting the statement, he quickly entered the dreamland and witnessed one scene after another.\nA vicious wound appeared on Werewolf Tyre's stomach, and his intestines flowed out as they were dragged across the ground. However, he only washed it with water and stuffed the intestines back into his stomach. He pinched both sides of the wound, and in the end, the wound actually healed...\nUnder the perfect red moon, he faced the sky and let out a long howl. Black fur grew out of his body, inch by inch, and the fangs in his mouth were distinct...\nHe waved his claws and cracked the steel plate that wasn't considered thin...\nHe ran wildly through the wilderness, increasing the gap between him and the group of pursuing gray wolves as he ran further and further away...\nHe made the attendants, whose eyes were glazed but cold, charge at their enemies without fear of death...\nHe also used a variety of weapons to kill people, including bombs, and he became stronger as he lost his reasoning while in his enraged state...\n...\nOpening his eyes, Klein roughly understood the characteristics of a Werewolf and grasped the hidden dangers of this Beyonder characteristic.\nWerewolf Tyre had been under the full moon's illumination, allowing him to be unrestrained towards his desires. After his death, he left a relatively strong spiritual mark, so those Beyonders, who would use this Beyonder characteristic to concoct a potion to advance themselves to the next Sequence, had to resist this kind of effect at an early stage; otherwise, they would show signs of losing control.\nHowever, the negative effects had yet to reach the level of a Sealed Artifact, and the Beyonder characteristic left behind by the Werewolf could still be used as the main ingredient for a potion.\nThat's good... Unfortunately, Zombie Jack's Beyonder characteristic has been swallowed by that strange door... I wonder where it leads to and if there's a way to get it back...Klein put down the dark-green fang, feeling both regret and sadness for his loss, before picking up the bottom of brown translucent biological poison.\nHe repeated the same procedure and performed a dream divination, but this time he didn't have the confidence to gain a detailed revelation. Therefore, he changed the divination statement to: \"Its positive and negative effects.\"\nIn the gray gloom of the dream world, Klein once again saw tragic scenes.\nSomeone fell to the ground, scratching himself and ripping off his skin, flesh, and even bones...\nAnother person held his head, his eyes losing focus while his auras weakened...\nOne kept vomiting. Towards the end, the person who died was convulsing...\nSomeone burst out laughing, laughing so hard that he couldn't even breathe...\nSome people stopped fighting and looked at each other. Then, they hugged and kissed each other...\nWhen the scene reached the end, the translucent brown bottle was placed into a cup with water. The transparent liquid inside gradually turned amber in color and was drunk... The person holding onto the bottle of biological poison was weakened at first before coughing. Then, he touched his forehead. He found himself scalding as his condition turned for the worse...\nThe dream quickly ended. Klein tapped his finger on the edge of the long table as he attempted to interpret the revelation with great difficulty.\nAccording to Steve, the earlier revelations mean that after the biological poison's bottle lid is removed, it would keep emanating its poison. As for which poison the opponents gets inflicted by, it's completely random, and even the wielder is unable to control it? The poison inside is really quite abominable...\nThe effective range of the poison cannot be deciphered via a revelation... Hmm, soaking it in water and drinking the amber liquid in advance would prevent one from getting poisoned? But how many minutes should the soaking take? Even if the person holding the Biological Poison Bottle doesn't open the lid, their bodies would get worse as they slowly get infected, and the ailments become serious? Uh, what's the exact cut-off time?\nKlein rubbed his forehead, intending to do some experiments above the gray fog when he was free, but he didn't know if the Biological Poison Bottle was effective in there.\nFor example, in his current Spirit Body state, he wasn't afraid of being poisoned at all.\nI'll leave it at this. I'll study it in detail in the future...Klein turned his attention to the Book of Secrets, which was bound in goatskin. He then casually flipped to the first page.\nIt was a title page with simple patterns on it but with nothing written on it...\nFlipping another page, Klein finally saw the opening line of the Book of Secrets: \"We worship the moon, not the Evernight Goddess.\"","16":"In the blink of an eye, Amon saw the grayish-white fog and the ancient and majestic palace above.\n\"He\" just needed to reach out \"His\" hand and pass through the final obstacle to truly touch Sefirah Castle and directly occupy the place and, in essence, take it away.\nBut at that moment, a gigantic bluish-black palm suddenly appeared above the Amon phantom, blocking \"Him\" from entering Sefirah Castle.\nAmon's projection subconsciously turned its head and looked in the direction of the palm. It saw the pus-covered, one-eyed giant who had long since died.\nBladel, who was known as the God of Glory, still didn't show any signs of life in \"His\" exaggerated vertical eye. The curse of the grayish-yellow fog kept emanating from \"His\" body.\nHowever, it was different from before. There were seemingly illusory black tubes behind \"His\" back. They extended all the way into the infinite distance, a mystery as to what they were connected to.\nBoom!Read latest chapters at L istnovel\nThe towering bluish-black giant instantly condensed a broadsword formed from the orange-red light of dusk. Holding it in one hand, \"He\" cleaved down at the side of the deep ravine where Amon's body was.\nThis youngest son of the Giant King, the one who had died due to the curse, suddenly unleashed an unimaginable power after roaming aimlessly for thousands of years.\nThe \"Twilight Sword\" tore through the void and jumped out from the spot where the Angel of Time, Amon, was standing. It ripped through everything around it, turning into a storm that could destroy this desolate moor.\nAmon didn't move and remained standing there. No matter how the orange-red \"sword\" storm raged, it didn't harm \"Him\" at all.\n\"He\" seemed to have used some sort of \"error\" in this world again.\nHowever, in this state, Amon was no longer able to transmit \"His\" ravings into Klein's mind, allowing him to finally gain a sliver of peace.\nIgnoring how he was about to lose control, he regained his clarity of mind using the clear and real surroundings and the layers of prayer. Then, he immediately resonated with the dark red \"figure\" sitting at The Fool's seat above the gray fog, and he established a new connection.\nHe didn't hesitate to return to Sefirah Castle!\nAnd at this moment, Amon's phantom, which was attempting to infiltrate above the gray fog, was obstructed by the bluish-black palm of the God of Glory, Bladel. \"He\" wasn't able to instantly break through the titanic obstruction.\nThe monocled King of Angels, be it \"His\" avatar or true body, opened \"His\" mouth and said a name, \"Evernight.\"\nYes, this was help coming from the Evernight Goddess, but it wasn't without reason!\nAlthough Klein lacked confidence in this matter, he had always kept it as one of his trump cards. He only believed that it might not be effective and had a very low chance of success. It could only be used as a glimmer of hope at his most desperate hour.\nAfter entering the Forsaken Land of the Gods and obtaining some space to think on his own, he worked hard to find \"resources\" available to him that could be used. Then, he recalled something:\nThe matter of the former Chief of the City of Silver!\nThis Demon Hunter had attempted to switch to Sequence 3 Ferryman of the Death pathway, but he ended up turning into a monster inside the mausoleum he built.\nThis anomaly was related to illusory black tubes, and such a phenomenon had been seen from the Numinous Sect's Artificial Death.\nIn other words, the mutation of the former Chief of the City of Silver was very likely related to Artificial Death.\nThis indirectly explained something-that for some unknown reason, those that could influence the Forsaken Land of the Gods, other than the True Creator, included Artificial Death who had come to \"life\" to a certain level.\nAnd now, Artificial Death could be considered the Evernight Goddess in some ways!\nBased on this reasoning, Klein suspected that the Goddess could use the Uniqueness of the Death pathway to exert a low level of influence to some degree on certain things in the Forsaken Land of the Gods.\nIn addition, there were only three people involved in the matter regarding the former Chief of the City of Silver. One of them was the current Chief, Colin Iliad; the demigod Elder, Waite Chirmont, and Shepherd Elder, Lovia. They were either Sequence 4 saints or an important believer of the True Creator. It was impossible for them to be completely unaware that they had been \"parasitized\" by Amon.\nAs for the only person who received feedback from the escapade, it was Derrick Berg who was under The Fool's watch. He wasn't one of Amon's \"Parasites\" either.\nIn other words, Amon wasn't aware of the former City of Silver Chief's abnormality involving the black illusory tubes. That was key.\nTherefore, even if \"He\" was able to guess that the Evernight Goddess had obtained the Uniqueness of the Death pathway, causing the God of Combat to have an intense reaction, there was no way for \"Him\" to know that this would bring about unforeseen developments to the Forsaken Land of the Gods.\nWith this knowledge in mind, Klein consciously performed certain tasks, despite not having much confidence.\nIn the city that believed in the phoenix, he didn't take away the remaining Death pathway's Beyonder characteristics, hoping to leave a trail.\nAfter summoning Zaratul's historical projection, he didn't seize the opportunity to commit suicide immediately. On the one hand, he was afraid that Amon would still have the ability to stop him and affect his other arrangements; while on the other hand, he tried to use the summoning of the Servant of Concealment Arianna's projection to inform the Evernight Goddess about the exact situation.\nAfter completing these two matters, Klein had no idea what the final outcome would be. He had mostly focused his attention on the fact that Amon's avatar had been replaced by \"His\" true body.\nWhen he arrived at his final destination and saw the roaming angel's corpse, he had just thought of something when he was distracted by Amon's introduction. It took him only until now to realize that the Goddess had long gained some rudimentary control of this Giant King's youngest son through the Death pathway's Uniqueness. \"She\" had been patiently waiting for an opportunity to use this cursed angel.\nAnd the concealment forces that filled the Forsaken Land of the Gods helped \"Her\" conceal the illusory black tubes very well.\nSuddenly, in the ancient palace above the gray fog, at The Fool's seat situated at the end of the long, mottled table, the dark red figure that kept warping and scattering took the form of the scholarly Klein with his black hair and brown eyes.\nWith just a thought, Klein's consciousness and Spirit Body had returned to Sefirah Castle!\nFollowing that, he used the close connection between his body and Sefirah Castle, together with the prayers of the Tarot Club members, to amplify the resonance effect. He then saw himself-glazed eyes, on the brink of losing control. He saw Amon's projection which had circled around the bluish-black palm using an \"error.\"\nThe monocled Amon raised \"His\" head, making eye contact with Klein, who was seated at The Fool's seat.\nKlein beckoned for the Sea God Scepter and raised it.\nThe entire gray fog boiled as the entirety of Sefirah Castle quaked.\nA vast amount of terrifying power gathered over, transforming into a torrent of lightning. The blue gems that lit up at the same time sent an illuminating light that surged down like a torrent, drowning Amon's avatars and his own body.\nA deep rumble of thunder echoed as the terrifying silver lightning tore everything it enveloped apart.\nAmon's projection disintegrated, and Klein's body was destroyed.\nHe had finally succeeded in committing suicide.\nAfter completing this attack, Klein, who was high above the gray fog, immediately cut off the connection between Sefirah Castle and the real world, so as to prevent Amon's true body from creating any new accidents.\nRight on the heels of that, he began to wait for the \"miracle\" and waited for his \"resurrection.\"\nBeside the deep ravine which had grayish-white buildings at the bottom, Amon's true body adjusted the crystal monocle, stealing the curse that kept Bladel \"existing.\"\nThe bluish-black giant immediately began to rot, quickly being reduced to bones. The illusory black tubes didn't persist, and they instead shrank back into the depths of the darkness.\nDressed in a pointed hat and a classic black robe, Amon stood there. \"He\" raised \"His\" head and looked into the sky silently for a few seconds, as though he was looking at Sefirah Castle through the fog of history.\nFinally, \"He\" pinched the crystal monocle and muttered to \"Himself\" as the corners of \"His\" mouth curled up.\n\"Interesting.\"\n...\nIn the ancient palace, at the end of the long, mottled table, Klein sat at the seat belonging to The Fool. He carefully looked down at the grayish-white fog.\nHe discovered that the Beyonder characteristics that had been destroyed with his body had unknowingly entered the Historical Void. It fused with the Worms of Spirit from the past, turning them corporeal.\nAs long as Klein willed it from Sefirah Castle, these Worms of Spirit would immediately be able to escape the fog of history and reform his body in the real world.\nThe miracle of \"resurrection\" was essentially a deeper use of one's strength from the past.\n\"Miracles\" happen using the past and future? Klein frowned slightly as he attempted to analyze how the \"Miracle\" in Miracle Invoker came about.\nAfter thinking for a few seconds, he quickly pulled his attention back and attempted to revive himself in Sefirah Castle. Then, he discovered a problem:\nHis body could only be revived in the real world. Furthermore, it had to be within a certain range of his remains. As for his Spirit Body, it could be reborn above the gray fog, but Klein's Spirit Body hadn't been destroyed-it was sitting on the high-back chair of The Fool.\nObtaining help from the past works. The number of resurrections I'm using now is depleting the number I'll have after I become a Miracle Invoker... From the looks of it, there's only one chance now. Tsk... Amon should be guarding my \"corpse\" now. I have to think of a way to get out of this predicament...\"His\" sense of time is different from a human's. He's a very patient God of Mischief... Yes, my current state can only be maintained for three days. After that period of time, I won't be able to borrow powers from the past to resurrect... If it really doesn't work, I'll just abandon my body and become an undead! Klein's mind raced. Although he was somewhat vexed, he was in his most relaxed state over the past few days.\nHe finally got out of that nearly hopeless situation.\nHe looked at the high-back chairs that had symbols light up on their backs, as well as the burgeoning and contracting dark red stars. Klein exhaled and relaxed as he leaned back into his chair. He couldn't help but reveal a smile.\n\"These are my anchors.\"\nAuthor's Note: This arc has finally come to an end. The whole story's origins was when I was reading the Cthulhu myth. When I saw the line about the stars being right, I suddenly thought of this: We often say that Cthulhu will awaken soon, but what happens if Cthulhu has already awakened...? For those who don't know much about Cthulhu, it doesn't matter. Just treat this name as an evil god. After all, the corresponding deities were completely reconstructed by me.","17":"\"No, it's just good luck. God was watching over me.\" Klein modestly stepped aside and invited Stuart in.\nWhat he said was the truth, and this matter did involve good luck. Long before Stuart had accepted the mission, he already knew of Emlyn White's whereabouts.\nStewart shivered as he took off his coat and hat and hung them on a rack in the hall.\n\"The darn weather is getting colder. Perhaps I should try using those coats with cotton stuffed inside them,\" he said.\n\"You can't call this cold, right? If you go to the north of Midseashire and live in Winter County for a day, you'll understand what truly low temperatures and true winter are like.\" Klein chuckled.\nThen, he generously asked, \"A cup of hot coffee?\"\n\"I would love one.\" Stuart followed him to the activity room on the first floor. \"I've been to north Midseashire, and I know about the cold and the snow there. It was a nice vacation, but Backlund's cold isn't inferior either. It went through my clothes like magic and seeped into my bones. Oh, what a wonderful fireplace!\"\nStuart stood in front of the burning fireplace for twenty seconds before he sat down on the sofa. He looked at Klein, who was busy brewing instant coffee, and he said, \"I'm going south for a holiday to go fishing at Desi Bay for new year's. What about you? Do you have any vacation plans? We put up with Backlund's air for a year and work hard to save money, all for such a holiday.\"\n\"Perhaps, I should head to Desi Bay as well...\" Klein said hesitantly. He turned his head to the side of Stuart's face, and for a moment, he seemed to be in a trance.\nThis involved an agreement.\nAn appointment with his elder brother, Benson, and sister, Melissa.\n\"Haha, I'll show you my fishing skills when the time comes.\" Stuart continued without end, \"We still aren't rich enough, otherwise I'd like to travel to Feysac, Intis, and even to the Southern Continent.\"\nAfter he finished making the coffee, Klein handed the man a white porcelain cup. He took two steps back and sat down across from him.\nHolding the cup in his hand, Stuart took two deep breaths of the fragrant and warm steam.\nAfter resting for a few seconds, he put the cup down and said very formally, \"According to our agreement, I'll share the reward I received this time with you.\n\"The Whites gave a total of fifty pounds, and you obviously did more than I did.\n\"Sherlock, how about thirty pounds? I still have to pay my informants for their work.\"\nOnly fifty pounds? A vampire is only worth fifty pounds?Klein couldn't help but silently lampoon.\nBut he also knew that it wasn't that the Whites didn't want to increase the bounty; it was because they were worried about giving too much money and scaring the detectives into making unnecessary associations, attracting the attention of the police or some official Beyonder organization.\nTo the average private detective, a fifty-pound mission was already tempting enough, and Klein had only used seven pounds back then to hire detectives to investigate all the red chimney houses in the whole of Tingen City and the towns along its outskirts.\n\"In addition, the Whites gave you an extra pound, claiming its for your transportation expenses for the past few days.\" Looking somewhat puzzled, Stuart produced six five-pound notes and one one-pound note.\nKlein reached out to take them, casually checked their authenticity and didn't explain the transportation fees.\nStuart didn't ask any further questions and instead said with a smile, \"Apart from Mr. Stanton, you're the best detective I've ever met. Did you join this profession midway, or have you studied under a great detective prior to this?\"\nWhat great detective have I studied under? There's quite a number. There's Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot, the forever elementary school\u00a0student1, and that guy who swindles others in the name of his\u00a0grandfather2...Klein silently lampooned.\nHe thought and said, \"I come from Midseashire, and I did various jobs before I became a detective.\"\n\"That's why you're so rich in knowledge and experience!\" Stuart said in enlightenment.\nHey, I'm a bit embarrassed by your flattery...Klein smiled but didn't respond.\nStuart took a sip of his coffee and said, \"Sherlock, I hope you can provide me with help in the future if I encounter a difficult case that I'm unable to solve.\"\nMy social connections in the detective circles have widened...Klein replied cautiously, \"If I have the time when the time comes.\"\nAfter some idle conversation, Stuart tactfully offered to take his leave, and Klein accompanied him to the door.\nAfter putting on his coat and hat, Stuart was about to open the door and leave when he suddenly turned around and sincerely said, \"Sherlock, you live too simply.\n\"Your talent deserves better coffee.\"\nAh?Klein was stunned for a moment, but then he immediately felt a bit embarrassed.\nHe laughed dryly and said, \"I can't tell the quality of the coffee. It's all the same to me.\"\n...\nAfter sending Stuart off, Klein went to the butcher's to buy a few ox bones and some beef. He went to the vegetable shop to buy some ingredients such as white radish, rounding up all the required condiments.\nHe wanted to prepare beef bone radish soup for dinner and eat it with the leftover rice. As for noon, he found a random restaurant on the streets and ate a small serving of lamb chop.\nAfter a leisurely afternoon, Klein continued to study the Book of Secrets, and the more he read, the more he realized that he knew little about mysticism.\nFortunately, he had a solid foundation. He quickly grasped many things once he came into contact with them and pondered over them.\nIn the evening, he smelled the tantalizing fragrance of the beef bone soup, and his Adam's apple bobbed up and down twice.\nHe heard the doorbell again, as though it was a bugle to signal dinner time.\nGulping down his saliva, Klein walked behind the door and reached for the handle.\nThe image of the visitor naturally appeared in his mind. It was the handsome but not masculine red-eyed vampire, Emlyn White.\nThere's no need to rush him at all... What a man of his word...Klein opened the door and smiled.\n\"Good evening, Mr. White\"\nEmlyn raised his chin, letting his impatience show in his expression.\nHe was about to say something when Klein looked at his brown clerical robes and said with a knowing smile, \"You just came over from the Harvest Church?\"\nWho was the one who said he could resist last night?\nUnable to maintain his gentlemanly demeanor, Emlyn gritted his teeth and said, \"That old man, that old man...\n\"Dammit, how do I get rid of this inducing suggestion?\"\nBefore Klein could reply, he patted the clothes on his chest and said with a stern face, \"Take me to the patient.\n\"There's a good dinner waiting for me.\"\nAs he spoke, he sniffed indiscernibly, as if he had smelled something.\nKlein picked up his coat and hat without saying another word.\n\"Alright, I'll take you there now.\"\nAfter closing the door and taking a few steps, he cautiously asked, \"Do you have a certificate to practice medicine?\"\nHow else am I supposed to convince Lawyer Jurgen to allow Mrs. Doris to take the medicine?\nEmlyn looked up at the sky at a forty-five-degree angle and said, \"I don't need those papers to prove my abilities.\"\nBefore Klein frowned, he casually added, \"It's too simple. I obtained it easily by going through the process.\"\n... This tone makes it sounds like he's rather proud of receiving a certificate for practicing medicine...Klein smiled without a word.\nLooking at the wet ground in front of him, Emlyn casually said, \"Do you know what I like most about Backlund?\"\n\"What?\" Klein responded without any curiosity.\nEmlyn chuckled and said, \"The persistent gloomy sky with fog that blots out the sun. This allows me to go out during the day without feeling too much discomfort.\n\"It's great, except for the air.\"\nIn other words, the sun really would deal certain damage to vampires? Fortunately, I thought of this yesterday and didn't bring the Sun Brooch with me; otherwise, I wouldn't be able to communicate with Emlyn...Klein seemed to gain an understanding.\nAs they conversed, they had already arrived outside the Jurgens, and Klein went up to ring the doorbell.\nAfter a while, the door opened, and Mrs. Doris, who was dressed thickly at home, said with pleasant surprise, \"Mr. Detective, I wasn't expecting you?\"\nBrody the black cat crouched to the side, looking at Emlyn warily, as though it felt that something was amiss about him.\nKlein pointed to the vampire beside him.\n\"I became acquainted with a doctor who's good at treating lung diseases, so I've asked him to come and give you a checkup. Let me do the introductions. This is Dr. Emlyn White.\"\n\"Is that so? You still actually remembered this? What a good child!\" Doris happily invited the two inside.\nChild...Klein's mouth twitched, but he didn't say anything in the end.\nOn the way into the living room, Emlyn whispered, \"The patient's problems are irreversible. She's very old and rather weak.\n\"Even if I give her the medicine, she would only be able to live through this winter. She would pass away in three to five years.\n\"Unless she's given an immortal potion or the like as spoken in the legends, that's all that can be done. Or should I turn her into a Sanguine? But at her age, she can no longer endure the changes a Beyonder characteristic can do to her body. Furthermore, my parents and I don't have any excess characteristics left.\"\nIrreversible...Klein was startled and silently sighed.\nHe said to Emlyn, \"Make her the medicine first. We'll leave that to after the winter.\"\n\"Alright, I have a type of ready-made medicine with me that's suitable for this kind of situation.\" Emlyn didn't stand on ceremony as he sat down on the sofa.\nAt that moment, Lawyer Jurgen was walking out of the kitchen as he took off his apron. He asked Klein about the purpose of his visit.\n\"Dr. White, what do you think of my grandmother's lung disease?\" Jurgen asked seriously.\nEmlyn was obviously very experienced in such situations. He first explained the ins and outs of lung disease, and after most of it flew past Jurgen's head, he said, \"What she needs most is warm and healthy air. That's my most sincere advice.\n\"In addition, I have special medicine that she can take for free.\"\nAs he spoke, he took out his certificate and a small metal bottle.\n\"Will there be any side effects?\" Jurgen asked cautiously.\n\"No, the only problem is that it can't cure the root of the problem completely; it's just a temporary cure,\" Emlyn replied in a very professional manner. \"If it weren't for Detective Moriarty, I wouldn't let anyone try it.\"\n\"Perhaps I can give it a try? Cough...\" Mrs. Doris interrupted.\nJurgen glanced at Klein who, having performed a divination prior to this, nodded affirmatively.\n\"Alright.\" Jurgen finally made his decision.\nHe watched warily as Mrs. Doris drank the bottle of medicine and carefully observed her reaction.\nThere wasn't much change to Mrs. Doris at first, but she gradually began to feel her breathing lighten.\nShe stood up and bent down to pick up the cat. She happily said, \"I feel much better!\"\nSeeing this scene, Jurgen's usually stoic face had his lips curl up slightly.\nHowever, Klein was thinking about the three to five years.\nHe curled a smile and sighed to himself.\nThis can also be considered a type of magic show, I guess. Using Beyonder powers to create fake outcomes to make the audience happy...","18":"This...The Second Epoch's subsidiary gods truly are hidden powers. There was Dragon of Wisdom, Herabergen\uff0cand there's God of the Dead, Salinger. They were all powerful figures that even reached the throne of Sequence 0. Of course, I can't be sure about the Dragon of Wisdom. It's just quite possible...\nYes, and there's the God of Dawn, Badheil, and the Goddess of Harvest, Omebella. I can't rule out the possibility that \"They\" have lived quite well all the way to the Fifth Epoch... I wonder if the God of Spiritual Creatures Tolzna and the Goddess of Misfortune Amanises managed to evade the authority retrieval operation by the City of Silver Creator at the end of the Second Epoch. If \"They\" managed to escape that fate, what roles did \"They\" play in the Third and Fourth Epoch? After a moment of shock, Klein began thinking poignantly.\nThinking back to the betrayal of the Kings of Angels in the Third Epoch, he couldn't help but lampoon:\nYou have to be careful of fire, theft, and subsidiary gods!\nAt that moment, Audrey, who didn't know much about the subsidiary gods' true names or authorities, didn't show any perturbations in her emotions. She acted as different female elves in Siatas's memories, and she constantly talked to her about her experiences and things she knew about the Second Epoch.\nAccording to Siatas, in the history of the elves, there was no concept of the First Epoch or Second Epoch. In the beginning years that were unknown to her, it was chaotic, dark, and crazy, and it didn't leave behind any texts. After the supernatural races obtained a certain level of intelligence and had their own languages, creatures finally had some knowledge of history.\nIn that era, ancient gods appeared one after another. The sky, the land, the sea, and the underground world slowly changed from disorderliness to orderliness. However, other than the tyrannical and crazy ancient gods, no one knew how many years this stage lasted. She just knew that, very, very long ago, it was referred to by the major supernatural races as the \"Sprouting Era.\"\nAfter the \"Sprouting Era\" was the \"Early Era of Fire\" in which the eight ancient gods fought against each other in different camps. This was also a long time before Siatas's birth, so she could only understand this from the elven historical records that it was a time when quasi-humans fought non-humans, resisting the corruption and intrusion from the devils and demonic wolves. Amongst them, the humanoids were the giants, elves, Sanguine, as well as their slaves.\nThe \"Early Era of Fire\" lasted different periods of time according to the different records. However, a common point was that it lasted less than a thousand years, as the essence of the ancient gods was madness, tyranny, cruel, and cold. They were often driven by their instinct.\nAfter the Sanguine Ancestor Lilith, Mutant King Kvastir, and Annihilation Demonic Wolf Flegrea perished during the betrayal, the \"E3rly Elm of Fire\" ended, and the war broke out \"The world was damaged, and it didiVt stop for centuries.\nDue to the fact that the giants and dragons were relatively strong in this period of time, they were known as the \"Dual Era.\"\nBy the time the five races formed a new balance of powers, the Northern Continent, the Southern Continent, the East Continent, and the Five Seas had recovered some level of peace. This was when Siatas was born and had grown up in until she entered Groselle's Travels.\nIn the history that she described, there were two important points. First of all, it proved the existence of the East Continent, a place where the Giant King's Court was. Second, after the \"Sprouting Era,\" the supernatural races had their own kind of civilization. They weren't completely irrational as their descendants believed them to be. Of course, the inclination towards tyranny, cruelty, coldness, and slaughtering still existed, as though they were all in a half-state of losing control. It was only after the \"Dual Era\" that the new generation of elves and giants gained some level of rationality. They had feelings just like Siatas and Groselle.\nThe East Continent seems to be the Forsaken Land of the Gods... It was abandoned during the Cataclysm? Similar thoughts surfaced in Klein's, Leonard's, and Audrey's minds.\nThey were very interested in this, but it was a pity that Siatas had always lived in the Elf King's court. Their occasional forays outside were limited to parades at sea. She had never been to the East Continent, and she lacked the required knowledge.\nUnder Audrey's influence, Siatas's dream began to show the traditions and language of the elves.\nAccording to the legends that the Queen's attendant had heard of, Elvish was created by the king in the \"Sprouting Era.\" Every word was produced with the birth of a first-generation elf. The number of Elvish words meant the number of first-generation elves.\nHowever, the traditions of the elves weren't too unified. They relied heavily on their surroundings-the elves in the forests and the sea were undoubtedly different in all kinds of customs.\nWhat they shared in common was that they believed in the king, who was an ancient god, and \"His\" queen. They liked to make food with the blood of their prey. Many of them had culinary methods such as roasting. Even sea elves often came up to the reefs for a bonfire party. They were close to nature and were good at using all kinds of spices. They idolized the strong, and they were proud of being quick to act before thinking...\nWith myths and reality mixed together, it's hard to tell what's real and what's fake... Their traditions have destroyed my previous theories... Klein listened with a stoic expression as he quickly analyzed every word Siatas said.\nAfter figuring out the relevant matters, Audrey circled around the keyword of the West Continent and made Siatas's dream change. It reflected some of her subconscious memories.\nThe coral palace appeared before Klein and company again. Siatas followed behind Queen of Calamity Cohinem and walked to a crystal window.\nShe glanced at the Queen's exquisite and complicated dress, and she stole a glance at the \"deity\" who controlled calamities. She asked curiously, \"Your Highness, are you looking west?\"\nTo the elves, as long as they didn't feel the pressure of violence, they would ask questions on the spot.\n\"Why do you think so?\" Cohinem didn't turn back as \"She\" asked with an indifferent expression.\n\"I just learned of a legend that our elves originated from the Western Continent,\" Siatas replied. \"Your Highness, does the Western Continent really exist? Is that really where the first-generation elves were born?\"\nCohinem's lips curled slightly as she said with a slightly ethereal voice, \"The Western Continent may exist, but it may not exist either. Every race needs to give themselves an illustrious origin, a home for the mind.\n\"Siatas, where is your home to you?\"\n\"My home?\" Siatas repeated the question as she replied blankly, \"It's where His Majesty and Your Highness are. It's this palace that can lead to the forest where my parents live...\"\nAs she said this, Siatas's emotions gradually turned heavy, lost, and melancholic.\nIt was obvious that she was influenced by her subconscious's corresponding memories.\nShe had entered Groselle's Travels and had been away from home for two to three thousand years.\n\"Therefore, to elves like you, the Western Continent doesn't exist, but to some elves, it definitely exists.\" Queen of Calamity Cohinem calmly gave her final answer.\nSiatas didn't ask further, because she suddenly remembered that the Queen wasn't a first-generation elf.\nSuch a response made Klein increasingly confused and puzzled. Thankfully, from the Second Epoch to the Fifth Epoch, the Western Continent had zero presence, so it didn't have any important secrets related to him. He was just trying to find out more about it and hadn't held out much hope.\nAfter ending the guiding of Siatas's subconscious and since it was almost noon, without any other nearby dreams that they could leap into, Audrey left with Klein and Leonard, and they appeared in Mobet and Siatas's bedroom.\nLooking at the Fourth Epoch viscount whose body had been tightly bound by the elf, Audrey's expression suddenly turned gentle as she said with a laugh, \"They seem to be doing pretty well...\"\n\"No, no, no, it's terrifying to have such a violent, direct, and imaginative wife who dares to take action! Only a person like Mobet would like and enjoy being with her...\" Leonard, who didn't have a poet's talent but had the liberal inclinations of a poet, shook his head as he kept his hands in his pockets.\nAt this point, he muttered in thought, On the contrary, it's true that an experienced thief needs a woman like Siatas to rein him in. Hmm... I wonder what kind of members of the opposite sex Old Man's other family members like...\n\"Sigh, they don't need our envy or objections. This is how they live together. Emperor Roselle once wrote a poem, saying \u2018for my love I'll sacrifice my life[l]'...\"\nAs Klein listened to their discussion, he opened his mouth and closed it again. He didn't tell them that Siatas and Mobet had actually died. It was only when they died that they truly felt their love for one another. The ones living in the book were just copies created by the book world.\nAfter leaving the couple's house, the trio headed to Groselle's blacksmith shop.\nAlong the way, when they went past a street, Klein saw Frunziar, who was known as a philosopher, and Audrey recognized him to be Loenese a glance.\n\"Is that the soldier from a hundred years ago?\" Audrey slowed down her pace and asked.\nKlein recalled Frunziar's longing for his hometown, and the ashes he had placed in Backlund's cemetery. He fell silent for two seconds before nodding gently.\n\"Yes.\"\nMr. World is feeling a little emotional... He's like a calm river on the surface, with a lot of undercurrents and eddies underneath... Audrey nodded indiscernibly and asked, \"Can we enter his dream? I want to get the Judge and Disciplinary Paladin's potion formula.\"\n\"No problem,\" Klein replied as he glanced at Leonard.\nLeonard continued having his hands in his pockets, but his eyes instantly darkened.\nSitting on the bench, Frunziar fell asleep.\nRight on the heels of that, three people appeared in his dream.\nThis was a bustling city with buildings made from wood. The pedestrians who came and went were mostly Loenese.\nThe black-haired, blue-eyed Frunziar stood outside a house as he looked in without daring to approach. Only when a woman wearing an old long dress came out from inside did he excitedly go forward and attempt to hug her.\nHis hug went through the woman without them making contact at all.\nFrunziar stood rooted to the ground as he blankly shouted, \"Mother...\"\nAudrey, who wanted to guide the dream, quietly watched this scene. Then, she looked around and discovered the iconic clock.\n\"Backlund...\" Audrey pursed her lips and turned her head. She looked at Klein and asked, \"Can't they leave the book world?\"\n\"It's been too long. If they leave, they will grow old, die, or even be reduced to dust.\" Klein's voice was like a serene river. \"I delivered one of Frunziar's items to Backlund.\"\nThis... As a Spectator, Audrey acutely sensed the cruel reality behind those words. She couldn't help but raise her head and look out of the dream, looking at the location where Mobet and Siatas were.\nLeonard wanted to ask what it was, but after looking around, he maintained his silence.\nFollowing that, Audrey seriously guided his dream. Outside of obtaining two potion formulas, she made Frunziar return home and live happily with his parents, brothers, and sisters.\nIt was a beautiful dream.\nAfter leaving Frunziar, Klein, Leonard, and Audrey quickly saw Groselle's home.\nThis was the last stop of their exploration. After obtaining information from Groselle's subconscious, they would enter the book world's sea of collective subconscious and seek out the secrets that might exist in this book.\n[1] Adapted from a Hungarian poet, Sandor Petofi's Liberty and Love.","19":"I can only maintain it for about a minute or so... That's way too short, isn't it? A thought flashed through Klein's mind. Without thinking about anything else, he took two steps to the desk.\nHe put down Groselle's Travels and quickly wrote on a piece of paper with 0-08:\n\"George III plans to use this speech to bait out all his enemies who want to sabotage his ritual. However, if everything goes smoothly and nothing happens, he'll take the opportunity to consume the potion and reveal his trump card to aim for divinity. After all, there are too many unknowns in the future, making it unsafe. Furthermore, he has made appropriate preparations for the ritual, they're already prepared to an adequate level.\n\"This is a very reasonable development.\"\nAfter Klein wrote the last sentence, and before he could check if there was anything wrong with the written content, the dim quill in his hand disappeared without a trace, as though it had never existed.\nAnd those few words seemed to drain all of his energy, making him feel dizzy. He took a few steps back and collapsed into his chair.\nIt doesn't make sense... It wasn't exhausting for Ince Zangwill back then... Uh, it should be because I forcefully summoned it, and I didn't dare let 0-08 weave a story on its own. When I wrote on the piece of paper, I had to rely on my own spirituality to support it. As for Ince Zangwill, he could get 0-08's cooperation, so it wasn't that draining... Klein closed his eyes and used Cogitation for a while before feeling better.\nUnder normal circumstances, having had no physical contact with 0-08 and merely meeting it once had made it impossible for him to summon this Grade 0 Sealed Artifact. However, on the one hand, he had the Snake of Fate to personally augment his luck, and on the other hand, he had Groselle's Travels. This was the item left behind by the Dragon of Imagination Ankewelt. Inside it was the City of Miracles, Liveseyd. It had a connection to a certain degree to an existence like 0-08. If it wasn't for some high-level existence's disruption, these two items would've long been reunited.\nKlein didn't know if this fate and particular connection could increase the chances of a successful summoning. He only wanted to give it a try since he didn't stand to lose anything. To his surprise, he really succeeded.\nAnd it was precisely because of this that he didn't dare to use Groselle's Travels to bear the contents of 0-08's projection. He didn't even dare to let them come close, afraid that something irreversible would happen.\nThis was Backlund, which had an extremely dense population!\nYes, logically speaking, there shouldn't be any accidents. After all, 0-08 is a Historical Void projection. It's fake. Groselle's Travels was conjured by the Dragon of Imagination, and it's also fake. A fake combination can't be real in any way. They lack the foundation of a Beyonder characteristic... I can go back to the uninhabited reef island to test it... Klein rubbed his temples and returned to the desk. There, he began reading what he had just written.\nHe didn't directly write that George III would be unsuccessful in his advancement and die on the spot. He believed that if he interfered with a Sequence 1 angel, the projection of 0-08 wouldn't be able to be so direct. He had to be more tactful.\nFurthermore, there was also the Psychology Alchemists and Amon's brother. Overly obvious effects would definitely be detected and easily made use of. All he could do was beat about the bush to mitigate the unknown.\nI hope it works... After staring at it for a while, he folded the piece of paper and stuffed it into his pocket.\nThen, he sacrificed Groselle's Travels back above the gray fog.\nAfter doing all of this, Klein began to consider another problem. It was when he would head out to buy some ice-cream for Will Auceptin.\nBacklund has Zaratul, and it's very possible that Amon is there. If I head out too frequently, we might run into each other. It's a little dangerous... Why don't I summon some ice-cream for Will from the Historical Void? It's very real when eating it, and it'll disappear in fifteen minutes. There's no need to worry about gaining weight at all. It's just splendid... Klein couldn't help but mumble inwardly.\nIn the end, he decided to change his clothes and leave the house because he had to keep his promise!\n...\nSaturday morning, the sky was gray and misty. It made one feel inexplicably stifled.\nThis was a common scene in Backlund's deep winter. Although the smog wasn't as thick and pungent like last year, the geographical environment and climate characteristics had determined that such situations would definitely exist for a long period of time. Furthermore, victory over environmental pollution was never something that could be declared in a year or two.\nAfter putting on a black coat that covered her knees, and a black veil hat, Melissa quickly walked to the door.\nBenson held his hat and shook his head.\n\"A young girl who isn't even twenty years old should be dressed like a teenager. You look overly mature and old-fashioned in that, understand? Old-fashioned.\"\nMelissa glanced at her brother and simply replied, \"The price of a pound of bread has risen by a quarter-pence.\"\n\"This price...\" Benson tsked.\nHe then took out a silver pocket watch covered in vine-leaf patterns and snapped it open.\n\"Let's go. There's still a long way to go to the municipal square.\"\nMelissa tersely responded and went out into the streets with her brother.\n\"Good morning, Mrs. Daniel.\" After taking a few steps forward, Benson saw a neighbor leaving. He greeted her with a smile.\nHe was good at chatting and had long established a good relationship with his neighbors.\nThe lady named Mrs. Daniel wore a pure black dress. She was in her forties and had a thin face. Her face was covered in a thin black veil that hung down from her hat. When she heard the greeting, she nodded and replied simply, \"Good morning, the two of you.\"\nShe didn't make any small talk, and she coldly walked away.\nAs he watched her back, Benson deliberately slowed down his pace. When they finally opened up a distance, he turned to ask his sister, \"What happened to Mrs. Daniel?\n\"I've been too busy recently, so I haven't visited the neighbors in a long time.\"\nMelissa pursed her lips and said, \"Mrs. Daniel's eldest son was confirmed to have died on the front line at the Amantha mountain range. News from yesterday.\"\n\"That tall, bashful, but thoughtful, kind, and sincere young lad? When he came back the last time, he said that he was promoted in the army and became an officer...\" Benson asked in surprise.\nMelissa nodded.\n\"I couldn't imagine that Larry would die just like that...\"\nJust like how she couldn't imagine the tragic deaths of her classmates at school.\nIn just a few seconds, some people could no longer speak, communicate, or study.\nBenson was silent for a moment before sighing.\n\"I've been busy lately. Actually, I've been dealing with bereavement payments, but perhaps the list I received didn't include Larry, so I'm not sure.\n\"There's a lot of information on that list. Some are cheerful, others are humorous, others are the only child within a family. Some are determined, while others are the leaders of the soldiers around them. Some just got married and don't have children. Some are preparing presents for their youngest daughter, while others had love letters with them. They planned on sending it at the post office after the battle... But, they're all dead.\"\nMelissa and Benson fell silent at the same time, and neither of them spoke for a long time.\nWhen they were almost at the intersection, Melissa looked at the road ahead and said in a low voice, \"What do you think His Majesty will be talking about in his speech today?\"\n\"Perhaps it's a form of musters, or perhaps it's to convey the faith that we will prevail,\" Benson said in passing.\nMelissa turned to look at her brother.\n\"This isn't like you, Benson. Shouldn't you be making some snarky remarks?\"\n\"It should wait till the speech is heard and the specific content is understood. The most basic principle of being a person is to not make comment on things that one doesn't know enough of. Otherwise, they would be worse than a curly-haired baboon,\" Benson said with a smile.\nAt this moment, he saw another neighbor.\nThe other party's hair was white, and his face was half-covered with a scarf. He was wearing a thick jacket and was holding a cloth bag in his hand as he hurried past the siblings.\n\"Mr. Thomas's dressing is so strange... Does he still need to do something else?\" Benson looked at the back of the man and asked in puzzlement.\nMelissa replied in a low voice, \"Mrs. Thomas is sick, and that spent quite a bit of their family's savings. Recently, with food prices sharply increasing while Mr. Thomas's income remains the same, he has to queue up at the soup kitchen every few days to get some bread. He's a decent gentleman, so he probably doesn't want others to recognize him.\n\"Also, the food at the soup kitchen is always limited. If one's late, there might not be any left. They'll have to go to the cathedral, the workhouse, and other places. The handouts just happen to start after His Majesty's speech, so Mr. Thomas probably wants to go there directly.\"\nBenson nodded slowly and asked in concern, \"What's wrong with Mrs. Thomas? I know a few good doctors.\"\n\"A disease caused by anxiety,\" Melissa explained what she had heard. \"Mrs. Thomas is very worried about her youngest child who's serving in the army.\"\n\"You mean Thomas Jr.?\" Benson frowned slightly.\nAfter receiving his sister's confirmation, he fell silent, as if recalling something.\nAfter a while, when they approached the nearest municipal square, Benson looked ahead and whispered, \"Thomas Jr. is already dead...\"\n\"...\" Melissa didn't respond, but her expression was a little dazed.\nThey walked forward silently, as if they were relying on inertia.\nMore and more people appeared in front of them. These people were either dressed in formal attire or holding canes, dressed up as gentlemen. Otherwise, they were dressed in blue, green, yellow, and red-colored skirts; sweaters and leather jackets matched with pants; or dark-colored petticoats. Their colors were dull.\nThey came out of their houses and from the streets they were on, like water droplets splashing upward. They merged together at the intersection, forming a tiny stream.\nThe stream surged ahead, combining with other tributaries, and flowed into the square's entrance, interweaving into a majestic torrent.\nThe torrents slowly surged forward, flooding the square.\nAmidst this torrent of humans, Melissa felt like she was as puny as a water droplet.","20":"The silver-black, three-tiered accessory box with many embedded gems quickly opened, revealing the interior of the second level.\nIt was dark. Even the surrounding barriers seemed to blend in with it. It gave one the feeling that it was a pocket of infinite space.\nIn an instant, the darkness lit up with countless resplendent speckles, as if they had transformed into a miniature cosmos, a miniature universe.\nThese bright points of light rapidly spun as the surrounding scene changed several times in a second.\nWhat Klein expected was to move Abomination Suah, the Rose School of Thought Shaman, and many of their followers to the ruins of the battle of the gods. By making them leave the Southern Continent, they wouldn't be able to immediately sense that Klarman had been attacked. This way, they wouldn't be able to provide any timely and effective assistance. However, the second level of the Box of the Great Old Ones had an element of randomness to it. The act of sending things to the designated scene succeeded a handful of times. Most of the time, the selected destination would suffer an unavoidable change. This was something that couldn't be influenced with luck, and at the very least, no one below Sequence 0 could do so.\nTherefore, when he opened the second level of the Box of the Great Old Ones, Klein didn't know what would happen. It was the same as not using any Beyonder powers to cheat at gambling. He had to rely solely on observation to push out all his chips. This left his heart filled with anxiety. Of course, he wasn't too worried. No matter where the Box of the Great Old Ones brought him and Miss Messenger, it was impossible to harm him in any way. After all, Reinette Tinekerr was fake, the Box of the Great Old Ones was fake, and even he himself was fake.\nWith this in consideration, even if he was thrown underground by the Box of the Great Old Ones and faced a terrifying corruption, Klein could instantly dispel the Historical Void projection, enter Sefirah Castle to do a complete \"disinfection\" and sever all connections.\nBuilding on this foundation, he had the ability to help Miss Messenger's main body resist the corruption. Since it wasn't directly experienced-through the layer of a historical projection-the outcome was relatively better.\nThe only thing he needed to worry about was that the random scene selected by the Box of the Great Old Ones was where Miss Sharron and Emlyn were attacking Shaman King Klarman. That way, it would be equivalent to leading the main enemy force to head straight for his headquarters. This meant that they could only consider giving up on the operation, and he and Reinette Tinekerr would undertake the responsibility of helping all participants escape from the battlefield and escape the Southern Continent.\nThe probability of this happening was very low, but he had to be wary.\nAt that moment, due to the influence of Abomination Suah's aura, Klein's spirituality had \"frozen\" quite a bit. It seemed to bind his body and soul, but it still flowed into the Box of the Great Old Ones, maintaining its open state.\nIn the blink of an eye, the scene in the second level of the Box of the Great Old Ones changed, revealing a tiny, vast sea.\nKlein, Reinette Tinekerr, Abomination Suah, the hooded Shaman King, and many Rose School of Thought believers and subordinates saw endless yellow sand and the extreme cold of the night.\nOther than the projection of the Chained God, all the living beings on the battlefield were instantly transported to a desert!\nAs for the projection, due to the departure of Abomination Suah, the connection was severed, preventing \"His\" powers from seeping into reality.\nWithout the luxury of time to examine where he was currently, Klein dispelled the Box of the Great Old Ones and snapped his fingers, summoning a scarlet flame as he constantly jumped within them.\nHe had done so to avoid the attention of Abomination Suah, as well as grab the opportunity to complete the summoning of the Historical Void projection.\nAt that moment, he heard an extremely evil roar. His mind suddenly went blank, and he temporarily lost all his thoughts.\nThe scarlet flames he was immersed in came alive as well and, like a cage, bound him to the ground.\nWith just a roar and the influence of some auras, Abomination Suah had already restrained him to a certain extent.\nIf it wasn't for the fact that Reinette Tinekerr, who was in \"Her\" peak condition, was his teammate, Klein's projection would've been helplessly executed. Perhaps his actual body would suffer certain effects.\nAt this moment, the huge doll the size of a castle took a step forward and opened its tightly shut mouth.\nThere was no sound, but the distorted \"wood\" that was covered in pitch-black liquid seemed to encounter a flood dike. It repelled backward and raised the arms with strange protruding objects.\nThis was a curse that Reinette Tinekerr had been silently accumulating for a very, very long time. The root of the curse was the anger, hatred, and \"Her\" grudge that had emerged after \"She\" suffered an attack!\nHowever, Abomination Suah didn't show any obvious changes. \"He\" only staggered a little and froze for a second before returning to normal.\nHigh-level existences were always able to restrain low-level Beyonders of the same pathway. They could even exert a certain influence over space!\nAnd using this opportunity to escape the restraints of the flames, Klein used Creeping Hunger to flash to another side, avoiding the Blood Moon Arrow created by the Rose School of Thought's Shaman King.\nHe didn't dare to look directly at Abomination Suah. He seized the opportunity and reached out with his right hand to pull out from the void ahead.\nThis time, he didn't drag anything out.\nKlein continued Blinking about and repeated his actions. Then, he successfully dragged out a figure. It was none other than the leader of the Church of Evernight's ascetics, the angel of the Concealment domain, Arianna, who wore a simple linen robe and a tree bark belt!\nMy report from before worked after all... A thought flashed through his mind as he activated Creeping Hunger once again and teleported elsewhere.\nThe eyes of Arianna's projection darted slightly as her eyes instantly turned dark and deep. Following that, she joined in the battle between Reinette Tinekerr and Abomination Suah.\nWith \"Her\" help, Reinette Tinekerr, who was in a rather difficult situation and trying hard to create opportunities for him, finally managed to catch \"Her\" breath. \"She\" didn't get possessed by Abomination Suah, nor did \"She\" become a real doll.\nThe Rose School of Thought's Shaman King showcased his well-rounded aspect towards the Darkness and Moon domains. He attempted to use spells like \"Abyss Shackles\" to restrict Klein's movement, but the short-distance \"Blinking\" was simply too effective. Without the projection of the Chained God and \"His\" influence of the surrounding area, and the interference of Abomination, Klein was like a fish in water. He was free and relaxed. He only needed to consider how to deal with his enemy's spells every two \"Teleports.\"\nHowever, the Shaman King could hardly stop him in an effective manner due to the unpredictability of where he would appear next.\nDuring this process, Klein grabbed at the void a few more times until he dragged out a figure.\nThis figure had bronze skin, black hair, and brown eyes. His facial features were soft and his gaze was cold. He wore a deep black robe embroidered with golden thread. He wore a golden crown and was none other than the former Death Consul, Azik Eggers!\nAnother angel... The Shaman King's eyelids twitched as he watched. At this moment, Abomination Suah suddenly inserted multiple black arms into the desert.\nThe desert nearby boiled and was blanketed with a thick black liquid. This extended into the distance and invaded the void, disrupting the overlapping of reality and the spirit world.\nTaking advantage of the fact that his teleportation wasn't completely affected, Klein \"Blinked\" behind Mr. Azik. With \"Him\" shielding him, he quickly grabbed at the air a few times.\nHis arm suddenly sank and he pulled out a silvery-white snake's tail.\nAnother angel!\nThe reason why he dared to directly summon the three angels was because this Historical Void projection of his was summoned by Reinette Tinekerr using the Staff of the Stars. The spirituality consumed was borne by this Ancient Bane, not Fors.\nOtherwise, Fors would've already fainted the moment the Servant of Concealment, Arianna, descended. There was no way she could endure spirituality expenditure such as this.\nFors's purpose was to first summon Gehrman Sparrow's historical projection so that he had plenty of time to set up the ritual and bring the Staff of the Stars to the real world. Then, the maintenance of the historical projection would be dispelled, allowing him to return to the fog and have Reinette Tinekerr summoned another him.\nIn less than ten seconds, as Abomination Suah had focused his attention on Reinette Tinekerr and subconsciously belittled Klein, leading \"Him\" to not only losing the help of the Chained God's projection, but also being thrown from the state of being the one who had laid in ambush to the one being besieged by four powerful angels.\nWithout any hesitation, this Sequence 1 angel opened \"His\" mouth and chanted in ancient Hermes words. \"He\" had once again prayed to the Chained God.\n...\nWhen the Door of Summoning opened in front of Shaman King Klarman, just the extension of two trembling hands was enough for a thought to abruptly flash across Emlyn White's mind.\nThe other angel of the Rose School of Thought, the King of Curses, Barranca!\nThis was information provided by Sharron and Maric.\nUpon seeing this, Emlyn's mind tensed up. Without any hesitation, he waved his arm and threw the Vision of White at the Door of Summoning!\nThis was partly because he was experiencing a battle at the demigod level for the first time, so he couldn't help but overreact. On the other hand, he wasn't worried about losing the Vision of White. After all, it belonged to the Sanguine. At worst, he would repay it in the future over time.\nAt the same time, even without the Sealed Artifact, he still had other mystical items to use, such as Leymano's Travels.\nWith the notebook, Emlyn could summon the Unshadowed Crucifix to replace the Vision of White.\nAfter the eyeball-shaped glass sphere flew out, it continuously absorbed the light along the way, bringing with it extreme darkness.\nWhen it got close to the Door of Summoning, the Vision of White suddenly exploded into an extremely brilliant glow. Like a blazing sun at noon, it enveloped both the hands and the door, melting away all evil, degenerate, darkness, filth, and undead auras.\nThe full blood moon on Klarman's forehead was clearly affected. All the light beams were compressed to his side, preventing him from affecting his surroundings.\nSeizing this opportunity, Sharron's figure that appeared in midair distorted, turning into a human-sized puppet.\nThis puppet was identical to Shaman King Klarman. It had messy, black-and-white hair and a pair of bright red eyes.\nAs for Emlyn, he raised his left arm and revealed a translucent ring that was worn outside his gloved index finger.\nThe ring seemed to be made of light-red amber, and there was a blood-colored gem embedded on it.\nLilith's Ring!\nThis was a ring personally made by the Sanguine Ancestor, the ancient goddess, Lilith.\nIt could project a door that led deep into the spirit world for a certain amount of time, summoning an unknown creature.\nEmlyn wasn't sure what he would obtain. He only knew that, under normal circumstances, the summoned object was usually slightly stronger than him, but the possibility of directly pulling out a demigod wasn't impossible.\nAt the tip of the ring, the blood-colored gem emitted a faint glow as an illusory door covered in mysterious patterns appeared in front of Emlyn.\nThe door creaked open, the gap in the door widening.\nShaman King Klarman had just recovered his senses from the Sun's illumination when he saw a moon rise up behind the Door of Summoning.\nIt was a bright moon, one that was slightly silver in color.","21":"Illusory black threads emanated out of Senor's body and entered Klein's hands. With every jolt in spirituality, it gave a different reaction.\nIn fact, there was no need to use both hands when controlling the Spirit Body Threads. Klein was just accustomed to doing so, as it gave him a feeling like he was truly controlling a puppet.\nFrom the looks of it, other Marionettists can discover each other's marionettes. The Senor's abnormality can't be hidden from their eyes, so I have to be careful about this.Klein concluded the problems he discovered, and he quickly turned his thoughts back onto Senor.\nThis Admiral of Blood was dead. His Spirit Body had become a vessel for the marionette, losing any traits that belonged to him. Therefore, many divination methods were ineffective against him.\nOf course, methods to seek his corpse were still effective. Klein planned on \"cleansing\" the Wraith in the gray fog before using Paper Angels to envelop the mirror-like objects that he had possessed before placing him into a cigar case that was sealed by a wall of spirituality, along with Azik's copper whistle. This created a 3-layered interference effect.\nThis way, Klein believed that, even if the Rose School of Thought angel wished to, it was impossible to use divination to lock onto his position via Admiral of Blood.\nAs for whether the Mother Tree of Desire had left any \"backdoors\" in Senor's body, he wasn't too worried. This was because if that really happened, \"She\" could've mutated Senor during the demigod battle royale in order to deal with him. Based on the situation back then, there was a guaranteed chance of success.\nMother Tree of Desire, or should I say, the Chained God, strictly controls its organization's members. It relies on a vow contract and other methods that are ingrained into the soul. This can be inferred from Miss Sharron's descriptions and my interaction with the corresponding characteristics...\nAs long as I don't attempt to use Admiral of Blood to divine the secrets of the Rose School of Thought or the potion formula of the Mutant pathway, I wouldn't trigger any problems. The Werewolf Beyonder characteristic has remained normal despite being above the gray fog for so long...\nBesides, there's still the gray fog \"cleansing\" process. If there are any latent problems, it should be washed out...Klein thought for a while and took out Azik's copper whistle from inside his body.\nHe turned his right wrist and made the side with fewer patterns appear under the sunlight, making it reflect the light.\nImmediately, the copper whistle had Senor's figure appear on it as it rapidly turned clear.\nThe Admiral of Blood in front of Klein suddenly vanished as a result.\nPerhaps the Mother Tree of Desire can use the vow contract and other methods to vaguely lock on, but that doesn't matter. \"She\" can sense the gray fog's unique trait on me anyway, and \"She\" will sense me once I'm within range... Besides, this marionette might be destroyed at anytime when I use it as a shield...Klein was like a jobless tramp who was debt-laden. He felt that there was almost nothing he was afraid of.\nOf course, he really was debt-ridden.\nAs long as I advance to a demigod and can hide my unique trait, it's fine losing marionettes...Klein surveyed the area as he bent his back to pick up the silver necklace. He took four steps counterclockwise while chanting the incantation softly.\nThis time, he hadn't entered via summoning his Spirit Body, so he couldn't directly return.\nThe grayish-white fog was quickly emanated as hysterical ravings and roars echoed for an eternity. Azik's copper whistle didn't react abnormally, which meant that there weren't any latent problems with Admiral of Blood.\nSitting at the end of the bronze table, Klein placed Azik's copper whistle in front of him, making Senor, who was dressed in a dark red coat and old triangular hat, appear. He was like a butler awaiting orders from his master.\n\"Do you have any other items on you?\" Klein asked, as though Admiral of Blood was still alive.\nThis was his attempt to act as a Marionettist!\nFollowing that, he controlled Senor, made him rummage through every pocket as he subsequently took out 325 pounds, 16 soli, and 8 pence in cash. There were also 13 gold coins.\nApart from that, perhaps due to his frequent act of transforming into a Wraith state, Senor didn't carry anything else on him.\nHow poor... As a pirate admiral, you don't even have a single mystical item? Did you hand it over to the Rose School of Thought or your subordinates?Klein seriously considered cashing out Admiral of Blood via the black market.\nJust in Loen alone, he was worth 42,000 pounds!\nYes, claiming the bounty from Loen isn't pragmatic. Be it the Church of Storms and the kingdom's military, they will follow the clues to capture Gehrman Sparrow, who managed to embroil so many demigods in a battle royale, and then investigate the organization backing him. They wouldn't even pay, and they might even plant a trap...\nBy the same logic, the Churches and governments of other countries must have similar ideas. However, they might be easier to work with. Retrieving the bounty will require substantial risks...\nBesides, there's no rush. I'll send Senor out when I plan on switching marionettes. After all, being a marionette for a few days won't change his identity or value...Klein reined in his thoughts and cast his gaze on the silver necklace with an ancient coin attached to it.\nHe immediately used divination to gain the gist of its origins and usage.\nIt came from a Sequence 5 Winner from the Life School of Thought. After dying at the hands of a Rose School of Thought demigod, this gentleman's Beyonder characteristic and psyche fused with an ordinary silver necklace that he carried with him, turning into a mystical item.\nAs for the reason why the ordinary silver necklace would be carried by a Sequence 5 powerhouse for extended periods of time, Klein was unable to receive any effective revelations from it, as it had been too long and it had been corrupted.\nThe mystical item had two uses. One was to passively make the wearer lucky. In their daily lifestyle, the owner would encounter good things, easily succeeding in whatever they did. When suffering a lethal blow or terrifying disaster, ridiculous scenes would happen, allowing them to be successfully rescued. The latter situation only lasted for ten minutes.\nThe second use was to actively give an enemy bad luck, making the target unlucky. Be it in daily life or combat, it was easy for them to experience failure due to some trivial problem.\nThe corresponding negative effects of the necklace was the Conservation of Luck. After being lucky, they would immediately meet with repeated bad luck. They would be as unlucky as they were lucky before. It needed the wearer to be devoted and seriously avoid any danger; otherwise, it was very easy for them to die in a comedic manner, and even harm people around them.\nThe luck received in one's daily life would often revert back after a month. The user would end up unlucky regardless of whether they wore it or not. However, such bad luck was slowly released, so it wasn't too dangerous.\nAnd luck obtained in combat would similarly strike back ten minutes later in a similar vigor.\nOverall, this is a rather good mystical item, but I don't have much use for it. After all, Fate Councilor Ricciardo was unable to change my luck... Hmm, I'll just wear it on me for now. It has few negative effects on me. I'll sell it if there's a chance to pay off my debt with Miss Messenger... Miss Messenger wants gold coins, while I have gold pounds. It's nearly impossible to exchange 10,000 gold coins through the banks or official markets. From the looks of it, I'll have to do it in batches, getting each Tarot Club member to change some of it...Klein soon decided on a plan as he casually came up with a name for the necklace:\nScales of Luck!\nFollowing that, he cast his gaze onto Senor, who was standing reverently to his side. He began to study the powers a Wraith had.\nForceful possession, Enemy Control, Wraith's Shriek, Mirror Blink, Obstacle Penetration, death-related spells, and Invisibility that wouldn't be discovered by most Mid- and Low-Sequence Beyonders...Klein distinguished each power, and he matched them with Sharron's and Maric's description, as well as his experience gained from combat.\nHe soon concluded this, afraid that the candle in the outside world would finish burning. And a dark cave was extremely bad for the present him who had a phobia of the dark.\nKlein immediately took out a paper figurine from the junk pile, and together with the Black Emperor card, he stirred some of the powers above the gray fog, turning it into an anti-divination \"angel.\"\nThis angel rapidly spread its wings and wrapped around a gold coin. On its reflective side was Senor's figure.\nThen, Klein brought the gold coin, Azik's copper whistle, Death Knell, and his suitcase back to the real world. As for Creeping Hunger and Groselle's Travels, one of them hadn't been fed, and the other might cause Klein to be swallowed into the book for carrying it for too long. Therefore, they were left in the junk pile above the gray fog.\nHaving returned to the cave, Klein hurriedly placed the gold coin and Azik's copper whistle into a cigar case before sealing it with a wall of spirituality.\nHe cleaned up the scene, switched into formal clothes, and carried his suitcase. He followed the beach until he came to a residential area. He discovered that he was near Pritz Harbor.\nHe didn't immediately return to Backlund. Instead, he changed his appearance, took a steam locomotive, and headed for Conant City in Desi Bay. He planned on circling the area once before changing his identity again.\n...\nBansy Harbor.\nAlger Wilson looked at the destroyed city under the afternoon sun.\nHe saw that the buildings had completely collapsed, and there were deep chasms in the ground and charred spots everywhere.\nSuch a scene extended into the depths of the island. Even the mountain had collapsed.\nAt that moment, there wasn't anyone from the Church of Storms watching the ruins, since there wasn't anything here. And the plans to rebuild the harbor wasn't brought forward at all.\nAlger jumped off the Blue Avenger and circled the ruins with his sailors, but they didn't discover anything of value.\n\"Let's go,\" he instructed with a staid attitude.\nHe soon boarded the ship which hoisted its sails and left the island.\nAfter an unknown period of time, a figure suddenly walked out from the depths of the ruins.\nHe wore a double-breasted, pure black clerical robe. He had dark golden hair, and his facial features were clear and distinct, like an ancient, classical sculpture.\nHis eyes were dark blue, nearing black. They looked lusterless, but they were filled with dense blood capillaries.","22":"Bernadette was wearing an Intis-styled blouse and was sitting there quietly. Her chestnut-colored hair was naturally draped over her shoulders, and her straight brows were spread out perfectly. She actually had the aura of a female professional from Earth, one that had been in a high position for a long period of time.\nThe Emperor's sense of aesthetics still has quite the influence over Queen Mystic. However, it's limited by the environment around her, and it cannot be fully manifested... Klein took off his hat and pressed it to his chest. He bowed slightly before casually pulling out a chair and sitting down.\nWith a sweep of her blue eyes that resembled the deep-blue sea, Bernadette's gentle and calm voice rang out:\n\"Why did you contact me so urgently this time?\"\nAren't you a Clairvoyant? Didn't you receive a hint of a revelation? Klein subconsciously replied in his mind before he felt that he was being too arrogant.\nThis should be the aftereffects of interacting with the Red Angel evil spirit for too long... With \"His\" level, it would naturally affect the people around \"Him.\" If \"He\" was willing, this effect would definitely turn into a form of corruption... Klein quickly did a self-analysis and made a judgment.\nHe pondered for a moment before asking, \"Have you attained what you wanted to achieve in Backlund?\"\nBernadette slowly shook her head.\n\"No.\nYou can even say that I failed.\"\n\"Oh?\" Klein used a tone to express his surprise and puzzlement.\nBernadette glanced at him and said unhurriedly, \"There's a strange name for the Sequence 2 potion of the Mystery Pryer pathway. It's called \u2018the Sage.' To advance to this level, one has to prevent a disaster that involves a higher level of power.\"\nSage... So that's where \"sage\" of the Hidden Sage comes from... Klein was momentarily enlightened. Just as he was about to ask, he heard Queen Mystic continue, \"I anticipated such an opportunity in Backlund, so I came here a few years in advance to make preparations. I've recently been waiting for it for a long time.\n\"Unfortunately, I predicted that it would happen in the second half of this year. Last year, I wasn't in Backlund at the end of the year, so I wasn't able to stop the Great Smog. And in this war, I tried my best to do something, and I achieved something. But to my surprise, Feysac directly attacked Backlund with an air raid, and the disaster ultimately erupted.\"\nThat's why you said you failed... Klein nodded indiscernibly and said with a sigh, \"I didn't expect the ones to start the war to be the Feysacians either.\"\nAs he spoke, he sighed inwardly. The difficulty of Queen Mystic's advancement ritual was controversial. It all depended on one's luck.\nOne had to know that before he became a demigod, Klein had already stopped the True Creator from descending. He had saved Tingen and Backlund, which were feats that could definitely satisfy the ritual requirements of becoming a Sage. But under normal circumstances, there weren't as many disasters like these, and they weren't things that could easily be stopped.\nJust like the present situation, Amon's brother had planned for one to two thousand years. Even if something went awry with King George III, war would erupt as \"He\" had expected. This was because the root cause of the Uniqueness of the Death pathway hadn't been resolved.\nThis made him suspect that Mr. Azik's life in the Northern Continent had always been under the arrangement of Amon's brother. If not, how did \"He,\" who had lost his memories, escape from the sights of the various major Churches without a shape-shifting mask?\nMore importantly, it was unknown why Azik had used his real name in this life!\nAnd this wasn't something that was suspected by anyone, nor did it incur any investigations!\nIs this all part of your plan? Amon's brother... Upon thinking of this, Klein felt a certain trauma, a result of post- traumatic stress disorder. His body nearly trembled.\nHe silently took a deep breath and looked at Queen Mystic and added, \"This war involves the son of the Creator, King of Angels, and the true deities. It's not something you can stop.\"\nWith Bernadette's knowledge and experience, she still had some changes to her facial expression when she heard the sentence. She repeated a few keywords in a low voice:\n\"The son of the Creator... King of Angels... Deities...\"\nShe wasn't too surprised by this, as if she had already made a prediction. However, even if she was a Clairvoyant, she wasn't able to pry into the \"script\" composed by Amon's brother.\nAfter repeating it again, Bernadette fell silent for two to three seconds before sighing to herself, \"So that's the reason...\" Klein adjusted his posture and thought.\n\"Actually, to you, this war is also an opportunity.\n\"Next, there will be many disasters, including the clashing of powers at the angel level. I believe that you should at least be in control of a Grade 0 Sealed Artifact. You can stop certain matters from happening at the critical moment. Of course, you have to choose a good time and method.\"\nBernadette nodded gently and agreed with what he said. She also tacitly acknowledged that she possessed at least one Grade 0 Sealed Artifact.\nOf course, as the daughter of the protagonist of the previous era, as the child Emperor Roselle doted on the most, it would be unbelievable if her father didn't leave her one or two Grade 0 Sealed Artifacts.\nWhat was more important was that Bernadette was already preparing the ritual needed to advance to Sage. This meant that she definitely had the corresponding Sequence 2 Beyonder characteristic in her hands. To a certain extent, it was equivalent to a Grade 0 Sealed Artifact.\nAfter tacitly agreeing, Queen Mystic Bernadette's gentle but emotionless voice changed slightly.\n\"However, I still don't like war, even though it will give me a chance.\n\"I once hated him and couldn't understand him. That's why I didn't call him father for many years. It's because he did too many things against the trend of the times and hurt the innocent. I couldn't accept my heroic father turning into a crazy tyrant...\n\"And now, through the answers from the entity behind you and my own investigations, I somewhat understand his situation. I understand that he was suffering from despair, pain, and loneliness. I understand him as a drowning person, only struggling on instinct.\"\nWhen Klein heard that, he sighed and felt his emotions in turmoil.\nIn this world, the only people who understood Huang Tao-Roselle Gustav-the most were probably the two people sitting here.\nOf course, this feeling didn't stop him from sensing that Queen Mystic Bernadette's condition was a little different today. In the past few times they had met, this king's daughter had never said so much, nor had she opened her heart so directly. At most, she would play the tune of music, subtly expressing her sadness.\nAfter some thought, Klein pretended not to notice, and he asked, \"When did \u2018He' start changing? Do you think there was any prior warning, or something worth paying attention to?\"\nQueen Mystic Bernadette's deep blue eyes moved slightly, as though she had sunken into her trove of memories.\nAfter a while, she slowly said, \"Not long ago, he proudly said to me, \u2018Haven't you always wanted to know what's surrounding our moon and other planets? In the future, our journey might be towards the sea of stars.\"1\nThe sea of stars... What's on the moon and other planets... As Klein pondered over Queen Mystic's words, he suddenly recalled a key phrase and something.\nThe keyword was:\nCosmos!\nThat matter was:\nMr. Door had once told Emperor Roselle that once he had the ability, he could take a look at the moon. That would resolve many of his doubts.\nThe emperor finally went? That hysterical diary page[l] was written after this exploration attempt? He had unknowingly changed his personality, becoming extreme? Klein recalled the corresponding content. Under Queen Mystic Bernadette's gaze, he deliberated and said, \"At your level, you should more or less know that there's corruption coming from the cosmos.\"\nBernadette nodded and didn't pursue the matter. It was as though she knew that Gehrman Sparrow wasn't sure either. She knew that only an angel-level demigod could detect and resist the corruption.\nAfter more than ten seconds of silence, the topic was directed towards Klein's reason for being here.\n\"One of the reasons for this war is because the Loen King, George III, discovered the nine secret mausoleums left behind by the Blood Emperor, doing so with the intention of switching to the Black Emperor pathway and becoming a Sequence 0. As such, he abolished the Grain Act...\"\nKlein didn't care if Queen Mystic knew anything about these matters. He followed his own pace and roughly told her everything without missing out any key matters. Finally, he said, \"The Black Emperor does have the ability to revive, but once a new Black Emperor appears, the original entity would perish completely.\"\nThe original entity here referred to Emperor Roselle, who might've succeeded before being \"assassinated.\"\nSometimes, Klein even suspected that Roselle had intentionally given others a chance which resulted in him perishing on the spot. This way, when he revived from the astral world and regained his Uniqueness and absorbed the three Sequence 1 characteristics, he would no longer absorb the characteristics of Knowledge Emperor, Arcane Scholar, and the characteristics of another pathway. He could make himself pure; thus, free from madness.\nThis was a way to live through death, but the prerequisite was that Roselle's ritual had succeeded. He had died during or after the ritual, and not before the ritual.\nQueen Mystic Bernadette took it all in before slowly saying, \"You want to stop George III?\"\n\"Yes.\" Klein nodded frankly.\n\"Why?\" Bernadette pressed in an unperturbed tone.\nThe corners of Klein's mouth curled up as he smiled.\n\"Some ridiculous reasons that aren't worth mentioning.\"\nBernadette's gaze landed on his face for a moment before she said, \"That's enough. I'm also doing such things for something that has slim chances, one that's almost impossible to happen.\n\"We can cooperate on stopping George III.\"\nWe're all \"ridiculous\" people... Klein sighed and said, \"I'll give you the method to summon my messenger.\" \"Alright.\" Bernadette reached out her right hand and lightly tapped the table.\nThe fountain pen that was originally placed diagonally in front of her suddenly jumped up, as if it was held by an invisible elf before writing fluidly on the paper.\n\"This is the method needed for summoning my messenger,\" said Bernadette calmly.\n[1] Author's Note: From Chapter 715","23":"The actions of the messenger shocked Klein for a full five seconds before he recovered. He bent over and picked up the letter.\n\"Even if Mr. Azik is unable to use a good portion of his abilities as a Beyonder, because of his memory loss, being able to send out such a messenger should make him powerful enough to deal with a Sequence 7 or 6 Beyonder.\"His heart reflected his shocked and envious expression. He didn't unfold the letter immediately. Instead, he placed the letter into his pocket, together with the Slumber Charms.\nThe carriage continued forward. When Klein exited the carriage at Daffodil Street, he instinctively looked at the driver, Cesare, only to see his relaxed smile, as if he hadn't noticed anything unusual that had happened.\nKlein nodded and returned home after observing Cesare with his Spirit Vision.\nHe looked at the balcony and pipes on the second floor and pondered for a few seconds. He decided to maintain his gentlemanly behavior and not attempt to scale the pipe back into his room. As for his stained clothes, he would take them to the Blackthorn Security Company tomorrow and get a professional to wash them through the police department. That would prevent his clothes from shocking his maid Bella and his sister Melissa.\nKlein had removed the reverse lock on the front door before he leaped out the window from the second floor. Now, he took advantage of the fact that it was late at night and quietly opened the door to his house, deftly making his way in.\nAfter closing and locking the main door, he heaved a sigh of relief. He went up to the second floor with hushed footsteps.\nStopping before his locked bedroom, Klein took out a tarot card calmly. He inserted it into the slit of the door and lightly pulled, easily breaking the specialized lock he designed himself.\nHe then entered the room, locked the door, and removed his clothes, before he fully relaxed.\nIt sure feels like being a thief...Klein laughed as he shook his head. He calmly took out his revolver and placed it under the pillow.\nAfter he was finished with all of that, he lit up the gas lamp and sat in front of his desk. He took out the letter and began reading seriously.\n\"I'm sorry for replying only now. I've been busy searching for traces of my past. I've also been meeting up with former teachers and students and those drag on late into the night.\n\"I finally understand the encounters that I've had over the past two days after reading your letter. The police searched every room in the hotel that I'm staying at. There was a person who secretly snooped around in the hotel at night. Yes, I'm talking about a person with Beyonder powers.\n\"... So Rear Admiral Hurricane Qilangos, who's a frequent character in novels and newspapers, has infiltrated Backlund and has gone on quite a killing spree. I remember that he's not only wanted by the Loen Kingdom, he's also on the bounty list of the Feysac Empire, the Intis Republic, the Feynapotter Kingdom...\"\nSo, how much is the bounty?Klein subconsciously wondered.\nHe didn't get an answer because Azik had switched to mentioning something else.\n\"I find the abilities of a Shepherd that you described quite familiar, it's as if I've seen it somewhere, but I cannot remember where. It must be an encounter from one of my past lives. Not being able to recall it makes me very frustrated.\"\nEh, Mr. Azik is a little interested in the Shepherd. I can use this to get him to help me. Yes, this sure is coincidental... No, this is not a coincidence, but inevitable!\nIt can be inferred that Mr. Azik has lived for over a thousand years and is most likely a High-Sequence Beyonder. Then, he would most likely have encountered the powers of many different Beyonders in his earlier lives. He would also have deeper impressions of those that were more unique... In other words, it isn't only the Shepherd that would give him feelings of familiarity, but jobs such as the Unshadowed, Demon Hunter, or Guardian that would do so as well...\nIt's highly likely that Mr. Azik would find any mystical item that corresponds to a particular Sequence's abilities familiar and have his interest piqued. That's something that can be imagined...\nKlein was doubtful at first before being enlightened. He was a lot more certain as a result.\nHe shifted his gaze and continued to read the letter.\n\"I've long recalled some parts of the sacrificial ritual you asked about, probably because I have a deeper impression of them. Perhaps I was a priest in my one of my more recent lifetimes.\n\"I have to remind you and warn you, that you have to be very cautious when using sacrificial rituals. You cannot entrust your safety to evil gods or hidden, mysterious existences. They do not have consciences like we do.\n\"Also, you have to possess a strong sense of right and wrong, for the evil gods and devils often create seemingly harmless identities for themselves. My opinion is that you cannot sacrifice something whose presence you are not fully aware of; otherwise, your soul could end up being the sacrificial item.\"\nIn simple terms, evil gods and devils will take on another form, disguising themselves as someone trustworthy... Just like on the Internet, an account that claims to be a seemingly adorable chick might be controlled by a huge bloke... He had to be cautious even if they were to meet offline after confirming the person's looks, as the person might just be cross-dresser...Klein didn't disregard Azik's warning just because he was conducting the sacrificial ritual for himself. He nodded in approval.\nAfter Azik emphasized a few things he had to look out for, he quickly explained the sacrificial ritual he knew of.\n\"First, set up the ritual. Choose the symbols based on which deity or unorthodox mysterious existence you are going to offer a sacrifice to. Use the corresponding herbs and minerals of \u2018His' or \u2018Her' domain. Of course, you can also make them into holy oils, ointments, scents, and other items in advance.\"\nSymbols?Klein froze for a moment. He realized that he-The Fool that didn't belong to this era-didn't know what his corresponding symbol was...\nHe thought for a moment, quickly recalling the complex symbol on the back of his chair at the ancient bronze table. It was made up of a Pupil-less Eye which represented secrecy, and the partial contorted lines which represented change.\nThat should be my symbol, or more accurately, that is what symbolizes me in the world above the gray fog. My domain is much simpler then-secrecy, change, good luck... But I cannot be too sure of that, so I'll have to try it out... Even if the symbol is wrong, as long as I get my honorary name right, the target of the sacrifice wouldn't point towards some other entity. The worst thing that could happen is that the ritual would fail. Of that, I'm certain...Klein thought as he rubbed the surface of the paper as he formulated a plan in his heart.\nHis eyes focused on the letter once again, reading the rest of the letter.\n\"Second, you need to be clear if the sacrifice needs to happen at a specific time. Then, follow the processes of a normal ritual, until you finish reciting the honorable names and incantations of the ritual.\n\"You must remember to use either Jotun, Dragonese, Elvish, or ancient Hermes. You must use the natural powers in these languages to establish a direct connection with the corresponding entity. You can design the exact incantations to use, but it must include these critical terms: \u2018pray,' \u2018notice,' \u2018offer,' \u2018kingdom,' \u2018gates,' and \u2018open.'\n\"Finally, you must use materials that have a certain spirituality quality to create a connection with the natural powers of the incantation. This will allow you to construct a tunnel that connects to the gates of the kingdom where the corresponding entity resides. If the entity is interested, then your sacrifice is complete.\n\"This step isn't absolutely necessary. If you can make the corresponding entity very interested in your sacrifice, then \u2018He' will open the gates to \u2018His' kingdom for you after you finish reciting the incantations, establishing a stable tunnel on \u2018His' own accord. Of course, this would often imply danger as the orthodox result as relatively friendly hidden gods rarely do this. Only evil gods or devils would reply to you directly in order to achieve their goals.\"\nMaterials that have spirituality are not cheap... I wonder if merely reciting the incantations would allow me to open a sacrificial tunnel similar to the Door of Summoning? I wonder if I could make use of the abilities of the world above the gray fog... Yes, I'll try that first and only get the materials with spirituality from the underground market if I fail. Do I need Beyonder ingredients? It should be fine if it possesses a certain amount of spirituality, right?Klein thought about the 300 pounds lying around in his anonymous account. He also thought about the 10 plus pounds of savings that he had saved up.\nBeyonder materials were not completely identical to materials that possessed spirituality. For example, the heart that Hood Eugen left behind was a Beyonder ingredient while the black scales were a material possessing certain amounts of spirituality.\nAfter he finished reading Mr. Azik's letter, Klein rubbed his fingers together and ignited a flame of spirituality. He burned the paper to ash and threw it into the rubbish bin.\nIt was already deep into the night and Klein was in no hurry to try the ritual. He intended to first make a plan and go through everything that he needed to take note of before putting it into practice.\nHe had a vague understanding of his shortcomings long ago. He was cautious and rational when it came to things he made plans for, but once the events deviated from his original plans, he would easily consider only the good and disregard the bad when he was forced to be on his toes.\nA simpler description would be that a rash action of his would easily cause him to court death... Klein extended his palm to cover his face.\nThe next day, Dunn Smith, who had communicated with the Mandated Punishers and Machinery Hivemind, started to assign missions. Klein also received his assignment. He was tasked to investigate a number of people who had connections to Lanevus. But because of his suggestion and the policy of the Nighthawks, he didn't have to be responsible for the people he had met previously.\nOf course, Klein continued with his combat lessons in the afternoon. Nor did Dunn assign him the role of lead investigator.\n...\nBacklund, Hillston Backlund. In a building with a horse stable and garden.\nQilangos, who had a unique wide chin and dark green eyes, looked at the unconscious man before him. He took off the man's clothes and wore them.\nHe then leisurely walked in front of the dressing mirror and saw the black glove on his left hand twitch. He saw many contorted lines appearing on its back.\nA few seconds later, Qilangos saw a thin veil of light envelop his figure. His muscles, skin, and bones began undergoing a strange transformation.\nSometime later, he transformed into the unconscious man, completely identical in height, appearance, and demeanor!","24":"On the undulating sea, inside an ancient and dark sailboat.\nAlger Wilson stood in front of a window, considering the report he had to produce when he arrived at Pasu Island. It was at that moment when the endless gray fog and a figure lording over him appeared.\nHe then saw a dark red glow and saw a blurry figure resembling The World. He then heard the figure's calm words.\nAfter hearing it, Alger's eyes widened. He found it difficult to suppress his joy as a strong sense of bewilderment and shock emerged within his heart.\nHe remembered very clearly that The World had only promised The Sun to obtain the Notary potion formula within three days at the last Tarot Club gathering. He hadn't mentioned anything related to the Ocean Songster potion formula, but in just days, this gentleman had obtained the rare Sequence 5 formula and even its main ingredient!\nWhat did he do exactly?Alger muttered silently to himself as he couldn't help but recall Gehrman Sparrow's cold and formidable appearance. He found the man more and more unfathomable.\nIs this the advantage of being a Blessed? Yes, I just received the news yesterday that Gehrman Sparrow boarded the Future last week in Nas. On the one hand, it proves that Admiral of Stars is indeed The Hermit, and on the other hand, it means that what The World did last week was extremely important. For example, entering those dangerous waters in the eastern front to obtain something. Therefore, he had no choice but to seek The Hermit's help? As such, he advanced and became a Sequence 5 powerhouse?\nThis can explain how he obtained the Ocean Songster potion formula and its main ingredient in the span of a few days... But what did he do exactly? Don't tell me that he killed someone from the middle-upper echelons of the Church?Alger couldn't help but frown.\nHe quickly calmed his heart as he focused on another matter.\nAlthough instantly obtaining the formula and main ingredient delighted and excited him, making him feel that becoming a Tarot Club member was a turning point in his life, he still needed to pay for it!\nWhat can I give The World...Alger fell into deep thought, depressed to realize that he didn't have any items or money of equal value.\nHe subconsciously paced about his window.\n...\nAbove the gray fog, the busy World vanished as Klein cast his eyes on Groselle's Travels which he had brought above the gray fog.\nThis book comprised of yellowish-brown goatskin was silently placed on the long bronze table. It didn't appear special in any way, appearing so ordinary that only history fans would notice it.\nKlein conjured a pen and paper as he cautiously wrote the first divination statement: \"This is the Spectator pathway's Uniqueness.\"\nHe was most worried about this point, as it meant that he couldn't seal the book above the gray fog. It might bring about unexpected accidents, but carrying it with him made it possible for him to be sucked into the book at any time. That would be very problematic.\nHe undid the spirit pendulum on his left wrist, composed himself, and attempted a divination.\nWhen he opened his eyes, the topaz pendant was spinning counterclockwise.\nIt meant a negative result.\nFrom the looks of it, this strange book isn't the Spectator pathway's Uniqueness. Then, there's no need to be too afraid...Klein thought for a few seconds before divining if Groselle's Travels was the corresponding item of the Spectator pathway's Sequence 1 or 2. To his surprise, the divination ended in a failure.\nHmm...he thought for a long while before penning a new divination statement: \"Its origins.\"\nThe reason why Klein dared to do such a divination was because he knew very well that the Spectator pathway's Sequence 0 had long perished. There was a high chance that the Uniqueness was in the hands of the Twilight Hermit Order. Therefore, the chances of him having to face a real god was negligible.\nPutting down the pen and holding the paper and book, Klein leaned back into the chair and recited the divination statement as he entered a dream with Cogitation.\nThe gray, hazy world cracked open as the sky turned extremely dark. It was as though strong winds were stirring the dark clouds.\nIn this dark environment, a sliver of light appeared first along the horizon as it grew bigger and clearer.\nIt was a floating continent!\nIt was a huge continent that could hold several cities!\nThe continent's periphery was grayish-white in color. Huge boulders revealed their outlines, and above them, there were dozens of erect hundred-meter-tall stone columns. They either stood independently or propped up magnificent ancient palaces.\nDragons of different colors-grayish-white, scarlet-red, yellowish-bronze-as well as some made of ice, were flying over the continent and the one-of-a-kind city. At times, they would land on a stone column to rest as they overlooked the land. At other times, they would enter the opulent palace and vanish from Klein's sight.\nAmong them, the smallest one was about the size of King of the North Ulyssan. The biggest spanned a hundred meters.\nThe scene quickly zoomed in as a palace with a height of over two hundred meters occupied Klein's vision.\nIts interior had stone columns erected, propping up a dome. The space was so large that it allowed any dragon to move freely within.\nThe \"camera\" kept moving inward, and soon, Klein saw a book made of yellowish-brown goatskin. Its cover was blank as it floated in midair. Compared to its surroundings, it was amazingly small.\nRight behind the book, a large shadow appeared.\nJust as the shadow's silhouette was outlined, Klein felt his thoughts instantly explode!\nHis eyes spewed out with blood as his ears were left with two black holes. His mouth and nostrils had white matter stained with blood spew out from them.\nThe mysterious space above the gray fog gently trembled as it pacified everything. Klein quickly recovered as he gritted his teeth and rubbed his head.\nIt hurts! It freaking hurts!\nIt's in no way inferior to the Eternal Blazing Sun. I didn't even discern \u2018His' looks or gain any knowledge...\nWas \"He\" Dragon of Imagination Ankewelt? According to Little Sun's information, \"He\" had perished at the end of the Second Epoch. After so many epochs, spanning two to three millennia, just prying into the mystery was enough to put me in such a sorry state. If not for the gray fog's screening and assistance, I would've died immediately... This mark is way too powerful, isn't it?\nThere's no way of comparing them. Its damage is inferior to the previous encounter with the Eternal Blazing Sun, but one had died long ago, while the other is still alive. It just begs the question if the ancient gods are stronger than the real gods of the present day...\nUsing nearly a minute to recover from the pain, Klein recast his gaze on Groselle's Travels. He tapped the mottled table's edge and muttered silently,This book's \"author\" is Dragon of Imagination Ankewelt?\nA book written by an ancient god, a storybook that can automatically deduce the ending?\nWhat is \"His\" goal? When this book was formed, the Dragon of Imagination likely hadn't encountered the ancient sun god and was fine. After all, it would take some time to go from the City of Miracles, Liveseyd, to the Giant King's Court. And before Groselle was swallowed by the book, the Giant King's Court was clearly still in existence.\nJust a prank? A toy used to kill \"His\" boredom? Or could it be that the Dragon of Imagination had foreseen some of the future. \"He\" specially created this book to leave behind a chance for \"Himself\" or the dragons to resurrect. However, he underestimated the ancient sun god's might, and he completely perished. It made the book unusable for millennia, so all it could do was naturally absorb characters into it to play out a story?\nKlein made some guesses, but he wasn't able to verify them. After some consideration, he thought of finding a chance to enter the book in search for clues.\nIn the future, I can enter as a Spirit Body above the gray fog. Once I encounter any trouble, I'll immediately return... Yes, I'll make the attempt after I'm no longer with Edwina and Anderson. I have to be careful and cautious...Klein nodded as he divined if leaving Groselle's Travels above the gray fog would bring undesirable changes to the mysterious space, but he was met with failure again.\nAs for the reason, he actually knew why. This was a place that transcended the spirit world. Divining about matters involving this area naturally failed if attempts were made to obtain revelations from the spirit world.\nAfter deciding to frequently come above the gray fog to take a look so as to prevent any accidents, Klein threw Groselle's Travels into the junk pile. He then waved his hand, summoning a golden wine cup that had been partially flattened.\nThe cup had complicated patterns engraved on it, with the Elvish phrases \"Calamity\" and \"Cohinem.\" Apart from that, there wasn't anything special.\nWith it in hand, Klein silently rubbed it for a few seconds.\n...\nKnock, knock, knock!\nKlein politely knocked on the door to the captain's cabin.\n\"Is there something?\" Edwina, who had let down her hair, looked at Gehrman Sparrow and asked.\nKlein handed over the elf queen's golden wine cup.\n\"Put this in Siatas's tomb.\"\n\"... Alright.\" Edwina fell silent for two seconds before nodding and receiving it.\nShe habitually studied the engravings and symbols on the cup before withdrawing her gaze in embarrassment. She then looked out the window and said, \"They'll be organizing a bonfire party. Will you be participating?\"\n\"No.\" Klein shook his head.\n\"I understand. I don't plan on participating either. Not everyone is like Anderson, who can quickly raise his spirits,\" Edwina said with pursed lips.\nActually, it's not necessarily a bad thing...Klein was momentarily at a loss for a response. And apart from \"giving lessons,\" Edwina wasn't good at socializing. Immediately, the two of them fell silent.\nAbout ten seconds later, Klein silently inhaled and broke the silence.\n\"Are you selling that key that originates from the giants?\"\n\"Yes.\" Edwina thought about it before glancing at her collector's room. She added, \"I can lend it to you for studying. You can decide whether to buy it before leaving the ship.\"","25":"Seeing the white foam of the Southville beer being placed in front of Sherlock Moriarty, Carlson finally came to his senses.\nIt was only when the bartender was a certain distance away from them did he ask in a suppressed voice, \"What do you want?\"\nKlein picked up his glass and took a sip. He took a few seconds to savor the bitter taste of the malt and the faint sweetness from it.\n\"Cheers!\" He looked sideways at Carlson and smiled before raising his glass.\nWithout hesitation, Carlson shook his head and refused the offer, mumbling, \"You have beer, while I have strong distilled liquor. It's not suitable for a toast.\"\nKlein was only going through the motions, so he once again took a sip of his Southville beer, looked straight ahead, and chuckled.\n\"What I want is very simple.\n\"I'm not sure what's inside the tomb, so I can only describe it rather vaguely... Well, I hope that I can choose an item from the spoils of your tomb exploration. I'm not greedy, and my request will not involve high Sequence items. I wouldn't dare to take it even if they were one of the options.\n\"If you find nothing or there are only high Sequence items, then I don't want anything. Of course, I believe that when the latter happens, you wouldn't be stingy with giving me a sum of cash that's consistent with my contribution.\"\nAfter hearing about the Amon family's tomb from Miss Sharron yesterday, he had came up with rough plans.\nThe first plan was to blow the copper whistle, contact Mr. Azik, and join forces to explore the tomb.\nHowever, there were many potential problems with this plan. Firstly, he was unsure of the amount of strength Azik, who was still in the midst of finding his lost memories, had regained. Secondly, Azik was being pursued by MI9, so it was very easy for him and Azik to land in trouble. Thirdly, there was a high chance that Klein would end up reappearing in the sights of Sealed Artifact 0-08 once again. Of course, he could also consider using the help of the gray fog to make contact or embark on the expedition. However, blowing the copper whistle above the gray fog made it impossible to summon the messenger; therefore, ending all of his subsequent plans.\nMore importantly, Klein didn't dare to reveal the secret of the space above the fog to Azik Eggers whose identity remained a mystery.\nTherefore, he finally chose the second method, which was to use his identity as an informant to submit the information to the Machinery Hivemind and ask for a reasonable reward.\nWhen it came to the number of High-Sequence Beyonders, which faction could have more than the seven Churches?\nAccording to what Klein knew, there were close to ten High-Sequence Beyonders in the Church of the Evernight Goddess. In other words, nearly half of the thirteen archbishops and nine high-ranking deacons had reached or surpassed Sequence 4. This wasn't considering the adorer of the Goddess, the Pope who helmed the Church.\nEven if the situation regarding the Church of the God of Steam and Machinery was inferior in this aspect, it couldn't be that inferior. Their archbishop of the Backlund diocese, Horamick Haydn, was a High-Sequence Beyonder.\nAnd as such, for an orthodox church, with all its resources accumulated to date, it wouldn't value the Mid-Sequence items very, very, very much. Klein believed that he could negotiate a reasonable \"price.\"\nSimply put, the core element of the second plan was: find an organization for any difficulties!\nUpon hearing Klein's offer, Carlson paused for a second, then blurted out, \"Aren't you a believer in God?\"\nI've always had the Goddess in my heart...Klein drew a triangular Sacred Emblem on his chest.\n\"It is because of my belief in God that I've told you this information, not to the Nighthawks through Mr. Stanton.\n\"God said to let those who wish to be strong, be strong. Only by becoming stronger and having more money can I have more access to different channels and resources, and thus provide you with better and more effective information.\"\nIn order to convince the Machinery Hivemind, he had specifically spent the morning reading through the \"Steam and Machinery Bible\" that he had bought earlier. He then found a few sentences from the deity that met his requirements and memorized them.\nCarlson was momentarily unable to provide a rejoinder. He just sat there, stunned, to the point of forgetting to drink.\nSeeing this, Klein quickly added, \"Moreover, this will help you establish a harmonious and efficient relationship with new-generation informants. As long as you spread the news of the rewards I receive as a result of this, as well as keeping your promise without going back on your word, then I believe that the other informants will be deeply moved and be greatly motivated to do their best to gather useful information for you.\n\"Of course, I wish that you use my pseudonym when advertising this.\"\nCarlson listened with a blank face, picked up his glass, and gulped down a mouthful. He almost choked.\n\"Cough. Sherlock, the real you is completely different from what I remember about you from before.\" He sighed.\nThe Detective Sherlock Moriarty in his memories was good at analysis and reasoning, he was extremely calm and polite, and, with a great sense of justice, had offered very effective advice. He was an outstanding believer in God.\nYet now, he was...\nKlein took a sip of his beer and chuckled.\n\"Everyone has their different sides. Using a single facade to face everything is prone to error. This is a problem you have to pay attention to when making deductions.\"\nAfter calming down for a moment, Carlson stood up and said, \"I have no right to agree to such a request. I will report it immediately, so wait here for a while.\"\n\"Alright.\" Klein waved to the bartender and added a serving of potato wedges.\nBy the time he leisurely finished his food and beer, Carlson returned to the bar with the deacon of the Machinery Hivemind, Ikanser Bernard.\nIkanser looked around, and seeing that there was no one around, he said in a deep voice, \"There's no problem with your request, but there's one condition to add on-items with strong side effects and curses are not among the items available for selection.\"\nWhat I want is an ingredient...Klein immediately laughed.\n\"Alright!\n\"Dare I ask again if is this your personal decision or the response from the higher-ups?\"\n\"I have the right to make such a decision.\" Ikanser used his hat to press down on his fluffy hair. \"But since it concerns an aristocratic tomb from the Fourth Epoch, I had sent a telegram to the archbishop, and he didn't object to it in his reply.\"\n\"Alright.\" Klein drew another triangular Sacred Emblem on his chest. \"I'll give you the information now.\"\nIkanser shook his head subconsciously.\nHe looked around and pointed to a billiard room.\n\"Let's talk inside.\"\nThis deacon, who is always publicly placed on trial by the mirror called Arrodes, is quite experienced...Klein murmured and followed Ikanser and Carlson into the billiard room while making sure that the adjacent rooms were empty.\nKlein paused for a few seconds and said with some deliberation, \"The thing is, there was a Beyonder who found a hidden tomb at the mouth of the Stratford River in White Cliff Town. He searched the periphery and found some items.\n\"After that, they recruited people and did further explorations, but no one returned. If you search carefully over there, you will definitely find the corresponding traces.\"\nAfter listening carefully, Ikanser asked, \"Are you sure it's an aristocratic tomb from the Fourth Epoch?\"\n\"The items on the outside can prove that they're members of the Tudor Dynasty's Amon family,\" Klein answered truthfully. He then warned him, \"The Beyonders who died in there weren't weak at all, and there were quite a few of them. I believe that this tomb isn't something that can be explored by those below High-Sequence Beyonders.\"\n\"Amon...\" Ikanser frowned instinctively.\nIt could be seen that, as a deacon, he had the authority to know some ancient secret history.\nWithout waiting for Klein to emphasize it again, he looked up and said, \"We will collect the relevant information first before we act.\"\n\"A Fourth Epoch aristocratic tomb is very dangerous. Don't tell this information to anyone else, or explore it yourself. Otherwise, you and your friends will only lose their lives.\"\nIf I dared, I wouldn't be sitting here...Klein gave a self-deprecating laugh and said, \"My reputation has always been good.\"\nAfter making the deal, he watched Ikanser and Carlson leave before putting on his hat and sauntering out of Lucky Bar.\nTowards the nobles of the Fourth Epoch, as well as the Amon family, the Machinery Hivemind will still be very cautious. They'll have to have at least several days of preparing before they take action... Prudence...Klein's random thoughts froze on a single word.\nHe thought of another thing that could be described as being prudent.\nAfter Roselle had joined the ancient organization suspected of being the Twilight Hermit Order, he had actually never mentioned its name in his own secret diary which was written in Chinese. Each time, he would refer to it by referring to it with the appropriate characteristics.\nThis level of prudence was a very suspicious phenomenon!\nWhy didn't Emperor Roselle dare to mention the name of that organization, even when it's written in Chinese? This is completely different from the style of writing where he dared to write anything in his diary... What was he afraid of, or what was he worried about? Could it be that as long as he said or wrote down the name of the Twilight Hermit Order, then they would be made aware of it it no matter which language he used? Does one of their members or a Sealed Artifact they possess have such abilities?A guess popped up in Klein's mind, but there was no way to confirm it unless he was willing to take the risk.\nI'll first assume it's true and that I haven't been perceived by them, because the channeling of the Desire Apostle's spirit had been done above the gray fog. Informing Miss Justice of it was also done in response to a prayer using the gray fog... Well, it's almost Monday, and I have to remind Miss Justice at the Tarot Club not to say or write down the name \"Twilight Hermit Order.\" As for the reason, she can understand it by herself with me simply giving her a look...Klein quickly made his next arrangements and strode out of Lucky Bar.\nSeeing that it was still early, he took a horse carriage to the Quelaag Club, intending to spend the afternoon there.\nAs soon as he entered the hall, he saw the equestrian teacher, Talim Dumont.\nThis descendant of blue-blood was seated in a corner, holding a glass of scarlet grape wine. His face was rosy, and he was sipping it in high spirits.\n\"You seem to be in a good mood, Talim,\" Klein smiled and greeted him.\nTalim chuckled and said, \"Because the new year is coming.\"\nThen, rather excitedly, he asked, \"Sherlock, do you know what it's like to really like someone?\"\n\"...\" Klein showed a fake smile.\n\"I'm sorry, I'm still single.\"\nTalim finished the rest of his wine, stood up, waved his hand, and said, \"That's a pity. Well, I have to get busy.\"\n\"By the way, thank you for introducing Mr. Framis Cage,\" Klein recalled the investment of the bike project and sincerely expressed his gratitude. \"When are you free these days? I'd like to get you to bring me around to sample some of Backlund's delicacies.\"\n\"After the new year.\" Talim put on his hat and walked with a smile to the reception hall.\nHas this fellow entered the season of love?Klein couldn't help but mutter.\nJust as he turned around and took a few steps, he suddenly heard a heavy thud.\nKlein jerked his head back and saw Talim Dumont on the ground, his left hand clamped tightly at his chest where his heart was. His body was convulsing nonstop.\nThis...Klein hurried over.\nBut at this moment, Talim had already spat out all of the white foam on his mouth, losing his last breath of life.\nIn just a few seconds, he had turned into a dead corpse.","26":"\"What? He knows me?\" the chubby Apothecary, Darkwill, was alarmed as he whispered back.\nThe owl's round eyes looked ahead and said, \"I noticed that he clearly paused for two seconds the moment he saw you when he came in.\"\n\"Perhaps he thinks someone like me doesn't match his image of an Apothecary?\" the chubby Apothecary retorted.\nThe owl spread its wings and landed.\n\"Suit yourself if you wish to think so.\"\n\"... What books have you been reading recently?\" The fat on the chubby Apothecary's face trembled.\nThe owl replied sternly and seriously, \"My reading is based on your knowledge standards such as those involving soccer.\n\"Unfortunately, the words you grasp and can teach me are limited. I have no choice but to read popular novels that have a lower requirement on one's vocabulary.\n\"Besides, they're all serialized on the newspaper.\"\nDarkwill chuckled.\n\"I'll buy a recipe cookbook later. It's called Guide to East Balam Bird Culinary Methods.\"\nWithout waiting for the owl to answer, his expression sank and he muttered to himself, \"He knows me? He looks like the standard Loenese man. More than half his blood is at least Loen.\n\"I used a fake name to stay in a few cities in Loen. It's not odd to be recognized by him. But I still need to be on guard. If I don't receive any news about Old Man before March, then I have to leave this place...\"\nHaving said that, he turned his head to look at the owl who was perched on his shoulder.\n\"At times, you're still rather useful.\"\n\"No, your eyes and your body language tells me that your real thoughts are \u2018darn it. I wanted to buy a pet that can help me beat monsters and gangsters. I sought out Beyonder ingredients of a potion recipe according to the standards of a dragon, but I ended up getting a silly bird who only knows how to read newspapers and plays. Darn it. I want to stuff another potion down its throat!'\" the owl repeated like a parrot by mimicking the chubby Apothecary's tone.\nDarkwill's expression stiffened for a few seconds before he chuckled.\n\"It's good that you know this, silly bird!\n\"If I didn't have the powers of a Beast Tamer, you wouldn't have even managed a single potion!\"\nInside the herb store, the man and bird fell into silence.\nAfter a while, the owl pretended as though nothing had happened as it asked, \"Darkwill, is it really going to work? You've already entrusted this to dozens of adventurers.\"\n\"I'm not good at finding people, so I can only entrust it to someone else. Besides, they have to find and confirm Old Man's location before I make a payment. I don't even need to spend a single penny!\" the chubby Apothecary tsked as he said before he sighed. \"Old Man always calls himself a lucky person and a winner of fate. He should be fine...\"\n...\n\"Will the medicine brewed from this really be effective?\" While returning to the Wind of Azure Inn via carriage, Danitz looked at the paper bag beside Klein.\nThe things inside were black herbs, strangely-shaped insect carapaces, and weirdly-colored flowers. It didn't seem like anything reliable.\nKlein nodded.\n\"Yes.\"\n\"You haven't drunk it...\" Danitz subconsciously retorted.\nI trust him. Although his mouth stinks and is rather vile, he has a rather kind heart... Besides, Captain Elland believes that his medicine is sufficiently effective...As Gehrman Sparrow, Klein didn't respond to Danitz's doubts. He directly picked up the paper bag and threw it over.\nWithout needing any spoken words, Danitz knew what he meant. He was in charge of brewing the medicine.\nFurthermore, he was accustomed to doing similar matters recently, so he didn't have any urges to resist.\nAfter returning to the Wind of Azure Inn, Klein got a chair to sit in while he watched Danitz light up the fireplace and prop up a pot. He then added water and the herbs into it.\nLeaning back, Klein felt his head feel groggy. He was very exhausted and felt like he could fall asleep at any moment.\nIn order to wait for the medicine to finish brewing and for him to quickly resolve his illness, he forced himself to consider various problems to combat the fatigue.\nOn careful consideration, during the battle with Vice Admiral Ailment, if I hadn't succeeded in sneaking in an attack on her and suppressing her from the very beginning, preventing her from getting into her rhythm until she eventually found a chance to force open a gap between us by turning invisible, then I might've not been her match.\nThe two powers of invisibility and ailments are really like a bug in a game. Matched with an Assassin's lethal strike, and the interference of pleasure, it really makes one unable to find and hit her or escape. One can only watch their body gradually weaken and become inflicted with all sorts of ailments. One can even get mesmerized and give up resisting...\nOn the one hand, it's because every Sequence 5 is very powerful. As expected of the Sequence just before a demigod. On the other hand, it's because Creeping Hunger's various powers aren't a good match. It cannot be considered to be multifaceted without any weaknesses.\nYes. The powers of a Sequence 5 Nimblewright Master of the Seer pathway is highly effective against invisibility...\nI can try to help the chubby Apothecary find his teacher in the meantime, but without any information, with just a picture, I can only try my luck. I'll have to see when I can directly find a clue. After all, I'm not a god, and I can't find people remotely...\nWait, in a certain way, I am a god!\nI can get Sea God believers to help find him. As long as that old gentleman named Roy King once visited Bayam, he would've definitely encountered others and be seen by them. Most native residents secretly believe in Sea God... This is what it means by a sea of people...\nAlso, before Captain Elland leaves Bayam, I should get him to introduce me to a point of contact for the military. In the future, I can get him to reimburse me for any intel. They can also check if there were any travelers named Roy King, who registered on any liners in recent months.\nThere's another method. I've placed the radio transceiver above the gray fog for some time. I should be able to contact the magic mirror, Arrodes, if I take it down. I was originally planning on asking for Helene's location, but I no longer need to find the red-haired lady anymore. I can switch to Roy King.\nHehe, for a matter which many adventurers have no clue on how to begin, I have three solutions!\n...\nAmidst his thoughts, Klein finally held on until the medicine was successfully brewed.\nLooking at the bottle of blackish-green liquid that Danitz brought over, he hesitated for two seconds before extending his hand to receive it and placed it to his mouth.\nGulp!\nKlein immediately felt his throat burn as his face flushed red.\nThis made him recall his attempt at eating crazy spicy food in his previous life.\nSuddenly, his entire person awakened as his stuffy nose quickly cleared.\nGulp! Gulp...He barely finished drinking it and felt as though he had nearly recovered from his sickness.\nBy night time, he had fully recovered. He no longer showed any doubt towards an Apothecary's abilities.\nNo wonder the potion's name is ApothecaryKlein wore his hat and left the inn with Danitz. Under the cloak of night, they left Bayam and came to a secret harbor hidden on the other end of the jungle.\nTonight, the Golden Dream was providing aid to the Resistance.\nAfter some coordination and hassle, Danitz used the Soulfall Ritual to contact Vice Admiral Iceberg Edwina.\nAfter some time, the ship, that was often scrubbed clean and had a strange main cannon, docked by the private harbor. Its gigantic sails drew five types of gold coins. They were the gold pound of Loen, the gold hoorn of Feysac, the verl gold of Intis, the gold risot of Feynapotter, and the sassen gold of Lenburg.\nThis was the flag of the Golden Dream, it was also the symbol of this pirate crew.\nIt's still not professional enough. If it were me, I would add porter gold from Masin, z\u0142oty from Segar, motif gold coins from Balam Empire, etc...Klein stood by the side with his hands in his pocket as he watched Edwina Edwards appear at the bow.\nAt that moment, she was wearing a hunter's hat, a rider's shirt, and a black coat. She matched the image of a female pirate admiral in the minds of the Resistance.\nShe often dresses like she's a private tutor...Klein mumbled and took a few steps back, allowing Danitz to run around and busy himself.\nThis pirate worth 5,500 pounds did the liaison, sending a batch of food and fabric to Kalat and the Resistance before the transaction came to a close.\nDanitz secretly inhaled and came to Klein's side and forced a smile.\n\"There's nothing else, right?\n\"I can now return to the Golden Dream, right?\n\"Also, how do you plan on settling the hiring fee?\"\nThat's only an excuse your captain and I used. In a particular sense, this batch of food and fabric is my payment...Klein nodded.\n\"Your Captain has already paid.\n\"You can return.\"\n\"For real?\" Danitz found it unbelievable.\nAlthough Vice Admiral Iceberg Edwina wasn't far behind him, he was still afraid that Gehrman Sparrow would suddenly have a crazy fit.\nKlein didn't reply and turned around, walking straight towards the path that led out of the private harbor.\nDanitz exhaled silently and held back his excited feelings before briskly running back to the Golden Dream.\nOnly when the Golden Dream steered far away into the night, with the private harbor that belonged to the Resistance slowly shrinking in size, did he really believe that he was back on the Golden Dream.\nAt that instant, he felt that he had experienced just too many things over the past half a month or so. It was an unprecedented level of exhilaration, as though it was an interesting dream.\nAt this moment, a sailor came close and asked out of curiosity, \"Boss, was Steel Maveti really killed by you?\"\nDanitz immediately laughed out loud and secretly stole a glance at Captain Edwina before saying to his subordinate, \"I contributed greatly to this deed. Let's talk over drinks!\"\nAbove the dark sea, the Golden Dream drifted off into the distance.\n...\nAfter returning to the Wind of Azure Inn, Klein was just about to sleep when he saw the surrounding colors turn abnormally bright.\nThe white bedsheets turned whiter, and the brown floorboards turned more brownish-yellow. The dark red curtains appeared like fresh blood...\nIn the scene with all sorts of colors stacked upon each other, Azik Eggers suddenly walked out from a rippling aqueous void.\nHe was dressed in his usual shirt, bow tie, tailcoat, and a top hat. His skin was bronze in color, and he had soft facial features.\nHow enviable... I also wish to have such powers of traveling through the spirit world...Klein silently sighed as he smiled in greeting while maintaining his appearance.\n\"Good evening, Mr. Azik.\"\nAzik took off his top hat and looked at the rather unfamiliar face. Without finding it strange, he chuckled.\n\"Apologies. I came in a hurry. I should've knocked on the door.\n\"What's the exact situation with those Death chronicles?\"\nKlein invited him to have a seat. He then described in detail things he couldn't explain in the letter. Towards the end, he mentioned in passing about the matter regarding Bansy Harbor, saying how it involved King of Angels Medici and \"His\" descendants.\nAzik leaned back into the chair and said with a frown, \"There's such a name in my memories. \u2018He' should have the two titles of Red Angel and War Angel...\n\"However, \u2018He' had perished long ago.\"\n\"Perished long ago?\" Klein asked in surprise.\nAzik nodded and thought over it.\n\"I remember that \u2018He' was killed by Blood Emperor Alista Tudor.\"\nKilled by Blood Emperor Alista Tudor?Klein's pupils shrank as he recalled the evil spirit that loitered in the underground ruins beneath Backlund.\nIt had claimed to be an innocent killed by the Blood Emperor!","27":"One syllable after another of distorted, incomprehensible, jarring, and indecipherable words slowly spewed out of Klein's mouth. It made the hurricane produced by the bronze door's terrifying suction force to instantly calm down, cloaking the already dim surroundings with a deeper gloom.\nOnly at this moment did he know that the Beyonder power which Admiral Hell Ludwell had just used was known as the Language of the Dead. It could circumvent the protection of one's flesh and blood, so as to target the Spirit Body.\nIt belonged to an advancement in a Spirit Medium's powers. It could go from direct communication with spirits to that of commandeering, to the point of enslavement!\nLiving creatures were unable to understand the resounding language. Ludwell couldn't help but freeze on the spot. A transparent layer rapidly surfaced on his pirate captain attire.\nHis spirit was being tugged at by an illusory power!\nAt this moment, the black, square-shaped ring on Ludwell's left index finger produced a faint glow.\nThe minute portion of his Spirit Body which had been forcefully drawn out had returned to his body as the two fused back into one.\nDing!\nWith his right hand, Ludwell drew the thin rapier hanging by his waist.\nIt was iron-black in color, and its tip gathered the surrounding light, turning into a dark point.\nAdmiral Hell suddenly took a step forward and with vigorous wind currents, he suddenly closed the distance between him and Klein. Immediately, he thrust out the rapier in his hand at lightning speed!\nThe bronze door which was covered with mysterious patterns remained standing erected in its original spot. It didn't vanish because of Ludwell's retracting of his left hand and subsequent actions. This was different from the similar-looking ability that Miss Sharron had previously cast using a mystical item.\nOof!\nThe black rapier pierced through Klein in an unavoidable manner.\nKlein's figure rapidly crumpled into a piece of paper. Its surface turned yellow and dry, as though it had been weathered for thousands of years.\nThe hurricane brought about by the bronze door completely pulverized the paper figurine.\nIn midair, Klein jumped out of the darkness as he held a huge handful of charms from the Sea God domain.\n\"Storm!\"\nHe quickly shouted in ancient Hermes as the tin flakes lit up individually as they sacrificed themselves to Sea God. This also meant that if Klein wished so, he could recycle most of the materials and use it multiple times until the metals could no longer withstand the spirituality.\nWhoosh!\nBlue wind blades shot out as the surrounding waters sprayed out heavy waves that were as tall as the ship. As Klein didn't attempt or have the time to distinguish between the different kinds of charms, while these attacks inundated Ludwell, the extraordinary effects also augmented Admiral Hell. He was given augmented effects like Underwater Breathing, underwater mobility, flight, and pressure resistance, none of which were useful at that moment.\nLudwell suddenly opened his mouth and produced a silent screech. He then struck the waves beside him as countless wind blades temporarily froze in midair.\nImmediately following that, Admiral Hell raised his left hand as the black, square-shaped ring on his index finger produced a sinister and eerie glow that instantly brightened.\nWhoosh!\nThe bronze door, which exuded an indescribable feeling, instantly swelled as it doubled in height and width.\nAmidst a heavy creaking sound, the gap in the door opened up. The already terrifying suction force immediately rose to an unimaginable level.\nBlue wind blades and black sea waves were produced as Klein charged at the door from the air, heading straight for the strange vines and arms that extended outwards.\nKlein had planned on using the Priest of Light by clashing head-on with the bronze door with Light of Holiness to catch a breather, but he ended up seeing a glaring white fireball about half the height of a person fly over.\nThe fireball's speed was augmented by the ridiculous suction forces generated by the door. It flew by Klein and smashed at the gap of the mysterious door.\nBoom!\nThe white flames scattered as they rained down, but all it did was make the bronze door quake a little and dim a little.\nKlein took the opportunity and snapped his fingers.\nThe few matchsticks he separated in his pockets immediately lit up as scarlet flames rapidly enveloped his body as he melted away.\nA flame burst out by the side of the bronze door as Klein leaped out of it.\nHe instantly noticed that Anderson Hood was floating in midair in a rather awkward manner. He held a burning-white spear in his palm.\nThe Strongest Hunter had finally arrived, but he just appeared unaccustomed to flying.\nWhen Ludwell looked up and saw this scene, the pale-white flames behind the silver mask clearly jumped twice.\nClearly, he never expected that the Future had two other powerhouses at the pirate admiral level apart from Admiral of Stars Cattleya. Furthermore, they wielded pretty good mystical items and Sealed Artifacts.\nAt this moment, Ludwell suddenly raised his hand and pressed down on his face, surprisingly taking off his silver mask.\nHeavy, pale-white light suddenly spewed out from behind the mask, causing endless silence to instantly spread out from the black, square-shaped ring on Ludwell's left index finger.\nThe silence surged into the bronze door and lifted it off the deck and into the air.\nThe door covered in mysterious patterns fused with the endless silence as it rapidly burgeoned to more than thirty meters tall.\nWith the sea as its base, it stood there, erect like an entrance to another world, one completely different from the present world.\nCreak!\nThe bronze door opened as unspeakable darkness surged out and enveloped the Black Tulip's bow.\nUpon seeing this, Klein didn't focus on his attacks as he quickly took out the correct charm and rapidly used it on himself.\nA strong gust of wind swept over and lifted him above the Black Tulip.\nWith the pull of the darkness, the gigantic sailboat steered into the bronze door, ten meters a time, as it sailed into another world.\nAdmiral Hell Ludwell stood at the bow as he looked up into the sky. His face was blanketed by the pale-white luster, preventing anyone from discerning his looks.\nHis gaze first swept past Klein before landing on Anderson Hood. He seemed to make a mental note of these two hunters, but he didn't make any further attempts to attack. He seemed to have been restrained by the surrounding darkness.\nAnderson was taken aback as he didn't hesitate to throw out the burning-white spear in his hand.\nThe spear shot straight at Ludwell, but once it entered the region enclosed by darkness and silence, it silently vanished.\nLudwell is planning to escape? How decisive...Klein was first stunned before he recalled that Azik's copper whistle was still on the Black Tulip.\nWith the gigantic sailboat halfway inside the bronze door and about to enter another world with no way to stop them, Klein threw a matchstick and snapped his fingers.\nHe appeared fifty meters above the stern where the undead creatures were fighting for Azik's copper whistle. This item which kept changing hands finally burst into a scarlet flame due to the matchsticks tied to it.\nAmidst the flames, Klein's figure surfaced there and grabbed Azik's copper whistle.\nThis was the preparations that he had made for retrieving the copper whistle!\nFurthermore, to prevent any mishaps from happening, such as the matchsticks being pulled away by the undead creatures, he had also coated the copper whistle with an easily flammable essential oil of the sun!\nPa!\nSurrounded by countless undead, Klein didn't have the luxury of time to retract his hand that grabbed the copper whistle. He immediately snapped his fingers again.\nAt this moment, transparent, rotting, pale, or illusory hands grabbed him!\nThe matchstick Klein had previously thrown into the air ignited in midair as it produced a flame.\nHis figure quickly materialized amidst the flames. His face was livid and his lips were white.\nHaving been grabbed by countless shadows, wraiths, and undead creatures, Klein felt that the depths of his Spirit Body was ice-cold. He couldn't control his body as he plummeted into the sea dyed in gold.\nWith the Black Tulip almost completely crossing the bronze door, the sea which appeared like an entrance to hell had been restored to normal.\nKlein sank a few meters and swallowed a few mouthfuls of bitter and astringent seawater before he ultimately recovered.\nThankfully I was sufficiently prepared...As this thought flashed past his mind, he suddenly felt something amiss.\nBy wearing the Murloc Cufflink, he had the passive ability to breathe underwater for ten minutes. He shouldn't have drank mouthfuls of water!\nKlein suddenly turned his head and looked at his wrist, only to realize that the blue cufflink had detached itself at some point in time.\nIt's lost... Tinder lost it... I was on the Black Tulip the entire time...Klein splashed a few times and floated to the surface, just in time to see the gigantic sailboat's tail meld into the darkness as the bronze door slowly closed.\nHe instinctively swam forward a few seconds before ultimately stopping. He selected one of his remaining charms and gave himself the Beyonder effect of Underwater Breathing.\nIn midair, Anderson Hood clicked his tongue when he saw this.\n\"This fellow is really crazy...\n\"He's actually trying to engage in pursuit!\"\nAt this moment, the starlight above the Future fell and condensed into a long bridge that extended over.\nCattleya had finally finished off the grayish-black monster with immense vitality!\nWhat a pity. If only Admiral Hell had hesitated a little and didn't flee in such a timely fashion...Anderson Hood sighed silently and firmly landed on the star bridge.\nAs he watched Gehrman Sparrow fly over, he was just about to greet and praise him when he saw the cold and gloomy expression.\nAnderson instinctively made way and chuckled dryly, allowing Gehrman Sparrow to walk past him.\nAfter returning to the Future via the star bridge, Klein held back his effusing emotions and watched Frank Lee walk over and give him a thumbs up.\n\"You're the craziest fellow I've ever met!\n\"You actually dared to board the Black Tulip alone and single-handedly challenge Admiral Hell. You even returned alive!\"\nSorry, in terms of craziness, I'm far inferior to you...Klein thought in response.\nAt this moment, pirates with long or disheveled hair expressed their astonishment and amazement.\nIn such an atmosphere, Klein closed his eyes and felt his Faceless potion completely digest.","28":"\"The Fool?\" The Beyonders who attended Mr. A's gathering either ruminated over the phrase or conversed with their companions to discuss whether they had ever met anyone who had a similar faith.\n\"When did such a cult appear?\" someone asked in a low voice.\nAt this point, Mr. A made the attendant beside him hold up a blackboard with a few lines of words written in the Loen language.\n\"The Fool that doesn't belong to this era.\n\"The mysterious ruler above the gray fog.\n\"The King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck.\"\nAs the attendees examined the blackboard, Mr. A said in a hoarse and jarring voice, \"Do not use Hermes to read what's written here. Even more so for Jotun, Elvish, Dragonese, and ancient Hermes. You shouldn't even write the corresponding descriptions; otherwise, there is a high probability that something terrible will happen.\n\"Help me find believers in The Fool. Of course, they might also be followers of the mysterious ruler above the gray fog or the King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck. As long as there's a clue, inform me immediately. The reward I'll provide will be so handsome that it will far exceed your imagination!\"\n\"This description... It sounds like an incredible existence. I've only seen similar descriptions in the ancient texts of the seven gods!\" a gathering member exclaimed.\nHis companion shook his head and said, \"The beings which many cults believe in have similar descriptions.\"\n\"Is it really a cult?\" The other gathering members were stunned when they heard their discussion.\n\"Likely. Typically, when we summon a creature from the spirit world, we might have three lines describing it, but one of the lines would be about \u2018the blessed one of someone' or \u2018that who belongs to.' It wouldn't be in this format!\" A gathering member who was well-versed in mysticism gave an explanation.\nAs they vehemently conversed, Fors was nearly dumbfounded.\nIsn't that the honorific name of Mr. Fool? Even though it's described in the Loen language, I'm sure of it! Why would Mr. A want to find the believers of Mr. Fool? Is the Aurora Order behind this?Fors's mind was in a mess.\nShe knew that Mr. A was a member of the Aurora Order because of a particular \"terrorist organization\" had announced its responsibility in the assassination of Intis Ambassador Bakerland.\nAfter a brief moment of astonishment, Fors subconsciously began to examine herself, afraid that someone would discover that she was already a member of the Tarot Club and that, in some sense, she was an adorer of The Fool.\nI just recited the honorific name of The Fool according to the ancient Hermes on that piece of paper and was pulled above the gray fog. No one knows about this, and I don't have to be afraid of being investigated... But there's a link to that piece of paper with Mr. Fool's honorific name written on it. It was hidden in a book we borrowed from the Viscount Glaint...Thoughts rapidly flashed through Fors's mind.\nThe Fool that doesn't belong to this era... Isn't that the description I saw on that piece of paper? I even dreamed of an evil spirit!At the same time, Xio remembered the incident that had frightened her, but her long experience as a bounty hunter had kept her from revealing anything unusual.\nAnd then, as she recalled, she thought about the origin of the piece of paper.\nIt was hidden in the bookcase of \"History of the Loen Kingdom's Aristocracy\"... That book was borrowed from Viscount Glaint's study...\nSuddenly, a name flashed in both Fors's and Xio's minds at the same time:Viscount Glaint!\nAt that moment, Viscount Glaint was looking at the blackboard and said to himself with interest, \"This honorific name is very rare.\n\"But it sounds very impressive!\"\nJust as he finished his sentence, he looked to his side in puzzlement, asking Fors and Xio, \"Why are you looking at me like that?\"\n\"Nothing.\" Xio and Fors rapidly shook their heads at the same time.\n...\nAfter dinner, in an elegantly decorated house.\nAudrey brought the huge golden retriever, Susie, into the living room under the guidance of her psychology teacher, Escalante. She was attending the \"academic\" meeting that had been agreed upon last week.\nHer maid and bodyguard stayed behind while she walked with Susie into a spacious activity room.\nIn the activity room, be it for the atmosphere or some other reason, the gas lamps were not lit. The room was lit by gold-plated candle lamps on the coffee table and cupboard.\nBefore Audrey could take a good look at her surroundings, she saw a gentleman in his thirties walking towards her. He wore a gray tailcoat.\n\"This is the owner of this place, Mr. Stephen Hampres, a furniture merchant.\" the long-haired Escalante introduced him.\nShe was just about to tell him Audrey's identity when Hampres chuckled and said, \"Escalante, don't say anything. Let me have a chance at guessing.\"\nHe had a neatly trimmed mustache and charming dark brown eyes. He appeared very gentle and elegant, nothing like a furniture merchant but more like a university lecturer.\nAfter seriously sizing up Audrey a few times, he smiled and said, \"Escalante only mentioned that you were her student. Heh heh, I believe you're a cultured noble lady, and you aren't someone who only looks good. There's no need for you to worry about a decline in the quality of your life...\n\"You're a little excited, very curious, and a relatively simple but also full of love...\n\"Of course, the most obvious point is that you're very beautiful, just like an angel!\"\nHe made a final joke, pressed his hand to his chest, bowed, and said, \"Welcome, the beautiful Miss Angel.\"\nYou're right, as expected of a member of the Psychology Alchemists. However, what you managed to observe was the me from a few months ago. It's all a facade I've put on for myself...Audrey opened her mouth in surprise and astonishment.\n\"Did you know me before, Mr. Hampres?\"\nShe didn't let her shocked expression linger too long on her face, because such emotions were meant to be instantaneous and wouldn't last too long.\nIf anyone were to be surprised for several seconds, then it meant that their performance was most likely an act.\nAudrey didn't notice this at first, but after watching others \"act\" all this time, she naturally came up with a lot of rules.\n\"No, I still don't know you. This is just the basics of being a psychology enthusiast.\" Hampres chuckled.\nBefore he could finish his sentence, Audrey had already completed her observations and made a corresponding judgment based on her surroundings.\nHis attire and the furnishings of his house all indicate that he's a person who cares deeply about how people view him...\nThe sapphire on the ring of his left hand doesn't look small, but its actual quality is very ordinary. There are no symbols or magic labels on it... His finances aren't as good as he presents them to be... He's vain...\nEven though he was very enthusiastic just now, the way he stands there, the direction in which his feet point, and the changes in his emotional colors all indicate that he still has many concerns and is on his guard...\nHe sincerely commended me on my looks, but it wasn't in the way a man would look at a woman. There are signs of him using facial products, and his eyebrows are definitely drawn. His skills are inferior to my make-up maidservant, Solia, but they're better than mine... The cologne he uses is \"Confusion,\" something that I've only seen women use before... Yes, he probably likes men, and the role he plays is the weaker one in the relationship...\nAt the same time, Audrey expressed her longing skillfully.\n\"I'd love to have your observational powers, Mr. Hampres.\"\nAs she spoke, she maintained a faint smile while being introduced to the other seven or eight people in the activity room under Hampres's and Escalante's lead.\nThe lovers of both mysticism and psychology were either descendants of fallen aristocrats, associate professors at universities, or the children of the rich. For example, the father of a young man was the owner of Philip's Department Store, the most famous department store in Backlund.\nIn the exchange that followed, Audrey basically only listened. The only time she spoke was by asking questions, fully expressing her curiosity and yearning.\nIn this \"academic\" discussion, Escalante and Hampres deliberately mentioned the Body of Heart and Mind, as well as the spirit world and the collective subconscious. They also shared some relatively unique points of view, allowing Audrey to gradually understand some of the questions she had accumulated all this time.\nWhen the discussion ended and they were out of the house, Audrey glanced at Escalante beside her and asked, with a little naivety, \"Ms. Escalante, when will I-I be as good in psychology as Mr. Hampres?\"\nEscalante curled the corners of her lips and slightly tilted her head as she looked at her.\n\"Very soon...\"\n...\nAt night, Klein, who was about to get into bed, once again appeared above the gray fog.\nDespite being a little sleepy, he was jolted awake by the news Miss Magician had reported.\nThe Aurora Order knows of The Fool? They know of my honorific name? The True Creator has locked onto me?Klein abruptly sat up straight, as though he was about to face an attack.\nHe quickly rejected the final theory. If the True Creator had indeed locked onto him, Mr. A would have long visited him on the pretext of collecting a copper penny for the gas meter. Perhaps, even a Saint might appear.\nThat is to say, only The Fool and his corresponding honorific name are known, and the clues point to Backlund... Who leaked the news?Klein frowned as he carefully thought about it.\nSoon, he discovered a possibility.\nLittle Sun has recently chanted my honorific name, and it happened when he was interacting with a member of the exploratory team who was corrupted by the True Creator... He held a sacrificial ritual, and there were likely symbols corresponding to The Fool at the scene. The ancient palace above the gray fog appeared.... So, the True Creator sensed the existence of The Fool and confirmed that I was the one who had been sacrilegious, no-harassing, no that's not right either-spying on him...\nAlso, Little Sun used the All-Black Eye at that time, which contains the mental corruption of the True Creator... Through that, \"He\" has confirmed that my adorers and believers are in Backlund?\nI can't take the All-Black Eye out in the future!\nHaving roughly understood the problem, Klein was left with another problem.\nMr. A announced the bounty for Mr. Fool's believers at a not-so-private, relatively open Beyonder gathering. Is he just dumb, or is he deliberately \"fishing?\"\nSigh, the Aurora Order members are all bigoted lunatics. Their brains are mostly damaged, so it's impossible to deduce their real intentions!\nThis is as the saying goes, as long as I'm crazy, you won't be able to guess what I'm thinking?","29":"Seeing that there weren't any abnormalities in the town of marionettes, Klein began thinking about Miss Justice's encounter.\nIt wasn't Adam who set up an attack against Ariehogg, but Hermes who masterminded it?\nOtherwise, it wouldn't be possible for Adam to not descend. It would also be impossible for Ariehogg to escape so easily. \"He\" had to rely on the second City of Miracles to have some hope of doing so.\nIf Hermes was the mastermind, the development of this whole episode becomes logical... Hermes never thought of capturing or killing Ariehogg. \"He\" only hopes to learn some information from this ancient mind dragon. When Ariehogg said \"Adam isn't necessarily Adam,\" the operation came to a natural end.\nYes, from the looks of it, Hermes already had some doubts about Adam's true state. However, due to the limitations of \"His\" status, \"He\" has been unable to make Ariehogg appear on \"His\" own accord, so \"He\" used Miss Justice.\nAdam isn't necessarily Adam; Ariehogg isn't necessarily Ariehogg... This sentence is very interesting. The upper echelons of the Spectator pathway are more mysterious than Seers. Back then, Dragon of Imagination Ankewelt clearly occupied Sequence 0, but \"He\" had a Sequence 1 son of the same pathway as \"Him\"-Dragon of Nightmare, Alzuhod...\nIf Adam really isn't Adam, then who is \"He\"? Is it that Adam from the myth in the time before the First Epoch, or part of the Primordial One? Or is \"He\" related to the resurrection of the ancient sun god? From the looks of it, the meaning behind why Medici addresses \"Him\" as a zealot has a far more profound meaning...\nKlein quickly conjured a gold coin and flicked it into the air, making a divination.\nThe results of the divination indicated that today's development was nothing dangerous.\nKlein immediately dispersed the gold coin and prepared to descend his consciousness into his body beneath Saint Arianna Cathedral.\nAt this moment, his actions became slightly sluggish.\nThe moment Miss Justice met Ariehogg and Hermes was almost simultaneous as the moment the MI9 personnel returned to Utopia to testify in court.\nJust looking at them individually, there was no problem; but the word \"simultaneous\" made Klein somewhat alert.\nHe was very sensitive to words like \"happened to,\" \"coincidence,\" \"simultaneous,\" and \"almost the same.\" This was a mark left behind by his past experiences.\nHe tapped his finger on the edge of the long mottled table and decided to make preparations for his worries.\nHe quickly condensed a light that contained certain words and some kind of will, and he threw it into a prayer light.\nAfter doing this, Klein made his consciousness sink and left Sefirah Castle, allowing his mind to return to his original body.\nImmediately after, he began to influence Utopia. He planned to use all sorts of arrangements to temporarily make all the foreigners \"leave.\"\nThis way, even if anything happened, it wouldn't affect the innocent.\nThis also meant that Klein was prepared to abandon Utopia and change locations to rebuild his marionette town. After all, a ritual could be repeated many times, but he could only afford one resurrection.\n...\n\"Have a good rest for the next two days. There's still some time left before court begins.\" Biles sent Wendel to the entrance of the Irises Hotel.\nWendel replied with a smile, \"I'm already feeling sleepy.\"\nIt was in the middle of the night. He had trouble sleeping previously because of his anxiety and nervousness. That was why he thought of walking around the headquarters of MI9 to ease his mood. However, when he heard the conversation between his colleagues at night, it triggered an eruption in his emotions, and he decided to return to Utopia and face the problem.\nAfter checking in, Wendel took his luggage and went to the third floor.\nWhen he passed through the door, he vaguely felt that his surroundings were abnormally dark.\nIn order to sleep better, Wendel walked to the window and drew the curtains.\nDuring this process, he felt that the scenery outside the window was unusually familiar.\nHowever, under the cover of the night, he couldn't tell what was happening too clearly. Thinking that it might have been the scene he had seen in Utopia previously, he covered his mouth with his hand and yawned. He took off his clothes and walked towards the bed.\n...\nMonica slept until midnight when she suddenly needed to pee.\nUnable to hold it in any longer, she eventually got out of bed and walked towards her room's attached bathroom.\nWhen she pushed the bathroom door open, she found it a little heavier.\nRubbing her eyes that were almost unable to open, Monica didn't care about this small change. She quickly relieved herself and ran out of the bathroom to her bed.\nWhen she entered the covers, she felt that the temperature was much lower and she had no choice but to wrap herself up tightly in layers.\nIt didn't take long for her to fall asleep again.\n...\nAbout 15 minutes later, the patrolling Biles rubbed his hands and turned towards the street where the police station was. He was about to hand over duties with his colleagues.\nSuddenly, his body froze in the alley.\nThe black and dense Spirit Body Threads on his body peeled off at the same time as they floated upwards.\nA pruned and exquisite paper figurine landed and connected to the Spirit Body Threads, quickly turning into another Biles.\nAt the same time, a torrent of mixed knowledge surged over and reassembled him into a man wearing gorgeous clothes with long chestnut hair.\nThe man had blue eyes, a high nose bridge, and thin lips. It was Roselle Gustav's Sequence 1 historical projection.\nRight on the heels of that, the projection reached out and sucked all the information in the surroundings into its palm, forming an illusory ball of light.\nThis information included all the details that involved Biles.\nIn the next second, Roselle Gustav's historical projection forged a piece of information that was completely normal, allowing it to follow the Spirit Body Threads connected to the paper figurine to the Saint Arianna Cathedral in the municipal square, moving straight underground of the cathedral.\nAfter this series of actions, another torrent of information surged in midair. With Roselle's help, they reformed into three figures.\nA middle-aged man wearing a black robe and a hood with a long, thick, white beard; another, who was draped in a cloak, had black hair, blue eyes, and a rather squarish face. He was a middle-aged man with a dignified bearing; on one of the trees, there was a huge tree that seemed to be drenched with petroleum. On the tree, there were arms with all sorts of strange protruding objects that rolled with bloodshot eyes.\n\"They\" were:\nThe leader of the Secret Order, Zaratul!\nLoen's Protector, the first King, William Augustus I's historical projection!\nA historical projection of Abomination Suah!\nAfter making the necessary preparations, Zaratul used the location provided by the historical projection to sneak into Utopia.\n\"He\" didn't waste any time. \"He\" reached out with \"His\" right hand and used the law of convergence of Beyonder characteristics to suck out the Worm of Spirit in Biles.\nElsewhere, the palm of Abomination Suah's historical projection made an ugly doll the size of a palm appear.\nThe doll was wet and sticky. It had no eyes, ears, or nose. It only had a pinhole-like mouth that emitted and sucked grayish-white fog.\nAs the Worm of Spirit and the doll approached, the black-and-white eyeballs that rolled out on the Suah tree trunk looked at them at the same time.\nSilently, the Worm of Spirit fused with the ugly doll, causing it to distort as it squirmed, growing out eyes, nose, and ears, making it look like Klein Moretti.\nAt this point, Zaratul no longer did any concealment, nor could \"He\" do so. \"He\" took out a black shroud and abruptly wrapped Klein's doll up!\nAll the marionette's Spirit Body Threads in Utopia were severed at the same time-they were unable to connect to the true body.\nThis wasn't because there was something wrong with them, but that the true body was isolated from them.\nAll of a sudden, the duty personnel in the police station, tenants in the hotel, Tracey and the thieves in the cell, Anderson in another apartment, Alzu, and the other citizens all stopped breathing and turned stiff.\nRegardless of whether they were sleeping or doing something else, it was as if a pause button had been pressed.\nKlein, who was at the bottom of Saint Arianna Cathedral, suddenly woke up. He knew that an accident had happened.\nHe didn't hesitate. With a thought, he returned to Sefirah Castle. With the level and strength of a King of Angels, he was able to resist enemies that had shown or had yet to show themselves.\nThis was the best choice in the current situation.\nEven if he wasn't able to protect his true body, Klein still had a chance to revive.\nAt that moment, his floating consciousness touched an invisible, dark barrier, making it difficult to penetrate it and enter Sefirah Castle.\nThis... Klein's heart tightened, believing that the enemy might be more troublesome than he had imagined.\nFew high-level existences knew he could return to Sefirah Castle with a thought!\nIn the next second, the thick, petroleum-slathered tree had arrived above Saint Arianna Cathedral.\nIn addition, a deep and dignified voice resounded:\n\"Wandering is prohibited here!\n\"Teleportation is prohibited here!\n\"...\"\nKlein wasn't led by his emotions. Seeing that he couldn't return to Sefirah Castle at the moment, he immediately changed his strategy and leaped towards the fog of history.\nThe moment the grayish-white fog entered his eyes, it turned into a whirlpool formed by countless transparent maggots. The vortex extended out slippery tentacles covered with strange patterns.\nUnlike previously, the vortex emitted a powerful suction force, causing Klein's figure to speed up and be entangled by countless tentacles.\nLaw of Beyonder characteristics convergence!\nThe law of Beyonder characteristic convergence between angels!\nA subtle beam of light flashed as Klein, who was firmly controlled by Zaratul's Mythical Creature form, turned into a paper figurine.\nThis was an angel-level application of Paper Figurine Substitutes, as well as the help of \"Grafting.\"\nAlthough Klein couldn't return to Sefirah Castle, he could influence the Worms of Spirit above the gray fog, allowing them to use the \"curtain\" to provide help.\nAfter dodging Zaratul's fatal blow, Klein ran into the fog of history and fled towards the former metropolis from a time before the First Epoch.\nAt this moment, many marionettes, who had been dead for a long time in Utopia, rapidly decayed from losing the Spirit Body Threads maintaining them. Their limbs dropped to the ground or mutated because of their Beyonder characteristics. The latter transformed into different monsters, ones far more terrifying than imaginable.\nSome swallowed their heads; others were left with only squirming flesh, while others grew dense eyes...\nSoon, Klein ran into the old metropolis situated inside the fog of history.\nTo him, this was a safe room that could be trusted. This was because only a Scholar of Yore who was a human from before history could enter.\nWithout any hesitation, Klein habitually surveyed the area and began praying to the Evernight Goddess in the stacked city.\nOof!\nA faint sound rang out as an ancient wooden stake with traces of blood penetrated Klein's heart from behind.\nA figure phased into existence behind him. It was a cold-looking man wearing a half top hat and a black trench coat:\nGehrman Sparrow.\nKlein's pupils dilated as the crazy adventurer said in a deep voice, \"Adam has given me humanity.\""},"summary_target":{"0":"Boom! Silver lightning bolts strike the translucent black velvet \"curtain,\" allowing Reinette Tinekerr to return to Klein's pocket and the gold coin. Klein raises the Staff of the Stars, unleashing a Druid's power, causing the ground to turn into a marsh. The curtain, no longer restricted, collapses under the lightning storm, and the ancient castle is left in ruins. As the lightning subsides, Dark Demonic Wolf Kotar's castle lies in shambles, with red flames burning in many spots. Kotar and Klein emerge from underground, ready for another intense battle. Kotar uses the crinkled curtain to prevent Reinette's possession, while she transforms into a massive werewolf, engaging in a fierce battle with the demonic wolf. Meanwhile, Klein faces off against Kotar's three remaining marionettes, including a giant brown bear that he attacks with the Staff of the Stars, causing random abnormal changes. As the battle rages on, Klein dodges and weaves, using his cunning and the staff's powers to take down the marionettes, but the fight is far from over. ","1":"As Klein sits in the mysterious space above the gray fog, a blazing sun-like flame erupts, and a hurricane ravages the ancient palace. However, the destruction is short-lived, and the palace restores itself to its original state. Klein's brain is affected, with charred maggots crawling out of his head before returning to normal. He realizes that the being responsible is stronger than Dragon of Imagination Ankewelt. Klein recalls two scenes: one where the ancient sun god, likely the City of Silver Creator, wears a crucifix and speaks a language that stirs the powers of nature. The second scene shows the deity being eaten by the Kings of Angels, White, Wisdom, and Wind. Klein theorizes that the Unshadowed Crucifix was obtained by one of the Kings of Angels or Amon and Adam, and its effects make it an important item. He wonders if Adam arranged for the cross to be found and why it was given to Miss Magician and Miss Judgment. Klein's thoughts are filled with questions about the City of Silver Creator's high level and abilities, as well as the meaning of \"Mysteries.\" He decides to record the knowledge he gained about the Sequence 4: Unshadowed recipe and other Beyonder characteristics, all while fearing Adam's power and planning to have the Unshadowed Crucifix reformed into a pure Beyonder characteristic.","2":"Klein, still going by the alias Gehrman Sparrow, arrives in Nas, a city in the Gargas Archipelago, and is immediately struck by the pungent smell of canned wolf-fish. As he explores the city, he witnesses a protest against beluga whale poaching, which quickly turns violent. The protesters, demanding sustainable development, clash with the police, and the scene becomes chaotic. Klein, unfazed by the commotion, searches for an inn to stay and begins exploring the local cuisine, sampling various whale-based dishes. As he navigates the city, Klein reflects on the likelihood of encountering Faceless, Beyonders from the Seer pathway, and rationalizes that it's unlikely he'll meet many in Nas. He continues his carefree exploration, enjoying the local delicacies and taking in the sights and sounds of the city. With a harmonica in hand, a tool gifted by the Artisan that can summon a spirit world creature, Klein walks the streets of Nas, blending in with the locals. Klein's journey in Nas continues as he visits a sundry store named Hot Whale Dance, where he meets a grizzled boss and inquires about whale oil. His adventure in this peculiar city is only just beginning, and with his sharp wit and cunning, he'll navigate the complexities of Nas and uncover its secrets.","3":"Klein, still in disguise, visits the Ceres' manor, where he learns about Hazel's predicament after being bitten by her rat teacher, which has turned rabid. He suspects the rat is a Marauder demigod and leaves, wishing Hazel a blessing from the Goddess. Unbeknownst to Klein, Hazel is struggling with her own identity and the source of her strength, feeling lost and vulnerable after the incident. In her dark moment, Hazel experiences a hallucination or nightmare, where she sees her teacher and other gray rats with dark red eyes. However, she soon realizes it was an illusion created by someone with extraordinary powers, leaving her terrified and shaken. As she uncovers the truth, Hazel starts to piece together the motives behind the illusion, suspecting that the person was searching for her teacher. With her usual arrogance and confidence shattered, Hazel is forced to confront the limitations of her abilities and the unknown dangers that lurk in the shadows. As she attempts to regain her composure, she begins to formulate a theory about the true intentions of the mysterious person, setting the stage for a thrilling and unpredictable adventure.","4":"Duke Negan's pleasure is abruptly interrupted as his mind buzzes with an uncontrollable explosion of sensations, leaving him shaken and vulnerable. His Wind-blessed guard and secretary sense a mysterious, spiritual smell, leading the secretary to investigate the attic where he confronts the Desire Apostle. The devilish entity, covered in a thick black liquid, unleashes fireballs and chaotic energy, but the refined secretary manages to deflect the attacks using his unique abilities. As the battle rages on, the secretary's body begins to take on rusted red marks, and he coughs up blobs of congealed blood. The Desire Apostle, too, begins to cough up rusted blood, revealing that the Language of Foulness has partially backfired on him. Meanwhile, the Wind-blessed attends to Duke Negan, removing any potential threats and helping him recover from his weakened state. With his secretary struggling against the Desire Apostle, Duke Negan uses his conch necklace to call for aid, blowing into it and summoning the Holy Wind Cathedral's power. The tide rushes in, signaling the start of a new and intense confrontation.","5":"Emlyn White stands stiff, his mind blank, as he's confronted by Klein, who asks why he prayed to him. Emlyn recounts a revelation from his Ancestor, claiming he's key to preparing for the apocalypse, and Klein is taken aback by the detailed response. As Klein processes the information, he connects the dots, suspecting that either Lilith, the ancient goddess, is still alive or another deity is impersonating her, using the Sanguine as pawns in their game. Klein remains calm, inquiring about Emlyn's mission, and the Sanguine admits he doesn't know. The Fool's nonchalant attitude calms Emlyn, who realizes he's been pulled into a magical realm by a hidden existence. Emlyn, buoyed by his Ancestor's recognition, claims he'll be the key to saving the Sanguine from the apocalypse, which begins with praying to The Fool. Klein, amused by Emlyn's \"eighth-grader syndrome,\" ponders the true intentions behind the revelation. He proposes that Emlyn's Ancestor wants him to grow into a high-level entity with Klein's help, saving the Sanguine in the process. Emlyn is puzzled, citing the Sanguine's inability to grow without ceremonies and relics. Klein cryptically suggests there may be other ways, offering Emlyn an opportunity to discover the truth, which the Sanguine eagerly accepts.","6":"Klein meticulously prepares the ritual materials, pouring the Classical Metallurgist's potion formula and the blood of a Dawn Paladin and Derrick Berg into a ceramic jar wrapped in paper figurines. He stirs the mixture, then seals it with the Paper Angel, ensuring the removal of connections between the blood and its providers. Klein reflects on his outstanding gatherings, only missing Prisoner, Devil, and Demoness, and plans to visit Miss Sharron in person to request the remaining Beyonder blood. As he waits, Klein takes out a pen and paper, drawing a symbol to summon Arrodes, asking about Sefirah Castle. The magic mirror ripples with aqueous light, and Arrodes appears, expressing anxiety and panic. Klein comfortingly responds, and Arrodes shares rumors about Sefirah Castle, believed to be a \"kingdom\" formed from part of the Creator's body or something created by them. Arrodes reveals eight entities similar to Sefirah Castle, including the Chaos Sea, and shares rumors from ancient gods about the River of Eternal Darkness and the Brood Hive. Klein silently repeats the key information, sensing a connection but unable to piece together the clues. He then inquires about Dark Angel Sasrir's origins, and Arrodes begins to respond, leaving Klein with more questions and mysteries to unravel.","7":"Audrey, now residing in a villa, hurries to pay off her debts to Mr. Fool's Blessed and Mr. World, totaling 3,800 pounds. Meanwhile, she secretly concocts a potion in a laboratory, using a Psychiatrist characteristic and ingredients. Susie, her golden retriever, is the intended recipient of the potion, which Audrey hopes will enhance her abilities. As Audrey completes the potion, Susie's behavior becomes increasingly unusual, with her pupils turning vertical and dark gold scales emerging beneath her fur. Audrey watches anxiously, prepared to use the Psychoanalysis power to stabilize Susie if needed. In a separate scene, Daisy returns to her childhood home in a dream, where she encounters a mysterious police officer who questions her about the Capim case. Daisy shares seemingly trivial details, including her mother and sister's hiring of private detective Sherlock Moriarty to search for her. The officer listens intently, his warm smile hinting at a deeper interest in Daisy's story.","8":"As Klein converses with Sharron, he inquires about various high-sequence Beyonders and events, showcasing his connection to the mysterious world. He asks about a Prisoner pathway Beyonder who can control lifeless objects, and Sharron reveals the name \"Puppet\" and its demigod, Shanks. Klein also mentions Zatwen, and Sharron confirms his involvement with the Naturism Sect's leader. Klein's inquiries lead to discussions about the Rose School of Thought, a secret organization with a thousand-year history. Sharron shares her knowledge, revealing that they have around five saints, two to three angels, and Grade 0 Sealed Artifacts. Klein's questions eventually transition to his recent near-death experience, where he encountered the Mother Tree of Desire and the Rose School of Thought's ambush. Sharron's rare emotional reaction hints at her connection to the topic. Sharroninform Klein about the destruction of Williams Street by the Nighthawks and Machinery Hivemind two months prior. Klein ponders the circumstances, suspecting a connection to Baronet Pound's demise. He asks about the current situation, and Sharron describes the area's high-rise buildings and lack of surveillance. Klein proposes exploring the site together, mindful of their unwritten agreement. ","9":"Klein, still operating under the persona of Gehrman Sparrow, strategically ponders the advantages and disadvantages of being a \"weak\" target for the Dark Demonic Wolf. He concludes that his vulnerability could be leveraged to bait the angel, but the initiative would be in the Dark Demonic Wolf's hands, leaving Klein exposed to potential attacks. Moreover, Klein regrets not being an angel from the Spectator pathway, which would allow him to turn the tables on the Dark Demonic Wolf. Klein's thoughts are filled with the complexities of the situation, and he realizes that he needs the help of other experienced beings to devise a plan. He decides to seek advice from Miss Messenger, Will Auceptin, and Arianna in Backlund, hoping to gain new insights. Meanwhile, Leonard and Cattleya will consult with Pallez Zoroast and Queen Mystic Bernadette. As the Tarot Club members disperse, Leonard confers with Pallez Zoroast, seeking guidance on Klein's predicament. Pallez Zoroast suggests that the only viable solution is to seek help from The Fool, a powerful entity that even Amon cannot capture. ","10":"As Klein delves deeper into his psychological treatment with Audrey, he extracts memories related to The Fool and grafts them above the gray fog. On his mind island, Audrey appears with a light white silk scarf covering her eyes and begins to awaken Gehrman Sparrow's memories related to his humanity. She recalls her own experiences and emotions, emitting corresponding fluctuations that manifest as firefly-like light points on the surface of Klein's mind island, representing cherished scenes from his past. Each point of light presents a different scene, showcasing Klein's human experiences, from childhood to adulthood. As Audrey's spiritual intuition guides her, she senses a strong sense of danger, as if a corrupting influence is about to overwhelm her. To counter this, she performs a Psychoanalysis and \"Placates\" the corruption, diluting the darkness around a mysterious door of light. After an unknown amount of time, Audrey finally achieves the initial results she expects, and the treatment comes to an end. As she leaves Klein's mind island, he wipes his face, and The Fool's memories return to his true body. Audrey removes her white silk scarf, muttering poignantly about the terrifying mental problems brought by godhood, to which Klein nods in understanding, revealing that angels, saints, and even some Beyonders suffer from this affliction.","11":"Klein, sporting a stubble and gold-rimmed glasses, enters a luxurious living room in West Borough, accompanied by Rogo Colloman. The atmosphere is warm, with lit fireplaces and golden decorations. They're greeted by Adol, a 15-year-old boy, who sits shivering and hugging himself, wrapped in a thick fur coat. Adol's dark blue hair has lost its luster, and his aura is tainted with a deep blackish-green sheen, indicating possession by wraiths. Klein discreetly examines him, detecting the telltale signs of haunting. As Klein surveys the room, he meets the other guests, including Detective Kaslana and her assistant Lydia, both armed with revolvers, and Stuart, who sits opposite them. Klein exchanges pleasantries, removing his coat and hat, and later impresses them with his imitation of a gunshot sound using his cane, catching them off guard. The tension is momentarily broken, but the air remains thick with anticipation. With Adol's condition and the presence of various detectives, the chapter sets the stage for a thrilling mystery to unfold. Klein's cunning and unique abilities have already made an impact, and as the story progresses, the stakes will likely escalate, putting his skills to the test.","12":"Klein delves deeper into the history of the Fourth Epoch, courtesy of Mr. Door's revelations. He learns about the infamous War of the Four Emperors, where the Dark Emperor, Blood Emperor, and Night Emperor fell, and the Emperor of the Underworld, also known as Death, emerged victorious. However, Death's newfound power came at the cost of madness, and he eventually teamed up with the Primordial Demoness to bring about the Pale Disaster. As Klein digests this information, he begins to form connections between the deities and their roles in the war. He wonders if Death had already become a true deity during the War of the Four Emperors and ponders the terrifying consequences of a mad deity. Mr. Door's mention of the Laws of Beyonder Characteristics Indestructibility and Similar Sequence Beyonder Characteristics Conservation sparks Klein's curiosity, leading him to speculate about the nature of Beyonders and the existence of an omnipotent creator. Klein's thoughts are filled with a mix of awe and trepidation as he considers the implications of Mr. Door's words. He raises his evaluation of the Dark Emperor, Blood Emperor, and Night Emperor, believing them to be pre-eminent mighty figures close to being deities. The darkness of the future weighs heavily on Klein's mind, and he can't help but wonder if the end of days is inevitable.","13":"Klein visits the Divination Club, dressed in his new combat attire, seeking answers about Hanass Vincent's death. He shows Angelica, the beautiful attendant, a portrait of the mysterious man from his dream, and she recognizes the man from a month ago, describing him as having grayish-blue eyes and messy eyebrows. Klein learns that the man had a rare conversation with Hanass Vincent, sparking his curiosity about their connection. As Klein converses with Angelica, he realizes that his Spirit Vision has become clearer, allowing him to faintly see the details within her aura. He attributes this sudden improvement to his Seer potion, which seems to be digesting with promising signs. Klein reflects on his past experiences and narrows down the essence of the \u2018acting' technique, understanding that maintaining respect and fear towards fate is crucial for a Seer. With newfound determination, Klein thanks the suited clown's lesson and bids farewell to Angelica, ready to embark on the next phase of his plan. The mysterious man's identity remains unknown, but Klein is undeterred, driven by his growing confidence in his abilities as a Seer.","14":"Danitz, still reeling from his captain's unexpected visit, decides to facilitate a conversation between Vice Admiral Iceberg Edwina Edwards and Gehrman Sparrow. As Edwina questions Klein, he's forced to feign nonchalance, revealing his university education and mastery of various languages, much to Danitz's surprise. Edwina's unflappable demeanor and patient attitude evoke a sense of familiarity in Klein, who's reminded of his own past life. Edwina thoughtfully responds to Klein's questions, providing detailed information about Beyonder creatures at sea, specifically the Naga tribe's quest for an underwater city. However, she disappoints Klein by not mentioning mermaids. Her cryptic explanation of the law of convergence of Beyonder characteristics leaves Klein pondering the possibilities, and her hypothetical solution to removing mental corruption only serves to emphasize the insurmountable challenge. As the conversation continues, Klein's thoughts wander to Edwina's impressive knowledge of mysticism, rivaling his own, and her alleged ability to replicate Beyonder powers. He's forced to rein in his curiosity, nodding thoughtfully as he ponders the implications of their exchange. The air remains thick with tension, and the stakes continue to escalate as the mysterious forces of Symeem Harbor loom in the shadows.","15":"Klein, exhausted from the intense battle, takes a break from reading the Book of Secrets and decides to store all the mystical items and Beyonder characteristics above the gray fog, choosing to wait for the commotion to subside before deciding what to take out. He's aware of his current weakness, with his spirituality drained and his Beyonder powers growing faster than his spiritual strength. After washing up, Klein uses Cogitation to get rid of his tiredness and falls asleep, entering a dreamlike state where he sees fragmented scenes. In the Machinery Hivemind, Deacon Ikanser Bernard is investigating the incident, using a silver mirror with ancient patterns to scry for answers. Despite the rats in the sewers tampering with divination, Ikanser manages to get a glimpse of the participants involved, seeing a figure in a black double-breasted frock coat, a middle-aged man in a dark red cloak, a woman with messy blonde hair, and two men with black fur being pulled by strange arms. As the mirror reveals more scenes, it becomes clear that the investigation is far from over, and the mysterious Beyonder world holds many secrets. The chapter ends with Ikanser's expression turning abnormally serious, hinting at the consequences of lying or giving a wrong answer to the mirror's questions.","16":"As Amon's phantom approaches Sefirah Castle, a gigantic bluish-black palm suddenly appears, blocking his path. The palm belongs to Bladel, the God of Glory, who has been dead for thousands of years. Despite being cursed, Bladel's body now sports illusory black tubes behind his back, which seem to extend into infinity. With a mighty swing of his broadsword, Bladel unleashes an unimaginable power, creating a storm that destroys the desolate moor. Meanwhile, Klein takes advantage of Amon's momentary distraction to regain his clarity of mind. He establishes a new connection with the dark red figure at The Fool's seat, and then resonates with it to return to Sefirah Castle. However, Amon's phantom remains obstructed by Bladel's palm. The monocled King of Angels utters a name \u2013 \"Evernight\" \u2013 hinting at the help coming from the Evernight Goddess. Klein has been anticipating this moment, recalling his research on the former Chief of the City of Silver, who had attempted to switch to Sequence 3 Ferryman of the Death pathway but ended up turning into a monster. This anomaly is related to the illusory black tubes, which are also connected to Artificial Death. Klein suspects that the Evernight Goddess can exert a low level of influence on certain things in the Forsaken Land of the Gods, which might just be the key to unlocking the secrets of this enigmatic world.","17":"Klein welcomes Detective Stuart into his residence, where they engage in a casual conversation about the cold weather, winter vacations, and fishing. As they chat, Stuart hands Klein thirty pounds as agreed upon, and Klein can't help but think that the reward is rather low for a vampire. The conversation flows smoothly, with Klein skillfully deflecting Stuart's questions about his past and detective experience. As Stuart departs, Klein reflects on the unexpected turn of events and the widening of his social connections in the detective circles. He spends the rest of the afternoon reading the Book of Secrets, realizing how much he still has to learn about mysticism. As evening approaches, Klein prepares a delicious beef bone radish soup and is interrupted by the doorbell, signaling the arrival of Emlyn White, the handsome vampire he encountered earlier. Emlyn's impatience is palpable as Klein greets him, and the air is thick with anticipation. Klein's knowing smile hints that he is aware of Emlyn's recent visit to the Harvest Church, where the effects of the Mental Terror Candle can be resolved. The stage is set for a thrilling encounter between these two enigmatic characters, and the outcome hangs precariously in the balance.","18":"Klein's mind is reeling as he processes the information about the subsidiary gods, including the Dragon of Wisdom, God of the Dead, and God of Dawn, and wonders if they managed to survive the authority retrieval operation at the end of the Second Epoch. Meanwhile, Audrey, acting as different female elves, engages in conversations with Siatas, delving into the history of the elves, including the unknown beginning years, the \"Sprouting Era,\" and the \"Early Era of Fire\" when ancient gods fought each other. As Siatas shares her experiences and knowledge, Klein learns about the existence of the East Continent, a place believed to be the Forsaken Land of the Gods, and the elves' traditions, including their language, customs, and idolization of the strong. Audrey's influence causes Siatas's dream to shift, reflecting the elf's subconscious memories and curiosity about the Western Continent, which Queen of Calamity Cohinem intriguingly suggests may or may not exist. Klein's analysis continues as Siatas's dream reveals more about the coral palace, Cohinem's enigmatic responses, and the elf's gradual emotional descent into melancholy, influencing Audrey and the others to ponder the mysteries of the ancient gods and the true nature of the Western Continent.","19":"Klein decides to use the dim quill 0-08 to write a warning to himself about George III's impending ritual, revealing that the king plans to use the ceremony to bait out his enemies before attempting to becomea god. However, using 0-08's power exhausts Klein, making him dizzy and forcing him to rely on his own spirituality to recover. He realizes that he can only maintain the connection for about a minute, which is much too short, and that he needs to be more cautious when using Groselle's Travels to summon 0-08 in the future. As Klein ponders his next move, he remembers his promise to buy ice cream for Will Auceptin and decides to leave his house despite the danger of running into Amon in Backlund. Meanwhile, Melissa and her brother Benson prepare to head out into the gray and misty morning, dressed in old-fashioned attire that sparks a conversation about the rising price of bread. With George III's ritual looming and unknown dangers lurking in the shadows, Klein must tread carefully to avoid detection by the Psychology Alchemists and Amon's brother. As he navigates the complex web of powers and alliances, Klein's cautious nature is put to the test, and his resolve to uncover the truth is solidified.","20":"Klein anxiously opens the second level of the Box of the Great Old Ones, unaware of the destination it will choose. The interior transforms into a miniature cosmos, and the scene rapidly changes, finally revealing a vast desert landscape. Klein, Reinette Tinekerr, Abomination Suah, and the Rose School of Thought followers are transported to this new environment, leaving the projection of the Chained God behind. As Klein tries to comprehend his surroundings, Abomination Suah's evil roar and auras bind him, restricting his movements. Reinette Tinekerr's curse, accumulated over a long time, is unleashed, but Abomination Suah withstands it. Klein uses Creeping Hunger to escape and flashes to another side, avoiding the Blood Moon Arrow. In this chaotic situation, Klein uses his Blinking ability to teleport and repeatedly reach out to the void, eventually dragging out Arianna, the leader of the Church of Evernight's ascetics. With her help, Reinette Tinekerr gains an advantage against Abomination Suah. Meanwhile, the Rose School of Thought's Shaman King attempts to restrict Klein's movements, but his unpredictability allows him to evade attacks.","21":"As Klein masters the control of Senor's marionette, he discovers the challenges of hiding its abnormalities from other Marionettists and the risks of using it as a shield. To mitigate these risks, Klein plans to \"cleanse\" the Wraith in the gray fog and seal it with a 3-layered interference effect, making it difficult for the Rose School of Thought to track him. He also reflects on the Mother Tree of Desire's control over its organization members, realizing that as long as he doesn't attempt to divine its secrets, he can use the marionette without triggering any problems. Klein uses Azik's copper whistle to test the marionette, and after confirming its authenticity, he surveys the area and picks up the silver necklace. He takes four steps counterclockwise, chanting an incantation, and returns to the real world. The copper whistle doesn't react abnormally, indicating no latent problems with the marionette. Klein then uses the marionette to rummage through Senor's pockets, finding a substantial amount of cash and 13 gold coins. As Klein contemplates cashing out the marionette on the black market, he realizes the risks involved and decides to hold off. Instead, he divines the origins and usage of the silver necklace, discovering it came from a Sequence 5 Winner from the Life School of Thought. With this new information, Klein is one step closer to unraveling the mysteries of the mysterious world he's entangled in.","22":"Klein meets with Bernadette, aka Queen Mystic, in his cramped rental apartment in East Borough, where she reveals that she has failed to prevent a disaster in Backlund, despite her preparations. The disaster in question is the Great Smog, which Klein had witnessed in his visions of the past. Bernadette explains that advancing to Sequence 2, known as \"the Sage,\" requires preventing a higher-level disaster, which she had anticipated but ultimately failed to stop due to Feysac's sudden air raid. As Klein converses with Bernadette, he can't help but think about the machinations of the powerful and the devastating consequences of the war. He suspects that Amon's brother has been manipulating events from behind the scenes, including Azik's life in the Northern Continent, and that the current war is part of a larger plan. This realization sends Klein into a moment of post-traumatic stress disorder, but he quickly composes himself. Klein advises Bernadette that the current war presents an opportunity for her to advance to Sage, suggesting that she use her Grade 0 Sealed Artifact to stop certain disasters from happening at critical moments. Bernadette nods in agreement, acknowledging that she possesses at least one such artifact and is preparing for the ritual to advance to Sage. The meeting ends with Bernadette's gentle but emotionless voice taking on a slight change, hinting at the intricate web of power struggles and ancient machinations that will continue to unfold.","23":"Klein's thoughts are still reeling from the dark turn of events with Hood Eugen, but a new surprise awaits him \u2013 a mysterious messenger from Mr. Azik, a powerful Beyonder who has seemingly sent a warning about dealing with Beyonders. As Klein processes this unexpected development, he can't help but feel envious of Azik's abilities, especially after witnessing the messenger's unusual powers. He pockets the letter, containing a cryptic message about Azik's search for his past and encounters with former teachers and students, which seems to hint at a deeper connection between them. Back in his room, Klein finally unfolds the letter, revealing Azik's apologetic tone and cryptic messages about his past lives. Azik mentions encountering Beyonder powers, including Rear Admiral Hurricane Qilangos, a notorious figure wanted by multiple kingdoms. Klein's eyes widen as he realizes the implications of this information, and his mind starts racing with possibilities. Azik's familiarity with the Shepherd's abilities sparks an idea in Klein, who sees an opportunity to manipulate Azik into helping him. As Klein continues reading, he becomes increasingly convinced that Azik is a High-Sequence Beyonder with a deep understanding of various mystical powers. The warning about sacrificial rituals and evil gods resonates deeply with Klein, who is now more determined than ever to navigate this treacherous world of Beyonders. With this new information, Klein is left wondering what secrets Azik holds and what consequences this new connection might bring.","24":"Alger Wilson stands on an ancient sailboat, stunned by a report from The World, who has obtained the Ocean Songster potion formula and its main ingredient in mere days. Alger is bewildered, wondering how The World achieved this feat, recalling Gehrman Sparrow's enigmatic presence and speculating that he may have entered treacherous waters to seek The Hermit's help. Alger is torn between excitement and anxiety, realizing he needs to reciprocate The World's favor but lacks items or money of equal value. Meanwhile, Klein begins to scrutinize Groselle's Travels, the mysterious book he obtained. He performs a series of divinations, first determining that the book isn't the Spectator pathway's Uniqueness, then attempting to uncover its origins. Klein's divination transports him to a dark, hazy world, where he witnesses a breathtaking floating continent, complete with ancient palaces and majestic dragons of various colors. As Klein delves deeper into the book's secrets, he becomes increasingly entwined in the mysteries of Groselle's Travels, while Alger struggles to comprehend The World's incredible achievement and find a suitable way to show his gratitude.","25":"Klein sits down with Carlson, a Machinery Hivemind agent, at a Southville bar, where he's come prepared with a plan. He proposes that in exchange for sharing information about the Amon family's tomb, he'd like to choose an item from the spoils of the tomb exploration, preferably a mid-Sequence Beyonder ingredient. Klein's not looking to take any high-Sequence items and is willing to settle for a reasonable reward. Carlson is taken aback, not only by Klein's request but also by his unexpected display of faith, as he pulls out a Sacred Emblem and quotes the Steam and Machinery Bible to justify his actions. After Carlson leaves to report Klein's request, he returns with Ikanser Bernard, the deacon of the Machinery Hivemind. Ikanser agrees to Klein's request, but with one condition: items with strong side effects and curses are off-limits.  As Klein negotiates with Carlson and Ikanser, his cunning and adaptability shine through. He's determined to acquire the resources he needs to strengthen himself and further his goals, all while navigating the complex web of factions and interests in the world of Beyonders.","26":"Klein visits the Apothecary, Darkwill, who's concerned about being recognized by Klein, having used a fake name in Loen cities. Darkwillmutters to himself about needing to be cautious and leaving the city if he doesn't receive news about Old Man by March. The owl on his shoulder exposes his true thoughts, and Darkwill chuckles it off. Meanwhile, Danitz follows Klein, curious about the Apothecary's medicine. Klein purchases the ingredients for his medicine, which Danitz is skeptical about, but trusts the Apothecary's reputation. As Danitz brews the medicine, Klein reflects on his battle with Vice Admiral Ailment, realizing the powers of invisibility and ailments are like a game bug. He considers finding the chubby Apothecary's teacher, Old Man, using his own connections, including seeking help from Sea God believers and introducing himself to a military contact.  As Klein receives the brewed medicine, he hesitates for a moment before drinking it, finally taking a step towards recovering from his health issues. With his health at risk, Klein's curiosity about the Apothecary's abilities and the mysterious Old Man remains piqued, setting the stage for further discoveries in the City of Generosity.","27":"Klein unleashes a barrage of incomprehensible words, calming the hurricane-like suction force produced by the bronze door and revealing that Admiral Hell Ludwell's Beyonder power is the Language of the Dead, capable of targeting one's Spirit Body. As Ludwell freezes, his spirit is tugged at by an illusory power, but he quickly regains control and charges at Klein with his iron-black rapier. Klein, however, summons a handful of charms from the Sea God domain and uses them to counterattack, producing blue wind blades and heavy waves that inundate Ludwell. The battle rages on as Ludwell opens his mouth and produces a silent screech, temporarily freezing the wind blades, and then raises his left hand, causing the black, square-shaped ring on his index finger to glow with an eerie light. The bronze door swells in response, increasing its suction force to an unimaginable level. Klein attempts to clash with the door using Light of Holiness, but a white fireball interrupts his plan, and he's forced to improvise, using scarlet flames to escape and reposition himself. Just as Klein regains his footing, Anderson Hood arrives, floating awkwardly in mid-air with a burning-white spear in hand. Ludwell's reaction is one of surprise, and he responds by removing his silver mask, unleashing a heavy, pale-white light that lifts the bronze door off the deck and into the air. The door grows to over thirty meters tall, becoming an imposing entrance to another world, leaving Klein and Anderson to face this new, intensified threat. ","28":"At Mr. A's gathering, a mysterious blackboard sparks intrigue among the Beyonders, as it describes \"The Fool\" with phrases like \"doesn't belong to this era\" and \"the King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck.\" Mr. A warns against using Hermes or other languages to decipher the text, promising a handsome reward for finding believers in The Fool. Fors recognizes the honorific name as that of Mr. Fool, and her mind races with connections to the Tarot Club, Viscount Glaint, and a mysterious paper from the Viscount's study. Meanwhile, Fors and Xio simultaneously suspect Viscount Glaint's involvement, their suspicions piqued by the description on the blackboard. As they converse, Audrey attends an \"academic\" meeting at the elegantly decorated house of Mr. Stephen Hampres, a charming furniture merchant. With Susie by her side, Audrey is sized up by Hampres, who guesses her to be a cultured noble lady, excited and full of love. As the Beyonders continue their fervent discussion, Fors's thoughts whirl around her connection to The Fool, and she fears being discovered. Klein, meanwhile, remains focused on his divination, seeking answers about Will Auceptin and the dark forces at play. ","29":"Klein pieces together the puzzle, suspecting Hermes as the mastermind behind the attack on Ariehogg, with Adam being an unknowing pawn. The true intentions of Hermes remain unclear, but Klein senses that Adam's true nature is shrouded in mystery, potentially tied to the ancient sun god or the Primordial One. Medici's address of Adam as a zealot takes on a deeper meaning, and Klein's divination indicates no immediate danger, but his past experiences leave him wary of coincidences. As Wendel returns to Utopia, he's haunted by the darkness surrounding him, and Monica's sleep is disrupted by an unusual chill in the air. Meanwhile, Biles's patrol is interrupted by the sudden appearance of Roselle Gustav's Sequence 1 historical projection, which absorbs surrounding information and creates an illusory ball of light. The projection forges normal-seeming information and follows the Spirit Body Threads to the Saint Arianna Cathedral, where three figures materialize: a hooded man, a dignified middle-aged man, and a grotesque, tree-like creature adorned with bloodshot eyes. The air is thick with tension as the true extent of Hermes' plan and Adam's true nature remain unknown, leaving the characters \u2013 and the reader \u2013 on edge."}}
