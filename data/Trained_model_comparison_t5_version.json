Kotar, the Dark Demonic Wolf, raises his head, transforming into a terrifying giant bear that's twice the height of a person. Meanwhile, Klein, still hidden underground, evades the lightning bombardment, using his black staff to attack the brown bear's shoulder. The brown bear, now split into two, tries to give Klein a \"passionate\" hug that could crush all his bones and squeeze his chest muscles, but Klein doesn't retreat, fearing the physical attack would lead to abnormal changes or strange effects. With the God of Wishes's suppression, these changes and effects wouldn't exceed that of a Sequence 4 Beyonder power. As Klein fights the bear, Reinette appears on the translucent \"curtain,\" purging it from Klein's body and teleporting elsewhere. The curtain then reappears behind Klein, wrapping him in it, and a pure white and holy pillar of light descends from the sky, enveloping the black gas and the corresponding marionette. The staff lit up and the gems embedded in it lit up, igniting a holy light that envelopes the marionsette and their poison, melting the poison under the Sun's burning. Klein then finishes off the remainingMarionettes in just a few seconds, killing them all with his staff. The scene is reminiscent","31":"universally, Klein learns about the Unshadowed Crucifix, an important item \"Their\" father left behind. He learns that it was obtained by one of the three Kings of Angels, or it landed in Amon's or Adam's hands. The cross's effects are extremely useful, and its origins are a secret that needs to be kept. As Klein ponders the cross's origins, he realizes that it doesn't belong to Elvish, Dragonese, or ancient Hermes, but to the Augustus family, it's an important piece of information. He recalls the mysterious City of Silver Creator's ability to sense his history despite the long stretch of history between them. Klein writes down the knowledge he learned from looking straight at the City, and he stirs the powers of the mysterious space above the gray fog to suppress it. He doesn't wish to see the paper figurines he cut begin to praise the Sun the next time he comes. Meanwhile, in Cherwood Borough, a gray fog appears before a blurry figure, a postman riding a bike, and a pitch-black flame erupts out of the mailbox's mouth. The postman, Hvin Rambis, emerges, and the mystery unfolds, revealing that Hvin is a member of the upper echelons of a secret organization known as the Psychology Alchemists. Audrey, the Evernight Goddess, is shocked by the revelation, suspecting Hvin to be a cultist and a","32":" in Nas and the Gargas Archipelago, Klein explores the city of Gray Amber Street, passing by whaling houses and oil refineries. The smell of canned wolf-fish fills the air, and Klein realizes it's practically a biological weapon. As he navigates the streets, he observes the locals protesting against the government's policies, but most passersby seem unfazed. Klein's thoughts wander to the possibility of encountering Faceless beyond Sequence 8, which are rare in the Feysac Empire. He decides to stay at an inn, registering Gehrman Sparrow as a cause as a Church of the Goddess of Faceless. The harmonica that fixed the summoning ritual of a spirit world creature, matching Klein's inward intentions, could be used for a year and a half, allowing him to stay in the city for free. As Klein continues his exploration of the city, he encounters a mysterious man named Cattleya, who claims to be a member of the Tarot Club. Klein is shocked to discover that the man is actually the crazy hunter Gehrmen Sparrow, considered at the level of a pirate admiral. Klein begins to wonder about the true nature of the world he's stumbled into, and the implications of his actions and the consequences they could have on the world around him. With his thoughts still scattered, Klein sets out to unravel the mysteries of the Feiesac Empire, seeking answers through the mysterious world beyond the Seer pathway.","33":"inity: Marauder demigod, Marauder pathway, and Tussock. Klein suspects that the rat in the manor is likely the Marauders, but he's unsure why it went rabid and bit Hazel. As he ponders the possibilities, he recalls the incident at the ball, where a gray rat bit Hazel, causing her to enter a dream-like state. The gray rats crawl out from the corner of her bedroom, balcony, and bed, emitting squeaking sounds. She's in a similar state, her entire being turbid and muddled, her left hand wrapped in thick bandages, but there are no more signs of blood. Her expression is heavy, nothing like her usual arrogance, and she's afraid to inform her teacher, afraid of encountering danger and end up being sacrificed. Klein, meanwhile, has already noticed Hazel's actions thanks to his intuition, and he's not worried about her actions due to her item of higher level. He suspects that Hazel, who has an item of a higher level, could \"steal\" the flight abilities of birds and use that short period of time to cross the river, arriving within three hours. To go from North Borough's B\u00f6klund Street to Macht's manor in Backlund's northwestern suburbs would take three to five hours on carriage, but Klein suspects she could do it in less than an hour.

His body expands and grows a pair of huge bat wings that emit light blue tongues of flames, while the secretary's body is engulfed by a violent wind, sweeping him towards the wall. As the secretary tries to evade or dodge, he encounters objects that seem to have found lives of their own, avoiding him in ingenious ways. Meanwhile, the mysterious power that was \"sealed\" in here, had yet to be destroyed. The Desire Apostle, frustrated by the failure of his previous attempt, doesn't flustered by the fact that he couldn't control his desires. He spat out a word in the Devil, filled with foulness and filth, and says: \"Die at the same time! Die at the very same time!\" The room suddenly feels like it had been completely sealed, as if one can never leave the room unless effort is made.

As Emlyn ponders this revelation, he realizes that the Goddess who snatched the title of Lady of Crimson is already Sequence 0, corresponding to \"The Star\" in the Cards of Blasphemy. The Fool plays a key role in \"Her\" revelation, and Emlyn is intrigued by the prospect of cooperating with a yet-to-disappear ancient goddess. But how am I to cooperate with a goddess who knows secrets? Emlyn must divine whether or not to pull Emlyn into each gathering ahead of time, and Klein's revelation hints at a similar apocalyptic prophecy in the Sights in the Spirit World from Yellow Light Venithan. Klein also points out that the Abraham family's curse Emlyn White was pulled into a magical place by a hidden existence, and that the goddess is likely to report to you that you didn't get anyone afterward. The key to the apocalypse isn't you, but me! The Fool is not angry, Emlyn realizes. Is it because I represent the Ancestor? I am indeed special, and I wish to adhere to certain matters,\" Klein says, hinting at a deal.","36":"Klein drinks the Classical Metallurgist potion formula, seals a ceramic jar with Beyonder's blood, and uses Paper Angel to seal a full-body mirror with aqueous light to summon Arrode, his loyal servant. After completing the ritual, the pale golden words fade away, becoming silver once again. On the surface of the mirror, lines of words appear again: \"Eight,\" referring to the eight detailed records on the second Blasphemy Slate. Klein's thoughts wander to the River of Eternal Darkness, a pathway that may have produced a deity, but there's no clear evidence that this pathway has produced a true deity. As Klein ponders the possibilities, he asks Arrodes about Sefirah Castle and the origins of Dark Angel Sasrir, who may have come from the Chaos Sea. Arro Des answers that he doesn't know, but that he's loyal, lowly, and obedient servant. Klein then asks about Sasrir's current state, and ArroDes reveals that the ancient sun god was born from light and darkness, making Sasrir the Dark Angel. Klein begins to piece together the clues, but lacks the ability to piece apart the clues. He's left with a nagging feeling that he should be able to grasp something, but he lacks the knowledge to unravel the mysteries of Sasrir.

Audrey is taken aback, and Susie returns to being an ordinary dog as she slowly wags her tail. Meanwhile, Klein tours Oravi Island's port city with the mindset of a tourist, finding a brief and rare moment of relaxation in his tense life. He visits a bar named Sweet Lemon, where he consumes a juicy and sweet fruit. As he finishes his meal, he receives a dossier containing information about the red-eyed man from the Harvest church, Leonard Mitchell. Leonard's smile gradually freezes as his expression turns serious, and he repeats this name in his mind: Sherlock Moriarty. The Nighthawk shrugs and says, \"No, as long as you stop making me have nightmares.\" He then leaves the building and goes back to his office, leaving Klein to ponder the implications of his actions on the Harvest Church and the people of the port city. The dossier reveals that Leonard Mitchell is a vampire, currently under the jurisdiction of the Church of Earth, and that his parents had hired private detectives to find him.","38":"Klein and Sharron travel to the ruins of Williams Street, where Sharron reveals that Baronet Pound died during one of his revelries, ending Alista Tudor's final bloodline. As they explore the ruins, Klein learns that Williams Street has been destroyed by the Nighthawks and Machinery Hivemind. Sharron shares details about her encounter with Shanks, a demigod who claims to be the son of the Chained God, and the Rose School of Thought's leader, who attacked her outside Bayam. Klein asks about the Prisoner pathway Beyonder's power to attack lifeless items, which Sharron describes as \"Puppet\" and \"Abomination\" She also reveals that Shanks is an Abomination born 922 years ago, and that he's hiding the existence of Miss Messenger and Mr. Azik to avoid detection. Klein is stunned by Sharron's revelation, suspecting that she's aware of his existence and isn't affected by his abilities. As the group continues to explore, Klein wonders about Williams Street's future, and if Sharron has gone down to explore it. She declines to comment, and Klein wonders if Sherlock Moriarty is planning on heading down with her.

As he ponders, he realizes that he's not a Sequence 1 angel of the Spectator pathway, and learning of the cosmos would result in corruption from the cosmos, allowing him to be killed by \"His\" influence. However, the cosmos's nature is higher than that of an angel, and Klein is unsure how to manipulate it. He decides to seek advice from Miss Messenger, Will Auceptin, and the ascetic, Arianna, seeking advice from more experienced existences such as Pallez Zoroast and Queen Mystic Bernadette. As Klein ponders his options, he feels regretful for not being an angel. He makes the glove on his left hand become transparent, then \"Teleports\" away from Fors and Xio's rented apartment.

This is a method of awakening Gehrmen Sparrow's memoriesrelated to his humanity, a Beyonders manifestation of the effects of \"empathy\" The treatment is destined to fail right from the start, as Audrey's spiritual intuition gives her aStrong sense of Danger, although she can't see or hear anything. The firefly-like light dots floating above the island rapidly gather, weakening the corruption ahead of her. This makes Audrey sense the weakening of the danger, and she quickly \"placates\" the corruption, performing a true act of hypnosis. She then returns to her body, and Klein raises his hand to wipe his face, allowing The Fool's memories to return to his true body. As Klein stands up, he says to Audrey, \"If you give up on all your current identities in the mysticism world, and only be Mr. Fool's believer and Miss Audrey Hall from now on, you can avoid most of the risks of the former and drastically reduce the latter\" Audrey agrees, but asks, \"What if I","41":"Klein, dressed in a gold-rimmed top hat and black cane, follows Rogo Colloman into a spacious and bright living room, where he finds Adol, wrapped in a thick fur coat and blanket, shivering nonstop.

By the oriel window, a man in a black coat, bulging as if he were hiding a gun, looms large, and Klein wonders if it's one of the six bodyguards. As he sizes up the man, Klein's thoughts drift to Stuart, a young man with a full beard, and the mysterious figure in the mirror. Klein's curiosity piqued, he inquires about Mr. Moriarty, asking about the detective's mysterious past. As the conversation unfolds, a gunshot rings out, and Kaslana, Lydia, and Stuart rush to hide in their respective rooms, while Adol sits in the rocking chair, holding Azik's copper whistle, quietly watching his ward. With a loud bang, a flame rises from the ground, igniting an invisible figure, which struggles for a few moments before dissipating. With the flames extinguished, the figure is no longer visible to the public, leaving Klein and the others to ponder the implications of this mysterious encounter, and what lies ahead for them.","42":", Klein reads the Antigonus family's notebook, intrigued by Mr. Door's description of the War of the Four Emperors, which reveals that all three empires had existed at the time. As he reads the diary, Klein's interest in archeology and the history of the Fourth Epoch is piqued, and his curiosity about the mysterious Dark Emperor leads him to uncover contradictory findings. He believes that Death went mad, but he also became stronger, and teamed up with the Primordial Demoness to bring about a Pale Disaster for the Northern Continent. Meanwhile, the diary details Klein's plans to gain Beyonder powers combat powers that he can call his own, and he recalls the unique trait of the church's members, who are good at making and using items, but not very powerful Beyonder objects. The diary reveals that the Sauron family, an ancient family with a high possibility of having High-Sequence Beyonders, may have witnessed the war of the four Emperors. Klein's mind races, trying to piece together the contradictory findings from the content recorded in the notebook with his own mentor's viewpoint. He wonders what the real name of the pathetic fellow trapped in the deep darkness amidst the storms is, and what his Sequence is.

Angelica's emotions turn into a 'thinking blue', a normal reaction, and she reveals she has met Mr. Vincent before. Klein's Spirit Vision becomes clearer, and he realizes that his potion has begun to produce clear signs of digestion. As Angelica hands him a portrait of a man she had seen in a dream, Klein realizes that the man in the portrait is a policeman investigating Hanass's death. With this revelation, Klein begins to unravel the mysteries of Hanass and the mysterious Antigonus family. He uses his divination skills to narrow the essence of the 'acting' technique to 'actions corresponding to the name of the potion' Only by doing so can he change the state of his body, heart, and soul, making them closer to the remnant psyche in the potion, so as to gradually digest it. As Klein continues to digest his potion, he begins to realize that this is only a pit stop in the digestion process and not the final destination. In two or three months, or even two to three weeks time, he'll be ready to completely digest the potion. That sign is extremely obvious. It's no wonder the mysterious Mr. Zaratul said that the Beyonder will clearly sense it when the potion is fully digested. For him, he needs to figure out the identity of the man,","44":"ine, Klein meets with Vice Admiral Edwina Edwards, who reveals that Gehrman Sparrow is a university graduate. Danitz is stunned, unable to believe the crazy adventurer and bounty hunter had actually gone to university and even graduated. As they exchange pleasantries, Klein asks about her knowledge of Beyonder characteristics, and she reveals that she can replicate or simulate the Beyonder powers of her opponents when they use them in front of her. Klein then inquires about the Giant King's Court, and EdWina reveals that there are still giants active in the Fourth Epoch, with some switching faiths to the God of Combat. Klein is intrigued by her revelation, but Danitz remains silent, wary of revealing his true purpose. As the conversation unfolds, Klein begins to piece together the clues to the giants' involvement in the lost City of Silver Sun and the Forsaken Land of the Gods, while Danitz sits quietly by the side, dazed by her revelations. Klein's thoughts begin to wander, and he forcefully reined them back, reining in his thoughts as if thinking about something more important than the giants. With the conversation finally over, Klein sets out to find the Hidden Sage, the key to understanding the past and the future, and to uncover the secrets of the Beyonders.

The deacon is about to ask his teammates for their opinions, when a line of text in ancient Feysac appears on the surface of the mirror, dripping with liquid. The word \"punishment\" is blood-red, as if it were dripping with fluid. The expression on Ikansers face is twisted at first, before it turns abnormally serious. In this dreamlike scene, the man in the black double-breasted frock coat appears once again, and it's his turn to ask the question, based on the principle of reciprocity. If you answer wrong or lie, you will be punished, the dreamlike deacon warns.

Stuart is impressed by Klein's wealth and charm, describing him as the best detective he's ever met. Meanwhile, Klein is busy brewing instant coffee, preparing beef bone radish soup for dinner. In the evening, the doorbell rings, signaling the arrival of a mysterious visitor, who reveals himself to be Emlyn, the handsome but not masculine red-eyed vampire from the Harvest Church. Emlyn grills Klein about his mission, and the detective responds with a knowing smile, revealing that he's received a certificate for practicing medicine without practicing it. As the conversation unfolds, Klein's curiosity about Emlyn's true intentions and intentions grows, and he wonders about the nature of his connection to Backlund, the mysterious city where he's found himself on a mission to uncover the secrets of the supernatural world.

Audrey shares a story about her own childhood, growing up in the Forsaken Land of the Land, a place where the Giant King's Court was once located. As they discuss the history of the East Continent, Audrey learns of a legend that our elves originated from the Western Continent, where the first-generation elves were born. Klein wonders what kind of woman like Cohinem needs a thief to rein in her violent husband, and he wonders if she has the liberal inclinations of a poet.

Klein's thoughts are interrupted by his sister, Melissa, who advises him to keep his promise to find the real Will Au and talk to him. As Klein and Melissa head out into the streets, the sky is gray and misty, a common scene in Backlund's deep winter. The smog isn't as thick and pungent as last year, but the geographical environment and climate characteristics have determined that such situations will exist for a long period of time, and victory over environmental pollution is never something that can be declared in a year or two.

This is something that can't be influenced with luck, and at the very least, no one below Sequence 0 can do so. Klein uses Creeping Hunger to flash to another side, avoiding the Blood Moon Arrow created by Abomination's Shaman King. He then grabs at the void, summoning a scarlet flame as he constantly jumps within them, summoning the leader of the Church of Evernight's ascetics, the angel of the Concealment domain, Arianna. At that moment, Klein hears an extremely evil roar, and his mind goes blank, leading him to lose the help of the Chained God's projection and be thrown from the state of being the one who laid in ambush to the one being besieged by four powerful angels. As Klein struggles to regain his bearings, he's forced to rely on his short-distance \"Blinking\" spells to navigate the treacherous terrain.

Meanwhile, Klein takes out Azik's copper whistle from inside his body, making the side with fewer patterns appear under the sunlight, making it reflect the light. The copper whistle has Senor's figure appear on it as it rapidly turns clear, and Klein begins to study the powers a Wraith has, including Forceful possession, Mirror Blink, Obstacle Penetration, death-related spells, and Forceful Possession's Shriek. On its reflective side, Klein finds a gold coin, Death Knell, and his suitcase, containing Creeping Hunger and Groselle's Travels, which he plans to sell to pay off his debt with Miss Messenger. As Klein navigates the treacherous seas, he navigates his way to Pritz Harbor, where he finds himself in a grayish-white fog, surrounded by buildings that have collapsed and charred spots.

He asks about her goals, and she reveals that she failed to achieve what she wanted to achieve in Backlund, and that she predicted the Feysacians would start the war in the second half of this year. Klein ponders the implications of this, suspecting that Mr. Azik's life in the Northern Continent had always been under the arrangement of Amon's brother. As he ponders this, he also wonders about \"He,\" who had lost his memories, and how he managed to escape from the Klein and Queen Mystic's clutches. Bernadettes reveals that \"He\" had recently changed, prompting Klein to wonder if there was any prior warning, or something worth paying attention to. She also reveals that he once told her, \"Haven't you always wanted to know what's surrounding our moon and other planets? In the future, our journey might be towards the sea of stars.\" Klein's thoughts are triggered by this revelation, and he realizes that the \"sea of stars\" refers to Emperor Roselle, who might've succeeded before being \"assassinated\" by Mr. Door.

The messenger's actions shock Klein, but he quickly recovers, placing the letter in his pocket, along with the Slumber Charms. As he exits the carriage, he notices Cesare's relaxed smile, as if he hadn't noticed anything unusual that had happened. Klein returns to his room, where he takes out the letter and begins to read it seriously, inferring that Azik has encountered the powers of many different Beyonders in his earlier lives. He concludes that Mr Azik would find any mystical item that corresponds to a particular Sequence's abilities that can be imagined, including the Unshadowed, Demon Guardian, or Hunter. With this information in mind, Klein decides to try out the sacrificial ritual he knows of, using the complex symbol on the back of his chair at the ancient bronze table. He recalls the Pupil-less Eye, which represents secrecy, and the partial contorted lines which represent change.
