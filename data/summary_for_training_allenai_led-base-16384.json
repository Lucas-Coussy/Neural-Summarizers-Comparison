{"num_chp":704,"summary":"On the undulating sea, inside an ancient and dark sailboat.\nAlger Wilson stood in front of a window, considering the report he had to produce when he arrived at Pasu Island. It was at that moment when the endless gray fog and a figure lording over him appeared.\nHe then saw a dark red glow and saw a blurry figure resembling The World. He then heard the figure's calm words.\nAfter hearing it, Alger's eyes widened. He found it difficult to suppress his joy as a strong sense of bewilderment and shock emerged within his heart.\nHe remembered very clearly that The World had only promised The Sun to obtain the Notary potion formula within three days at the last Tarot Club gathering. He hadn't mentioned anything related to the Ocean Songster potion formula, but in just days, this gentleman had obtained the rare Sequence 5 formula and even its main ingredient!\nWhat did he do exactly?Alger muttered silently to himself as he couldn't help but recall Gehrman Sparrow's cold and formidable appearance. He found the man more and more unfathomable.\nIs this the advantage of being a Blessed? Yes, I just received the news yesterday that Gehrman Sparrow boarded the Future last week in Nas. On the one hand, it proves that Admiral of Stars is indeed The Hermit, and on the other hand, it means that what The World did last week was extremely important. For example, entering those dangerous waters in the eastern front to obtain something. Therefore, he had no choice but to seek The Hermit's help? As such, he advanced and became a Sequence 5 powerhouse?\nThis can explain how he obtained the Ocean Songster potion formula and its main ingredient in the span of a few days... But what did he do exactly? Don't tell me that he killed someone from the middle-upper echelons of the Church?Alger couldn't help but frown.\nHe quickly calmed his heart as he focused on another matter.\nAlthough instantly obtaining the formula and main ingredient delighted and excited him, making him feel that becoming a Tarot Club member was a turning point in his life, he still needed to pay for it!\nWhat can I give The World...Alger fell into deep thought, depressed to realize that he didn't have any items or money of equal value.\nHe subconsciously paced about his window.\n...\nAbove the gray fog, the busy World vanished as Klein cast his eyes on Groselle's Travels which he had brought above the gray fog.\nThis book comprised of yellowish-brown goatskin was silently placed on the long bronze table. It didn't appear special in any way, appearing so ordinary that only history fans would notice it.\nKlein conjured a pen and paper as he cautiously wrote the first divination statement: \"This is the Spectator pathway's Uniqueness.\"\nHe was most worried about this point, as it meant that he couldn't seal the book above the gray fog. It might bring about unexpected accidents, but carrying it with him made it possible for him to be sucked into the book at any time. That would be very problematic.\nHe undid the spirit pendulum on his left wrist, composed himself, and attempted a divination.\nWhen he opened his eyes, the topaz pendant was spinning counterclockwise.\nIt meant a negative result.\nFrom the looks of it, this strange book isn't the Spectator pathway's Uniqueness. Then, there's no need to be too afraid...Klein thought for a few seconds before divining if Groselle's Travels was the corresponding item of the Spectator pathway's Sequence 1 or 2. To his surprise, the divination ended in a failure.\nHmm...he thought for a long while before penning a new divination statement: \"Its origins.\"\nThe reason why Klein dared to do such a divination was because he knew very well that the Spectator pathway's Sequence 0 had long perished. There was a high chance that the Uniqueness was in the hands of the Twilight Hermit Order. Therefore, the chances of him having to face a real god was negligible.\nPutting down the pen and holding the paper and book, Klein leaned back into the chair and recited the divination statement as he entered a dream with Cogitation.\nThe gray, hazy world cracked open as the sky turned extremely dark. It was as though strong winds were stirring the dark clouds.\nIn this dark environment, a sliver of light appeared first along the horizon as it grew bigger and clearer.\nIt was a floating continent!\nIt was a huge continent that could hold several cities!\nThe continent's periphery was grayish-white in color. Huge boulders revealed their outlines, and above them, there were dozens of erect hundred-meter-tall stone columns. They either stood independently or propped up magnificent ancient palaces.\nDragons of different colors-grayish-white, scarlet-red, yellowish-bronze-as well as some made of ice, were flying over the continent and the one-of-a-kind city. At times, they would land on a stone column to rest as they overlooked the land. At other times, they would enter the opulent palace and vanish from Klein's sight.\nAmong them, the smallest one was about the size of King of the North Ulyssan. The biggest spanned a hundred meters.\nThe scene quickly zoomed in as a palace with a height of over two hundred meters occupied Klein's vision.\nIts interior had stone columns erected, propping up a dome. The space was so large that it allowed any dragon to move freely within.\nThe \"camera\" kept moving inward, and soon, Klein saw a book made of yellowish-brown goatskin. Its cover was blank as it floated in midair. Compared to its surroundings, it was amazingly small.\nRight behind the book, a large shadow appeared.\nJust as the shadow's silhouette was outlined, Klein felt his thoughts instantly explode!\nHis eyes spewed out with blood as his ears were left with two black holes. His mouth and nostrils had white matter stained with blood spew out from them.\nThe mysterious space above the gray fog gently trembled as it pacified everything. Klein quickly recovered as he gritted his teeth and rubbed his head.\nIt hurts! It freaking hurts!\nIt's in no way inferior to the Eternal Blazing Sun. I didn't even discern \u2018His' looks or gain any knowledge...\nWas \"He\" Dragon of Imagination Ankewelt? According to Little Sun's information, \"He\" had perished at the end of the Second Epoch. After so many epochs, spanning two to three millennia, just prying into the mystery was enough to put me in such a sorry state. If not for the gray fog's screening and assistance, I would've died immediately... This mark is way too powerful, isn't it?\nThere's no way of comparing them. Its damage is inferior to the previous encounter with the Eternal Blazing Sun, but one had died long ago, while the other is still alive. It just begs the question if the ancient gods are stronger than the real gods of the present day...\nUsing nearly a minute to recover from the pain, Klein recast his gaze on Groselle's Travels. He tapped the mottled table's edge and muttered silently,This book's \"author\" is Dragon of Imagination Ankewelt?\nA book written by an ancient god, a storybook that can automatically deduce the ending?\nWhat is \"His\" goal? When this book was formed, the Dragon of Imagination likely hadn't encountered the ancient sun god and was fine. After all, it would take some time to go from the City of Miracles, Liveseyd, to the Giant King's Court. And before Groselle was swallowed by the book, the Giant King's Court was clearly still in existence.\nJust a prank? A toy used to kill \"His\" boredom? Or could it be that the Dragon of Imagination had foreseen some of the future. \"He\" specially created this book to leave behind a chance for \"Himself\" or the dragons to resurrect. However, he underestimated the ancient sun god's might, and he completely perished. It made the book unusable for millennia, so all it could do was naturally absorb characters into it to play out a story?\nKlein made some guesses, but he wasn't able to verify them. After some consideration, he thought of finding a chance to enter the book in search for clues.\nIn the future, I can enter as a Spirit Body above the gray fog. Once I encounter any trouble, I'll immediately return... Yes, I'll make the attempt after I'm no longer with Edwina and Anderson. I have to be careful and cautious...Klein nodded as he divined if leaving Groselle's Travels above the gray fog would bring undesirable changes to the mysterious space, but he was met with failure again.\nAs for the reason, he actually knew why. This was a place that transcended the spirit world. Divining about matters involving this area naturally failed if attempts were made to obtain revelations from the spirit world.\nAfter deciding to frequently come above the gray fog to take a look so as to prevent any accidents, Klein threw Groselle's Travels into the junk pile. He then waved his hand, summoning a golden wine cup that had been partially flattened.\nThe cup had complicated patterns engraved on it, with the Elvish phrases \"Calamity\" and \"Cohinem.\" Apart from that, there wasn't anything special.\nWith it in hand, Klein silently rubbed it for a few seconds.\n...\nKnock, knock, knock!\nKlein politely knocked on the door to the captain's cabin.\n\"Is there something?\" Edwina, who had let down her hair, looked at Gehrman Sparrow and asked.\nKlein handed over the elf queen's golden wine cup.\n\"Put this in Siatas's tomb.\"\n\"... Alright.\" Edwina fell silent for two seconds before nodding and receiving it.\nShe habitually studied the engravings and symbols on the cup before withdrawing her gaze in embarrassment. She then looked out the window and said, \"They'll be organizing a bonfire party. Will you be participating?\"\n\"No.\" Klein shook his head.\n\"I understand. I don't plan on participating either. Not everyone is like Anderson, who can quickly raise his spirits,\" Edwina said with pursed lips.\nActually, it's not necessarily a bad thing...Klein was momentarily at a loss for a response. And apart from \"giving lessons,\" Edwina wasn't good at socializing. Immediately, the two of them fell silent.\nAbout ten seconds later, Klein silently inhaled and broke the silence.\n\"Are you selling that key that originates from the giants?\"\n\"Yes.\" Edwina thought about it before glancing at her collector's room. She added, \"I can lend it to you for studying. You can decide whether to buy it before leaving the ship.\""}
{"num_chp":801,"summary":"After a brief moment of stupefaction, Emlyn couldn't help but look around. He suspected that The World was lurking around him, as though he was one of the nearby believers.\nAfter all, he had never mentioned the Mental Terror Candle at the Tarot Club. Bishop Utravsky seldom had conflicts with others, so he almost never used any mystical items. If it wasn't because Emlyn had been planted with a psychological cue to frequently head to the Harvest Church and received the heads-up from Sherlock Moriarty, he wouldn't have asked the bishop and learned of the existence of the Mental Terror Candle.\nAt that instant, everyone looked like The World to Emlyn. Be it the plump middle-aged man, the granny with a gray headscarf, or the fashionable beauty, he felt that all of them looked like they had something similar to The World.\nNo, I must figure it out. He's actually so aware of my surroundings... I haven't mentioned certain things even while in front of Mr. Fool...Emlyn was left in utter shock as he stood up and walked to the clergymen's break room at the back. In a quiet and empty environment, he replied, \"Honorable Mr. Fool, I wish to directly communicate with The World.\"\nIn less than ten seconds, Emlyn saw a dark red glow surge forward like a tidal wave and devour him.\nThen, he found himself back above the gray fog. He was inside the majestic palace and was seated at his seat.\nAnd at the other end of the mottled table was the blurry-figure of The World who was waiting for him.\nCompared to before, Emlyn had changed tremendously. He wasn't in a rush to speak to The World, and he instead bowed to Mr. Fool, who was leisurely watching at the other end of the table, before looking at his target.\n\"How did you know that I can get the Mental Terror Candle?\"\nUnder Klein's control, The World said with a hoarse laugh, \"We might have met before.\"\nHe didn't speak further and only mentioned the key point. As for whether Emlyn could figure out the situation, that wasn't his problem.\nOf course, Klein believed that Emlyn lacked the ability to connect The World to Sherlock Moriarty since he lacked the necessary clues.\nEmlyn frowned bit by bit as he had a few targets of suspicion, but he wasn't able to determine who was The World.\n\"Believe me. I have no ill intentions towards the members of the Tarot Club,\" The World added when he saw Emlyn in a state of prolonged silence.\nHeh, there will be a day when I'll find you!Emlyn silently muttered to himself as he asked, \"What are you going to do with the Mental Terror Candle? I need to have a substantial reason to borrow such a mystical item.\"\nKlein controlled his urge to rub his temples as he made The World turn solemn and say, \"To treat my psychological problems.\"\nTreat... psychological problems...Emlyn couldn't help but shrink his body back before straightening it again.\nLooking back at The World, his eyes clearly indicated that The World really was a dangerous lunatic.\n...The Mental Terror Candle does have such effects,Emlyn thought for a moment and said, \"I can only borrow it for half a day. There wouldn't be any problems, right?\"\nKlein held back the horror and pleas that were running through his mind as he controlled The World to answer, \"No problem.\"\nIf the Mental Terror Candle was effective, Klein could finish the problem in fifteen minutes. If it wasn't of any use, it would be the same even if he possessed it for days or months. Therefore, the rental duration wasn't critical. He didn't mind such restrictions at all.\nEmlyn did a count and said, \"The rental fee will cost 300 pounds, as well as five pages of Beyonder powers in Leymano's Travels.\"\nHe decided to outsource half of the debt he had.\nFive pages... How many pages did this fellow use...As Klein lampooned, he made The World reply, \"That wouldn't be an issue.\"\nAfter closing the deal, Emlyn immediately returned to the real world and walked into the Harvest Church's break room for the clergymen.\nCasting his gaze to the side of the altar and waiting for Bishop Utravsky to finish talking to the believers, Emlyn suddenly fell into a dilemma.\nAlthough he sounded confident in front of The World, he had never tried borrowing similar items from the bishop. He had no idea what kind of attitude the bishop would have.\nAs his gaze darted around, Emlyn subconsciously surveyed the tiny prayer hall.\nI've helped Father rescue many commoners who were infected by the plague, and have been teaching those who wish to learn about herbs. I've made the faith of Mother Earth spread quite significantly in this borough. What's wrong with borrowing the Mental Terror Candle for half a day?Emlyn raised his chin and walked to Bishop Utravsky, who he needed to look up at, and cleared his throat.\n\"I have a friend that has a psychological problem. I wish to borrow the Mental Terror Candle.\"\nHe didn't directly mention his contributions, because his pride didn't permit him to do so.\nUtravsky looked down at the priest-robed Emlyn and smiled warmly.\n\"Okay.\"\n...That's it?Emlyn was stunned, finding it unbelievable that the bishop would agree so easily.\nHe didn't immediately accept it as he couldn't help but ask, \"Aren't you afraid that I'll lose the candle?\"\nUtravsky replied with a smile, \"Everyone and every item has its end. They will all return to the earth, buried deep within the soil and sprout, grow, and bloom, one incarnation after another.\n\"That is the fate of all entities. If the Mental Terror Candle is lost, it just means that my connection with it has come to an end. I will need to patiently await the arrangements that fate and Mother have for me.\"\nWhether the Mental Terror Candle is lost depends on fate, but whether I end up being killed by you is also fate?Emlyn lampooned without asking further. He received the strange candle from the half-giant bishop.\nFollowing that, he used the excuse of needing to treat his friend to leave the Harvest Church. He randomly found an inn and set up the sacrificial ritual.\n...\nAbove the gray fog, Klein once again received the Mental Terror Candle.\nMore than half of the mystical item was burnt, and its surface was covered with what looked like human skin. There were a few warts that protruded out.\nThe candle's wick was very short and was entirely black in color. It was covered in thin densely packed scale-like patterns.\nKlein didn't delay, for he didn't wish to give his alternate personality a chance to grow. He wanted to resolve the problem completely while it was still weak; otherwise, what awaited him was the irreversible fate of losing control. Furthermore, the mysterious space above the gray fog would completely screen the negative effects of the combat between the two personalities.\nPhew...Klein slowly exhaled as he extended his hand to summon the Sea God Scepter.\nAt that moment, he didn't do any divination because he couldn't be sure who \"me\" referred to. The outcome would naturally be meaningless.\nPa!\nKlein snapped his fingers and lit the Mental Terror Candle.\nAbove the pitch-black wick, a flame with light-blue spirituality silently glowed, illuminating the palace that looked like a giant's residence.\nUnknowingly, the environment changed as a cupboard, desk, bunk bed, and gas meter appeared in Klein's eyes. The crimson moonlight shone in from outside the windows, covering every item with a crimson veil layer.\nThis was the apartment where the Morettis had lived in!\nThis was the place where Klein Moretti had shot himself to death!\nAt that moment, a figure was sitting at the bottom bunk, looking at the Sea God Scepter-wielding Klein with a warped expression.\nHe had traits like black hair, brown eyes, thin built, average-looking features, a rather deep outline, and a scholarly air to him. He was another \"Klein.\"\nThis \"Klein\" revealed a furious expression as he said, \"You occupied my body, and now you wish for my soul to be obliterated?\n\"I should be Klein Moretti! You despicable, shameless transmigrator. You parasite!\"\nHe appeared to have just grown in strength, and he wasn't able to use the objects in the external world.\nKlein didn't reply as he walked over with a heavy expression.\nThe expression of \"Klein\" slowly changed as fear occupied his eyes.\nHis body scrunched up as he pleaded with a slight tremble, \"Let me go. Let me go.\n\"You snatched my brother, my sister, and my life from me. Isn't that enough?\n\"I'll remain quietly in your body, helping you analyze problems and giving you suggestions. I'll definitely not wrestle control with you over the body.\n\"Let me go. Let me go...\"\nKlein remained silent as he raised his Sea God Scepter-wielding right hand.\nThe \"Klein\" was already awash with tears as he yelled angrily and fearfully, \"I only wanted to remind you!\n\"If I wasn't trying to remind you, why would I have exposed myself!?\n\"Let me go. Let me go... I have no ill intentions!\"\nKlein silently looked at him and made the blue gems on the tip of the Sea God Scepter light up one after another.\nLightning bolts instantly appeared as they twisted and entangled \"Klein,\" like a storm.\nAmidst shrill cries, the figure rapidly dissipated as a bolt of lightning wiped all traces of it.\nAs expected of myself... To know the soft spots in my heart and which are the most effective ways to plea... However, I've already come to know who I am. I'm Zhou Mingrui who has fused with Klein's memories and emotions. If I were to let you go, it would be equivalent to splitting the two up, admitting that they are opposing parties. That way, I'll immediately lose control once I return to the real world...Klein lowered the scepter and closed his eyes as he sighed silently.\nThen, he ultimately maintained his lucidity as he left the mind world."}
{"num_chp":1168,"summary":"In the blink of an eye, Amon saw the grayish-white fog and the ancient and majestic palace above.\n\"He\" just needed to reach out \"His\" hand and pass through the final obstacle to truly touch Sefirah Castle and directly occupy the place and, in essence, take it away.\nBut at that moment, a gigantic bluish-black palm suddenly appeared above the Amon phantom, blocking \"Him\" from entering Sefirah Castle.\nAmon's projection subconsciously turned its head and looked in the direction of the palm. It saw the pus-covered, one-eyed giant who had long since died.\nBladel, who was known as the God of Glory, still didn't show any signs of life in \"His\" exaggerated vertical eye. The curse of the grayish-yellow fog kept emanating from \"His\" body.\nHowever, it was different from before. There were seemingly illusory black tubes behind \"His\" back. They extended all the way into the infinite distance, a mystery as to what they were connected to.\nBoom!Read latest chapters at L istnovel\nThe towering bluish-black giant instantly condensed a broadsword formed from the orange-red light of dusk. Holding it in one hand, \"He\" cleaved down at the side of the deep ravine where Amon's body was.\nThis youngest son of the Giant King, the one who had died due to the curse, suddenly unleashed an unimaginable power after roaming aimlessly for thousands of years.\nThe \"Twilight Sword\" tore through the void and jumped out from the spot where the Angel of Time, Amon, was standing. It ripped through everything around it, turning into a storm that could destroy this desolate moor.\nAmon didn't move and remained standing there. No matter how the orange-red \"sword\" storm raged, it didn't harm \"Him\" at all.\n\"He\" seemed to have used some sort of \"error\" in this world again.\nHowever, in this state, Amon was no longer able to transmit \"His\" ravings into Klein's mind, allowing him to finally gain a sliver of peace.\nIgnoring how he was about to lose control, he regained his clarity of mind using the clear and real surroundings and the layers of prayer. Then, he immediately resonated with the dark red \"figure\" sitting at The Fool's seat above the gray fog, and he established a new connection.\nHe didn't hesitate to return to Sefirah Castle!\nAnd at this moment, Amon's phantom, which was attempting to infiltrate above the gray fog, was obstructed by the bluish-black palm of the God of Glory, Bladel. \"He\" wasn't able to instantly break through the titanic obstruction.\nThe monocled King of Angels, be it \"His\" avatar or true body, opened \"His\" mouth and said a name, \"Evernight.\"\nYes, this was help coming from the Evernight Goddess, but it wasn't without reason!\nAlthough Klein lacked confidence in this matter, he had always kept it as one of his trump cards. He only believed that it might not be effective and had a very low chance of success. It could only be used as a glimmer of hope at his most desperate hour.\nAfter entering the Forsaken Land of the Gods and obtaining some space to think on his own, he worked hard to find \"resources\" available to him that could be used. Then, he recalled something:\nThe matter of the former Chief of the City of Silver!\nThis Demon Hunter had attempted to switch to Sequence 3 Ferryman of the Death pathway, but he ended up turning into a monster inside the mausoleum he built.\nThis anomaly was related to illusory black tubes, and such a phenomenon had been seen from the Numinous Sect's Artificial Death.\nIn other words, the mutation of the former Chief of the City of Silver was very likely related to Artificial Death.\nThis indirectly explained something-that for some unknown reason, those that could influence the Forsaken Land of the Gods, other than the True Creator, included Artificial Death who had come to \"life\" to a certain level.\nAnd now, Artificial Death could be considered the Evernight Goddess in some ways!\nBased on this reasoning, Klein suspected that the Goddess could use the Uniqueness of the Death pathway to exert a low level of influence to some degree on certain things in the Forsaken Land of the Gods.\nIn addition, there were only three people involved in the matter regarding the former Chief of the City of Silver. One of them was the current Chief, Colin Iliad; the demigod Elder, Waite Chirmont, and Shepherd Elder, Lovia. They were either Sequence 4 saints or an important believer of the True Creator. It was impossible for them to be completely unaware that they had been \"parasitized\" by Amon.\nAs for the only person who received feedback from the escapade, it was Derrick Berg who was under The Fool's watch. He wasn't one of Amon's \"Parasites\" either.\nIn other words, Amon wasn't aware of the former City of Silver Chief's abnormality involving the black illusory tubes. That was key.\nTherefore, even if \"He\" was able to guess that the Evernight Goddess had obtained the Uniqueness of the Death pathway, causing the God of Combat to have an intense reaction, there was no way for \"Him\" to know that this would bring about unforeseen developments to the Forsaken Land of the Gods.\nWith this knowledge in mind, Klein consciously performed certain tasks, despite not having much confidence.\nIn the city that believed in the phoenix, he didn't take away the remaining Death pathway's Beyonder characteristics, hoping to leave a trail.\nAfter summoning Zaratul's historical projection, he didn't seize the opportunity to commit suicide immediately. On the one hand, he was afraid that Amon would still have the ability to stop him and affect his other arrangements; while on the other hand, he tried to use the summoning of the Servant of Concealment Arianna's projection to inform the Evernight Goddess about the exact situation.\nAfter completing these two matters, Klein had no idea what the final outcome would be. He had mostly focused his attention on the fact that Amon's avatar had been replaced by \"His\" true body.\nWhen he arrived at his final destination and saw the roaming angel's corpse, he had just thought of something when he was distracted by Amon's introduction. It took him only until now to realize that the Goddess had long gained some rudimentary control of this Giant King's youngest son through the Death pathway's Uniqueness. \"She\" had been patiently waiting for an opportunity to use this cursed angel.\nAnd the concealment forces that filled the Forsaken Land of the Gods helped \"Her\" conceal the illusory black tubes very well.\nSuddenly, in the ancient palace above the gray fog, at The Fool's seat situated at the end of the long, mottled table, the dark red figure that kept warping and scattering took the form of the scholarly Klein with his black hair and brown eyes.\nWith just a thought, Klein's consciousness and Spirit Body had returned to Sefirah Castle!\nFollowing that, he used the close connection between his body and Sefirah Castle, together with the prayers of the Tarot Club members, to amplify the resonance effect. He then saw himself-glazed eyes, on the brink of losing control. He saw Amon's projection which had circled around the bluish-black palm using an \"error.\"\nThe monocled Amon raised \"His\" head, making eye contact with Klein, who was seated at The Fool's seat.\nKlein beckoned for the Sea God Scepter and raised it.\nThe entire gray fog boiled as the entirety of Sefirah Castle quaked.\nA vast amount of terrifying power gathered over, transforming into a torrent of lightning. The blue gems that lit up at the same time sent an illuminating light that surged down like a torrent, drowning Amon's avatars and his own body.\nA deep rumble of thunder echoed as the terrifying silver lightning tore everything it enveloped apart.\nAmon's projection disintegrated, and Klein's body was destroyed.\nHe had finally succeeded in committing suicide.\nAfter completing this attack, Klein, who was high above the gray fog, immediately cut off the connection between Sefirah Castle and the real world, so as to prevent Amon's true body from creating any new accidents.\nRight on the heels of that, he began to wait for the \"miracle\" and waited for his \"resurrection.\"\nBeside the deep ravine which had grayish-white buildings at the bottom, Amon's true body adjusted the crystal monocle, stealing the curse that kept Bladel \"existing.\"\nThe bluish-black giant immediately began to rot, quickly being reduced to bones. The illusory black tubes didn't persist, and they instead shrank back into the depths of the darkness.\nDressed in a pointed hat and a classic black robe, Amon stood there. \"He\" raised \"His\" head and looked into the sky silently for a few seconds, as though he was looking at Sefirah Castle through the fog of history.\nFinally, \"He\" pinched the crystal monocle and muttered to \"Himself\" as the corners of \"His\" mouth curled up.\n\"Interesting.\"\n...\nIn the ancient palace, at the end of the long, mottled table, Klein sat at the seat belonging to The Fool. He carefully looked down at the grayish-white fog.\nHe discovered that the Beyonder characteristics that had been destroyed with his body had unknowingly entered the Historical Void. It fused with the Worms of Spirit from the past, turning them corporeal.\nAs long as Klein willed it from Sefirah Castle, these Worms of Spirit would immediately be able to escape the fog of history and reform his body in the real world.\nThe miracle of \"resurrection\" was essentially a deeper use of one's strength from the past.\n\"Miracles\" happen using the past and future? Klein frowned slightly as he attempted to analyze how the \"Miracle\" in Miracle Invoker came about.\nAfter thinking for a few seconds, he quickly pulled his attention back and attempted to revive himself in Sefirah Castle. Then, he discovered a problem:\nHis body could only be revived in the real world. Furthermore, it had to be within a certain range of his remains. As for his Spirit Body, it could be reborn above the gray fog, but Klein's Spirit Body hadn't been destroyed-it was sitting on the high-back chair of The Fool.\nObtaining help from the past works. The number of resurrections I'm using now is depleting the number I'll have after I become a Miracle Invoker... From the looks of it, there's only one chance now. Tsk... Amon should be guarding my \"corpse\" now. I have to think of a way to get out of this predicament...\"His\" sense of time is different from a human's. He's a very patient God of Mischief... Yes, my current state can only be maintained for three days. After that period of time, I won't be able to borrow powers from the past to resurrect... If it really doesn't work, I'll just abandon my body and become an undead! Klein's mind raced. Although he was somewhat vexed, he was in his most relaxed state over the past few days.\nHe finally got out of that nearly hopeless situation.\nHe looked at the high-back chairs that had symbols light up on their backs, as well as the burgeoning and contracting dark red stars. Klein exhaled and relaxed as he leaned back into his chair. He couldn't help but reveal a smile.\n\"These are my anchors.\"\nAuthor's Note: This arc has finally come to an end. The whole story's origins was when I was reading the Cthulhu myth. When I saw the line about the stars being right, I suddenly thought of this: We often say that Cthulhu will awaken soon, but what happens if Cthulhu has already awakened...? For those who don't know much about Cthulhu, it doesn't matter. Just treat this name as an evil god. After all, the corresponding deities were completely reconstructed by me."}
{"num_chp":981,"summary":"After hearing Macht's reply, and combining what he knew, Klein guessed that the rat in the manor was likely the Marauder demigod which had been by Hazel's side. As for why it went rabid and bit Hazel, he was unsure.\nHe nodded slightly and tapped his chest four times in a clockwise fashion.\n\"May the Goddess bless her.\"\nAfter saying that, he walked past the host, entered the hall, and waited for the ball tonight to begin.\nIn a particular bedroom on the third story, Hazel was sitting on a reclining chair feeling dispirited, her feet curled up.\nHer left hand was wrapped in thick bandages, but there weren't any more signs of blood. Her expression was heavy, nothing like her usual arrogance.\nIn the manor, her teacher, that was in the form of a rat, had suddenly bitten her. This resulted in her being stuck in a similar state, her entire being turbid and muddled. It was as though it wasn't her hand that was bitten but her heart.\nTo Hazel, although her arrogance stemmed from her upbringing, with her ability to absorb new information exceeding that of the average person's, her outstanding looks, her family's standing in high society, and her maturity compared to her peers, those feelings were still within normal boundaries before she gained extraordinary powers. None of the aforementioned traits made her feel that she was different from others or that she was fundamentally superior to ordinary people.\nTherefore, with her teacher, who maintained her sense of arrogance while being a representation of her fortuitous encounter and the source of her strength, suddenly becoming a real rat-to the point of not being able to speak clearly and even bite her without any reason-it left a deep impact on her. She began to question if supernatural powers represented being extraordinary or a monster.\nAmidst her thoughts, Hazel subconsciously pulled her black-green hair to the back of her ear and felt frustrated with the melody that came from downstairs.\nAt this moment, she heard the creaking sound of the door as she turned her head in hesitation.\nWalking in was a gray rat with slick fur. Its eyes were deeper than its kind, closer to dark red.\n\"Hazel,\" the rat said in a deep voice.\nHazel was first taken aback before she reeled in delight. She hurriedly stood up and blurted, \"Teacher, y-you've recovered?\"\nJust as she said that, she saw gray rats crawling out from the corner of her bedroom, balcony, and bed. All of them had dark red eyes but could only produce squeaking sounds.\nHazel took a step back in shock, overturning the reclining chair. Her body staggered, almost to the point of collapsing. It took her a great deal of effort to recover her balance.\nAt this moment, she discovered that the red-eyed rats had vanished. The door had been shut tightly, having never opened.\nEverything that had happened was a hallucination or a nightmare that stemmed from the worries inside her!\nAfter a moment of silence, Hazel pursed her lips and sighed.\nShe sat back down, raising her hand to her temples.\nAs she massaged her temples, she frowned slightly. She had a nagging feeling that what had happened was too surreal.\nHer dark brown eyes darted about slightly as Hazel removed the necklace she wore around her neck, clenching it in her palm.\nThe necklace's seven green gems were equidistant from each other. Embedded around them were tiny diamonds.\nAt this moment, one of the gems lit up slowly, emitting a green glow, giving her face a sheen and filling her eyes with mysterious symbols.\nThe scenes from before surfaces in the girl's mind as her blurry dream-like state gradually turned clear.\nWhile observing the scenes, Hazel sensed something amiss. She confirmed that she hadn't been dreaming, nor was it a short hallucination from having her mind go adrift. Instead, she had been thrown into an illusion for nearly ten seconds.\nCryptologist!\nThis... Hazel's dark brown eyes widened as she muttered a word filled with horror.\nShe jumped to her feet and looked around anxiously but failed to discover anything.\nBut the more she looked, the more terrified she became. She had no idea what she would encounter next, nor did she understand what the person who created the dream was up to!\nThe only thing she was certain of was that the other party's level and strength in the supernatural domain far exceeded hers!\nThis shattered what little pride she had left.\nAfter a few minutes, the entire bedroom remained silent. The brisk melody from downstairs instantly connected oneself to the current dance steps.\nHazel finally composed herself, believing that nothing would happen next.\nOnly then did she have the mood or energy to consider the motives of the person who secretly cast the illusion.\nAs various thoughts surfaced in her mind, Hazel suddenly came up with a theory:\nThe person from before was here for her teacher!\nThrough the illusion, the person had confirmed her teacher's current situation!\nIs it Teacher's friend, or an enemy? He's definitely headed off to look for Teacher. What do I do? He likely doesn't know where Teacher is hiding... No, all my neighbors know that I was bitten by a rabid rat... Hazel was thrown into panic as she clenched her necklace with increasing strength.\nShe couldn't be sure of the motives of the other party, nor did she know what she could do.\nShe wished to head to the manor and inform her teacher, but she was afraid of encountering danger and end up being sacrificed.\nFurthermore, her teacher had seemingly lost the ability to communicate. Her warnings might not necessarily be conveyed.\nWithout realizing it, Hazel stood up and paced about in her bedroom. Finally, she made up her mind. Pursing her lips tightly, she walked to the door and said to her lady's maid outside, \"I'm a little tired. I plan on sleeping now. Don't let anyone disturb me.\"\n\"Yes, my lady,\" the maid immediately replied.\nAfter closing the door, Hazel began changing into clothes that allowed for greater movement. Her expression was extremely heavy as her teeth bit down on her lip.\nShe had finally decided to warn her teacher at the manor.\nShe didn't wish to become a seemingly arrogant person but, in actuality, was a coward, one who would abandon all principles upon encountering danger!\nShe found it despicable of herself!\nWhile the bodyguards were focusing their attention on the ball's attendees, Hazel took the opportunity to enter the garden using a water pipe from the balcony. When leaving 39 B\u00f6klund Street, Klein was holding onto a cup of sweet and iced fizzy wine, discussing business in the Southern Continent with a few gentlemen.\nHe turned his head slightly, glancing at the garden. He had already noticed Hazel's actions thanks to his intuition.\n...Although she's not a likable girl, she has quite a kind heart... Klein nodded indiscernibly and praised her inwardly.\nHe wasn't worried about Hazel's actions, because to go from North Borough's B\u00f6klund Street to Macht's manor in Backlund's northwestern suburbs would take three to five hours on carriage. And before she arrived, he would've already used an excuse to leave the ball, teleporting over directly to confirm the situation.\nAlthough Macht's manor was in the northwestern suburbs, it was on the other side of the Tussock River. Hence, to head there, one needed to take a detour to an area with a bridge. It was fine in the day, as one could use the steam metro to head to the south side of the Bridge beneath the river. At night, there were only three bridges to consider. It was inevitable to spend five hours traveling.\nOf course, as Klein had used Tinder before and had read 2-105 Blood Vessel Thief's information, he had some idea about the powers of the Marauder pathway. Therefore, he suspected that Hazel, who had an item of a higher level, could \"steal\" the flight abilities of birds and use that short period of time to cross the river. This way, she might arrive within three hours.\nRegardless, I'll be faster than her... Klein retracted his gaze and began considering who his next dance partner should be.\nTen in the evening, Moose Manor in the northwestern suburbs of Backlund.\nThis place originally belonged to a viscount, and it had more than a hundred years of history. Macht had bought it after his marriage, spending tons of money to maintain it every year so as to invite friends over during winter weekends for a vacation.\nAt this moment, the land steward was arranging for the servants to check every corner and to lock all the windows and doors. This was a necessary procedure before they slept every night.\nA few maids walked out of the wine cellar in a group, heading straight for the kitchen to ensure that all flames had been extinguished.\nThe moment they arrived, they heard squeaking sounds as they looked over, only to discover a grayish-white rat gnawing on a table leg.\nThis rat seemed to sense their gaze, but it didn't run. Instead, it turned its head and glared at them with its slightly red eyes.\nMeanwhile, there were more squeaking sounds as red-eyed rats ran out from the roof beams, storage cabinets, and all kinds of miscellaneous, even appearing beside the furnace which had some water boiling over it.\nThe maids nearly screamed in fear.\nAs members of the lowest classes of society, they were no strangers to rats. They had even killed quite a number. However, it was their first time to encounter so many at once. They couldn't help but feel a heavy blow to their senses.\n\"We need to get Guede and the others to deal with this,\" a maid left the kitchen and suggested in fear.\nAnother maid nodded immediately.\n\"Miss Hazel was bitten by a rabid rat... These don't look normal in any way!\"\nAs they spoke, they retreated a great distance back, distancing themselves from the kitchen.\nAt this moment, a figure quickly appeared on the table. He wore a white shirt and black vest under a dark-colored formal suit. On his head was a half top hat, and he had a pair of bright leather boots.\nThis figure slowly lifted his head while holding down his hat. He surveyed the surroundings, revealing his black hair and brown eyes. He had a thin face and cut features. He was none other than Gehrman Sparrow.\nHaving left the ball ahead of time, Klein returned to Dwayne Dant\u00e8s's residence and entered his bedroom. Then, he teleported over with Winner Enuni.\nOf course, the latter had been left outside the manor to allow for any instantaneous switches in positions.\nThe rats reflected into his eyes as Klein pulled the human-skinned glove on his left hand, casting his gaze towards the flowerbed in the manor.\nAlmost at the same time, the rats in the kitchen stirred as their movements turned sluggish. However, they quickly returned to normal.\nThey had become a Bizarro Sorcerer's marionettes.\nAnd Klein could control as many as 50 marionettes, a number that would rise once he finished digesting the potion!"}
{"num_chp":299,"summary":"West Borough, Grimm Garden Street\nKlein, with a quite a stubble around his mouth, wore a pair of gold-rimmed glasses while carrying a top hat and a black cane. He followed Rogo Colloman into a spacious and bright living room.\nThere was a huge crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling. The walls, corners, and tables were decorated with all kinds of golden carvings and ornaments. The entire area looked gorgeous, exquisite, and luxurious.\nAs expected of a jewelry businessman, a businessman staying in West Borough...Klein scanned the oil paintings by the side and sighed.\nWith every step Rogo took, the fat on his body quivered. It left people maliciously wondering when his clothes and pants would snap.\nHowever, as a jewelry businessman, he had enough money to buy clothes of the best quality.\n\"Detective Moriarty, this is my son, Adol.\" Logo stopped at the edge of a carpet and pointed to a boy that was 15 or 16 years old and was sitting on a single sofa.\nAs all the fireplaces in the house were lit, and there were metallic pipes to conduct the heat around, the living room was rather warm. It even made Klein feel like taking off his clothes until he only had a shirt and a pair of trousers left. However, the boy was wrapped in a thick fur coat and had a blanket that looked burning hot on his legs.\nAt that moment, he had his head low, tightly hugging himself as he shivered nonstop. His dark blue hair seemed to have lost its luster.\nRogo looked at him with concern and raised his voice slightly, \"Adol, this is Detective Moriarty. He will be protecting you for today and tomorrow.\"\nAt these words, Adol raised his head, revealing his pale face, his bluish lips, and his unfocused eyes.\n\"Protect me, protect me... They're going to kill me! They want to kill me!\" His voice became sharper and sharper. In the end, he covered his ears with his hands and screamed.\nAfter a few seconds, he gradually calmed down.\nDuring this process, Klein had already tapped his molars and secretly activated his Spirit Vision.\nHuh...He held back the shock that had crept up to his mouth and carefully examined him again.\nHe saw that the color of Adol's aura had been dyed with a deep blackish-green sheen!\nThis is a sign of being haunted by wraiths, a sign of possible possession!\nAdol's bad friends are already taking revenge on him... Or perhaps, there were no such things as \"bad company\" at all...Klein quietly reached out, held Mr. Azik's copper whistle, and allowed his spirituality to spread. Then, he thoughtfully looked away from Adol and looked at the others inside the living room.\nBy the oriel window stood a man in a black coat. He was tall and sturdy, not smiling, and his waist was bulging as if he were hiding a gun.\nThis should be one of the six bodyguards...Klein was about to size up another person when Rogo Colloman introduced, \"Detective Kaslana; her assistant, Lydia.\n\"Detective Stuart.\"\nAt this point, Rogo turned around and pointed at Klein.\n\"This is Detective Sherlock Moriarty.\"\nKaslana was in her thirties, had black hair and blue eyes, and thick eyebrows. She was probably a beauty when she was young, but now, because of the sagging muscles on her cheeks, she didn't seem very amiable.\nLydia, her assistant, was a red-haired lady of about twenty years of age. Her figure was excellent, but she had an average appearance.\nBoth women wore something similar to what aristocratic riders wore. The white shirts they wore were tight at the waist which matched the more tight-fitting trousers that facilitated movement. The pleats were the only thing that distinguished their clothes from men.\nIn addition, they provided no concealment for the two revolvers around their waists.\nThis reminded Klein of a saying from Lawyer Jurgen that illegal possession of a gun was a sure thing for a private investigator. This was because-unless one was a noble, a Member of Parliament, or a senior civil servant-it was very difficult to obtain an all-purpose weapon permit.\nStuart sat opposite to Kaslana and Lydia. He had a lean face, but he grew a bushy beard. His light green eyes were unusually lively.\nHe was about the same age as Lydia, and almost as tall as Klein, a little over 1.7m and weighing 140lb.\nStuart had an armpit holster, and in it, there was obviously a specially designed revolver.\nAfter exchanging pleasantries, Klein took off his coat, took off his hat, and handed it to the maidservant next to him.\n\"Put it somewhere I can retrieve it quickly from. There are some important items inside.\"\nIn fact, he had already transferred the paper figurines, notes, charms, a matchbox, etc to his trouser pockets. The only thing left in his coat was herbal powder, extract essence, keys, and his wallet. There were a total of 206 pounds in paper bills in his wallet.\nStuart, who was sitting there, turned his head to size Klein up and chuckled. \"You didn't bring a gun?\"\n\"Gun? This is my gun.\" Klein smiled and raised his cane.\nAt the same time, he puffed out his cheeks to stimulate a sound.\nBang!\nThe sound of a gunshot rang out, and without thinking, Stuart rolled over, while Kaslana and Lydia quickly got off the sofa, each finding a place to hide.\nRogo and the servant beside him were both surprised and confused about what was happening. Adol continued keeping his head low as he shivered.\nWhen they saw that Klein was only holding onto a black cane and realized that nothing had happened, Kaslana and company calmed down. They frowned and asked, \"What just happened?\"\n\"Ever since I handed a revolver I picked up to the police, I've been learning how to imitate its sound. It seems to be quite effective,\" Klein replied half-jokingly.\n\"That's not funny, Detective Moriarty,\" Kaslana said in a deep voice.\nI just wanted to perform some magic for you...Klein lampooned. He handed his cane to the maidservant and solemnly nodded.\n\"I will keep that in mind.\"\nStuart, who was in the most pathetic state a moment ago, didn't seem to be angry at all. He patted his clothes with great interest, got up and asked, \"Why haven't I heard of you, Mr. Moriarty? I mean, I know a lot of people in the detective business, but I've not heard about you in the past.\"\n\"I only came to Backlund in early September,\" Klein briefly explained.\n\"Is that so...\" Stuart laughed and said, \"Tonight, the two of us will pair up. We'll be in charge of everything from midnight until tomorrow morning. Will that be a problem?\"\n\"Nope,\" Klein responded with the same smile.\n\"Okay, after dinner, you guys have some rest and take over your shifts in the early morning,\" Kaslana added.\nKlein took a long look at the trembling Adol and nodded seriously.\n...\nNothing happened throughout the afternoon, and the worried male and female hosts prepared a hearty dinner for the detectives and the bodyguards, but no alcoholic beverages were provided.\nAfter eating and drinking to his heart's content, Klein and Stuart, a young man with a full beard, went to their rooms on the second floor.\nSeeing that no one was around, Stuart shook his head and said, \"Sherlock, you should've noticed that the problem with Adol isn't something regarding revenge.\"\nBro, you sure are affable...Klein's expression didn't change as he asked, \"Why do you say that?\"\n\"He looks more like he has a mental problem, or, according to the countryside, he's been haunted by ghosts and evil spirits. Frankly, I'm afraid of that.\" Stuart sighed. \"Mr. Colloman should take him to a psychiatrist, and if that doesn't work, get the priests from the Lord of Storms to sprinkle some holy water and perform a ritual.\"\n\"You can suggest it to him,\" Klein said objectively.\n\"If Adol doesn't get better, I'll consider it in about a couple of days.\" Stuart glanced sideways at Klein.\nKlein laughed and replied, \"That's up to you. My mission will be over tomorrow.\"\nAt that moment, the two of them had arrived at their destination and entered their respective rooms.\n...\nOne in the morning, inside Adol's bedroom.\nKlein sat in a rocking chair, holding onto Azik's copper whistle, quietly watching his ward. Stuart sipped his coffee at his desk.\nThe two of them didn't speak, afraid that they would wake the sleeping Adol.\nAs time passed, a cold chill swept through the room.\nAdol sat up and opened his eyes.\n\"What's wrong?\" Stuart asked somewhat nervously.\n\"To... the washroom...\" Adol replied in a soft, dreamy voice.\nHis face seemed paler, and his lips were turning purple.\nStuart was about to speak when he saw Sherlock Moriarty stand up and nod at him.\n\"I'll follow him.\"\n\"Alright.\" Stuart let out a sigh of relief.\nPutting his hands into his pockets, Klein stayed one step behind Adol and followed him to the entrance of the washroom two rooms away.\nJust as Adol was about to close the door behind him, he saw a figure flash in.\n\"I can't let you out of my sight. Heh, do whatever you have to do, and pretend that I don't exist.\" Klein smiled and leaned against the wall.\nAdol remained silent, his eyes unfocused as he looked into the mirror.\nHe turned on the faucet and let the water flow.\nAt this moment, Klein took out a box of matches and lit a matchstick, as though he wanted to smoke.\nHowever, he didn't do so. He blew on the air and allowed the match to go out.\nPa!\nKlein casually threw the match in front of him and took out another item.\nAdol, whose back was facing him, suddenly straightened up. The figure in the mirror was so pale that it looked like a corpse.\nWhoosh!In the washroom, a cold wind howled. While keeping his lower body fixed, Adol turned around and glared at Klein's left hand, at the delicate copper whistle that was being tossed up and down.\nWhoosh!\nA gust of cold wind blew across Klein's face.\nHe continued smiling and snapped his fingers.\nWith a loud bang, a flame rose from the ground, igniting an invisible figure.\nThe figure struggled for a few moments before completely dispersing. The flames extinguished as a result.\nKlein put away Azik's copper whistle and looked calmly at Adol, whose eyes were beginning to focus.\nAdol appeared to have finally awoken from a long nightmare.\nHe saw a young man standing a few steps away. The man was wearing a white shirt, dark trousers, and a pair of gold-rimmed glasses. He was leaning against the wall with a smile on his face.\nThen, he heard a gentle voice.\n\"What happened to you?\""}
{"num_chp":346,"summary":"10 o'clock at night, in the alley by the back door of the Bravehearts Bar.\nLike the previous time, Klein, in his black double-breasted frock  coat and matching half top hat, had merely circled the bar once before  he walked to the nearest street as though he were on a stroll.\nJust as he walked out of the alley, a carriage stopped in front of  him. Behind the glass window was Maric's pair of brown eyes which were  still suppressing any signs of malicious intent.\nKlein pressed the top of his half top hat and, holding the sturdy  cane in his hand, calmly boarded the carriage as if he had hailed it  himself.\nHe sat down and straightened his bow tie like a gentleman attending a banquet.\n\"That outfit isn't suitable for battle.\" Maric, who was wearing a  white shirt, black vest, and tights, sized him up a few times and  frowned.\nIt was obvious that he still had some doubts regarding Klein's strength, but he had chosen to trust Sharron.\nKlein smiled casually and said, \"My Beyonder powers are different  from yours. Our fighting styles are different too. This type of clothing  will not affect me negatively in any way; it even suits me very well.  For example, it has a lot of pockets, and they can be used to store  different items in different places, so as to avoid taking the wrong  things when in a hurry and losing my life through such a laughable  mistake.\"\nAs he spoke, he took out the remaining three sedatives from a sewn  concealed pocket-they were the special sedatives concocted by the  Apothecary!\nJust as he finished his sentence, a figure quickly outlined itself on a window of the carriage.\nA figure wearing a long black regal dress and a small soft hat.\nIt was none other than the Sequence 5 Beyonder of the Mutant pathway, Wraith Sharron.\n\"You explain too much.\" Sharron looked at Klein and said in an ethereal tone, \"Not natural enough.\"\n... I just wanted to get into the act...Klein laughed dryly and replied, \"Probably it's because I'm a bit nervous.\"\nWithout waiting for Sharron to speak again, he handed the three sedatives to Maric.\n\"Find a chance to drink it yourself.\n\"I'm sure that you're more experienced than I am. You won't drink it  too early or too late, much less drink too little or too much.\"\nMaric looked at the sealed and transparent glass test tube, gently  shaking the liquid inside and said, \"Two and a half. Any more and I will  really be sedated. I wouldn't do anything for a short period of time.\"\n\"Very good,\" Klein praised and turned to look at Sharron. \"Have you guys decided on the ambush spot?\"\nSharron nodded.\n\"We're on the way there.\"\nShe didn't directly reveal the intended location to Klein.\nVery prudent, very careful...Klein thought for a moment before asking, \"Will you be hurt by purification?\"\n\"As a zombie, yes. Same when I'm in my spirit state,\" Sharron explained succinctly.\nIn other words, when a Sequence 5 Wraith is still in their physical state, the purification effects wouldn't be effective...Klein thoughtfully asked, \"What about exorcism?\n\"What about demon-hunting?\"\nAs they were dealing with a Beyonder of the same pathway, Sharron didn't hide anything from him.\n\"Demon-hunting will deal damage to our bodies. Likewise for exorcism,  to both our bodies and spiritual bodies. But it wouldn't be fatal.\"\nKlein curled his lips into a smile and exhaled.\n\"I understand.\"\nHe pondered for a moment, and he asked again after some deliberation, \"Do you feel the power of purification and exorcism now?\"\n\"No,\" Maric replied hoarsely.\nVery good, this spirituality cage, modified from a wall of  spirituality, is indeed able to isolate the effects of the Sun Brooch.  However, I'm so hot...Klein secretly sighed and confirmed, \"Wraith  Steve, Zombie Jason, and Werewolf Tyre, do they have any other mystical  items or Beyonder weapons besides the Scarlet Lunar Corona?\"\n\"We don't know.\" Maric pinched his glabella, looking a bit irritated.\nWith the battle at hand, he couldn't help but be stirred by these emotions while suppressing his maliciousness and desires.\nSharron listened silently and replied without any hints of  discomposure, \"When influenced by the Scarlet Lunar Corona, Jason and  Tyre will be in a rather fervent state.\n\"Even if they have mystical items, they would lack the reason to use them.\"\n\"Unless it's something passive,\" added Maric. \"But to a Werewolf,  their claws are their Beyonder weapons. It's the same for me, Tyre, and  Jason. It can tear through steel and comes with venom.\"\nKlein's eyes darted about as he nodded.\n\"Alright, I have no more questions.\"\nIn the night with few pedestrians, the carriage sped across the  streets, its wheels going over puddles of water from time to time,  splattering fine dirt onto itself.\nAfter ten minutes or so, Maric had the zombie driver stop the carriage.\nKlein looked out through the glass window and saw a dark, dilapidated  building. Not far away, the sound of running water could be heard.\n\"This is the West Balam dock that has been abandoned for a year and  is about to be rebuilt. Our planned ambush point will be around its  warehouses,\" Maric introduced.\nThe abandoned West Balam dock... If an accident were to really  happen, the Tussock River would be the best escape route... According to  my previous survey, there is a Lever Cathedral about two kilometers  northwest of here, one belonging to the Church of the God of Steam and  Machinery...Klein quickly recalled his surroundings.\nHe disembarked from the carriage, tidied up his clothes in a  leisurely manner, and, with his cane in hand, followed Sharron and Maric  into the dock which awaited renovations.\nAfter walking for about five minutes, they came to an open space surrounded by several warehouses.\nThe soil here was dark brown, with withered weeds lying everywhere. A wooden chest quietly sat in a dark corner.\n\"Those are the explosives you asked for.\" Maric pointed.\nKlein immediately nodded and said, \"Aren't you afraid that a tramp might steal them?\"\n\"My zombies are sleeping underground here. If anyone enters, they  will scare that person away.\" Maric pointed to a few other spots. \"Avoid  them when you bury the explosives.\"\n\"No problem.\" Klein smiled and nodded before asking, \"Will my purification and exorcism effects hurt your guys?\"\n\"No, they are equivalent to corpses when in deep slumber, and there's  also a thick layer of soil shielding them.\" Maric gave an affirmative  answer.\nAfter looking around, Sharron became talkative for once.\n\"Stay here and make your preparations. We'll go and lure the enemy over.\n\"It won't take more than thirty minutes. Please make use of the time.\n\"After you finish your preparations, hide in a warehouse. Don't be in a hurry to make your move. Make sure to be patient.\n\"No matter how dangerous the situation is, treat it as normal.\n\"When I become weak and the Scarlet Lunar Corona appears, you can use  that \u2018eye' to search for Steve and launch a sudden attack on him. I  will also use my mystical item to complement you.\"\nKlein listened attentively, chuckled, and said, \"A very simple plan.\"\n\"The simpler the plan, the more effective it is,\" Sharron calmly responded.\nMaric pinched his forehead, shook his head, and said, \"Steve isn't a  fool. If any problem arises in a complicated plan, it will lead to a  complete disaster.\nAfter they finished their exchange, Sharron vanished and Maric quickly departed from the dock.\nAfter watching them leave, Klein took out a small square metal box  from his pocket. Its surface was covered in a thin film of spirituality.  This was the spirituality cage that had been modified from a wall of  spirituality.\nIt could, to some extent, isolate the outside world from the effects  of certain mystical items, but it couldn't abate the negative effects  they had on the possessor.\nOf course, Sealed Artifacts which were too powerful or too strange  were definitely not something that a spirituality cage could deal with.  They required a special sealing environment that was specially designed  for it.\nFour warehouses, overgrown with weeds. The ground is muddy from the rain earlier...Klein took out a piece of paper and shook it.\nPa!\nThe paper quickly became taut and as hard as an iron plate.\nKlein held the note and dug a shallow hole in the middle of the open  ground. He buried the small square iron box in his hand. There was only a  thin layer of soil between it and the outside world.\nNext, he took out the explosives from the wooden box and buried them in different corners and in different warehouses.\nHe buried the remaining explosive sticks near the center.\nAfter finishing all of this, he took out his revolver and adjusted  the ratio of the bullets again-3 purifying bullets and 2 exorcism  bullets.\nPutting away the revolver in his underarm holster, Klein tidied his  clothes, walked to a gap between two warehouses, and threw a paper  figurine there, right above some buried explosives.\nHe examined his surroundings again, and then he took out another  square metal box. He removed the spirituality cage on its surface and  took out the dark golden sunbird shaped brooch, solemnly wearing it on  his left chest.\nPhew...Klein let out a breath, left the place, circled the  exterior, threw out some inconspicuous items, and burned away the used  piece of paper.\nWhen he returned, he climbed to the top of one of the warehouses and hid in the shadows.\nReaching out his hand, he counted and confirmed the various charms,  extract, and herbal powders. He touched the iron cigarette case and  snapped his fingers.\nThe paper figurine he had left between the two warehouses stood up  and transformed into a gentleman wearing a black double-breasted frock  coat, a silk half top hat, and was holding a hard cane.\nThe gentleman's position was rather remote and hidden, making it  difficult for anyone who came in from the outside to notice him.\nWith his stand-in present, Klein's figure disappeared from where he stood.\nHowever, his vision wasn't affected in any way, and he could clearly see the road that led to the clearing.\nEven though he had made preparations and had experienced many  battles, Klein was still a bit afraid and nervous at that very moment.\nNo matter how good a performance was, it could still be seen through!\nFurthermore, the enemy was a Sequence 5 wielding a mystical item! There was also a Sequence 6 and Sequence 7!\nIs this the state every magician is in before he goes onstage?Klein took a silent breath, suppressing his emotions and the heat of his body.\nThat night, the crimson moon was constantly obscured by the clouds, and there was only a glimmer of light in the clearing.\nBefore long, Klein saw three figures rapidly approaching.\nOne in front, one in the middle, and one at the back!"}
{"num_chp":1083,"summary":"Although the Sonia Sea wasn't like the Fog Sea, with it often being filled with fog, the northern regions would occasionally fill up with a rather thick fog every autumn and winter morning.\nAlger Wilson's Blue Avenger was sailing in such an environment, following the borders of the Sonia Island back to the Loen coast.\nHe had already spent too long in the North Sonia Sea, so he needed to return for a routine report.\nWithin the pale white fog, the ghost ship quietly proceeded forward, occasionally appearing like a dream that didn't leave any traces.\nAlger was wrapped by the wind as he stood in midair in front of the window, admiring the white world outside. He allowed his thoughts to wander in different directions.\nSuddenly, his eyes focused as some silvery-white light flashed in his pupils. He saw a large sail through the fog in the distance, and a massive ship silently cruised past.\nThis ship wasn't alone. Behind it were several similar ships. One, two, three... they formed a fleet that spanned a great distance.\nFeysac's Sonia Sea Fleet... They've all been mobilized... Where are they heading to? Alger's feet landed on the deck.\nHis gaze immediately turned to the other side, where Sonia Island was located.\nAfter the various exchanges at the Tarot Club, Alger was already certain that the world situation was tense, with war about to break out at any moment. At that moment, he made some connections and made a guess.\nTo the Feysac Empire and the Loen Kingdom, Sonia Island was extremely important. If it were occupied by the Loen Kingdom, Feysac's eastern naval fleet would be completely blocked off in the cold north, unable to vie for any of the various colonies in the Sonia Sea or head to East Balam. Meanwhile, after waging war, if they wanted to threaten the Loen Kingdom's hinterlands, they would have to cross the Amantha mountain range or cross the Midseashire, passing through the defenses of several counties. That would be extremely difficult.\nAnd if Sonia Island was conquered by the Feysac Empire, then they could use that as a base to attack all the ports in the north and central regions of Loen, including but not limited to Enmat Harbor or Pritz Harbor. If the Feysac commander was more daring and unfazed by the losses, he could even be able to directly target the capital of the Loen Kingdom, Backlund, which was not far from the port.\nIt was precisely because of this that the two countries had waged the Twenty Year War. The Feysac Empire clinched victory, and they had obtained the crucial southern path.\nIn the Battle of the Violated Oath, Loen had won the war but had failed to regain this territory. Its strategic goals for the war were only half-achieved.\nAlger stared at this scene for a moment before speaking in a serious tone, \"Is war about to erupt...?\"\nIn Backlund, a large number of airships from Feysac had entered from North Borough and arrived above the huge city.\nAs soon as they drew near, the Holy Wind Cathedral seemed to have made certain precautions. The howling of the wind intensified, turning into several giant bluish-black blades that whistled towards the target like surface-to-air missiles.\nSeeing that the huge blades were about to hit the airbags of the airship, an invisible layer of defense appeared and shielded it from all the attacks.\nUnder the violent strike, the transparent \"wall\" shook, but ultimately managed to hold on.\nAt the same time, the compartment for guns, projectile launchers, and cannons of the airship opened up and aimed downwards.\nBoom!\nAs a hurricane around the Holy Wind Cathedral took form, a loud explosive boom emanated in every direction.\nIn such a terrifying storm, the airships were like boats sailing through the sea where they met mountain-like waves and were about to be tossed into the distance.\nAt that moment, the blood and rust-like beams of light flashed on the leading airship. They enveloped all the other accompanying airships and connected them together.\nSuddenly, Feysac's airship fleet had stabilized in the hurricane and was no longer a puny boat in the gigantic waves. The power of the high-level Red Priest pathway belonged to war, and war was the art of gathering the masses!\nThis was the authority of a War Bishop!\nAfter the Feysacians blocked this wave of attacks, they took advantage of the gap in between the wave of attacks to deliver their bombs through the hatches and allow them to drop beneath them.\nAnd in the hurricane, the trajectories of the bombs became unpredictable.\nBoom! Boom!\nThe cannon hatches also lit up and showed off their prowess that would honor the God of War.\nThis airship fleet didn't attempt to travel through Backlund. After entering North Borough, it immediately turned to West Borough, the center of politics for the Loen Kingdom.\nNorth Borough, Backlund University of Technology.\nThe withered Intis parasol tree leaves swayed in the wind. Students were either carrying books or bags as they walked around the campus.\nAs a member of an institute of higher education, as the first batch of students of this reorganized university, these young adults were full of vigor. They looked forward to their future and would gather together every day to discuss their ideals, recite poems, and research technology. They were pure and happy.\nMelissa Moretti walked amidst them as she raised her head to look at the wall clock at the top of the main teaching building and involuntarily hastened her pace.\nShe had to go to Chancellor Moment's office today to prepare for the upcoming mechanical laboratory that was to be officially launched.\nThis was something that she enjoyed greatly, something which made her feel happy every day. She felt that life on campus was so wonderful and that her classmates were so adorable.\nSubconsciously, Melissa looked at the steam locomotive in the middle of the square. Its massive, complicated body was displaying its infinite charm in the machinery industry.\nQuite a number of students liked to gather there, knocking, hitting, and analyzing its structure. As for the school, it didn't encourage or forbid it.\nThe corners of Melissa's lips curled into a smile as she moved to look away.\nSuddenly, a metallic gray object descended from the sky and landed in the middle of the square.\nBoom!\nThe ground shook violently as all the windows of the main teaching building shattered. If not for the distance, Melissa might've been thrown up by the blast of air.\nCountless screams rang out, and like the other students, Melissa fled in panic, not knowing what had happened.\nShe was only 16 years old after all-she had never experienced such a scene before.\nThe billowing dust and smoke gradually fell. After hiding behind a tree, Melissa subconsciously looked at the spot where the explosion had just occurred.\nHer expression instantly froze, and her eyes glazed over.\nThe steam locomotive's head was already in pieces, its components and fragments were scattered everywhere.\nThe students around it, and those passing by, had already collapsed to the ground, their bodies no longer intact. They were no longer breathing. Some of them were covered in blood, others charred. There were some moaning in pain.\nThis scene was like an oil painting that wasn't realistic enough. Melissa stared at it in a daze, momentarily at a loss for a reaction.\nCarter-she knew that male student who had a great spirit for research. Every time everyone was in discussion, he would confidently say that he was going to be a ship engineer. Now, he only had half his lower body left, and his intestines were all over the ground.\nEudora-she was a student from the same faculty as her. Despite studying machinery, she loved poetry very much and was rather talented in this aspect. She was loved by the people around her. Sometimes, Melissa would also attend their gatherings and quietly listen to Eudora's recital. She felt that this girl was really attractive, but now, her leg was badly mutilated, and she was moaning half-consciously in pain.\nIn just a few seconds, these people's future had been cruelly changed.\nIt was only when many teachers rushed out of the teaching block and started to rescue the injured and evacuate the students that Melissa woke up from her trance and hurriedly moved closer to the teachers.\n\"Listen to me! All of you are to split up into two groups. One batch will head to the laboratories, and the other to Tiffany Cathedral. They all have an underground area that you can hide in.\" One of the teachers wore a look of terror, but he still held his breath and made arrangements with his clear voice as though he had been specially trained.\nHe looked around and saw that the students didn't dare to leave the teachers. He hurriedly said, \"Don't worry. The enemy's airship has already turned and gone to West Borough. There's no danger here.\"\nHis words were accompanied by a rumbling explosion that came from the southwest.\nWest Borough... The kingdom's parliament, various departments, and municipal halls are there... Upon hearing the teacher's words, Melissa immediately thought of many things.\nAs the light in her eyes flickered, she suddenly pursed her lips tightly and ran towards the school gate, ignoring her teacher calling from behind.\nAs she moved along a sheltered area, Melissa quickly arrived on the streets. She panted heavily and looked around, trying to get her bearings.\nAt that moment, she saw the subway entrance nearby. Although she was flustered, she still remembered what the teacher had just said.\n\"...underground area that you can hide in!\"\nIsn't the subway underground? The bombing has just started, and the subway probably hadn't stopped moving... As her thoughts raced, Melissa rushed towards the entrance that showed signs of bombardment.\nUpon going underground, she realized that the people here weren't as many as she had expected. Most ordinary people who had never been trained wouldn't think of hiding in here immediately.\nThe subway had indeed not stopped moving, but no one was checking the tickets. After a short wait, Melissa ran over, her lips tightly pursed and her face filled with anxiety.\nAfter three stops, the subway stopped at King's Avenue. Melissa squeezed through the crowd and rushed out of the carriage.\nShe had already recovered her stamina. She ran along the stairs, her speed increasing ever so slightly before she quickly reached the surface.\nAt this moment, whatever she could see was in a state of chaos. Many buildings had collapsed as they were burning in scarlet flames. Broken limbs, blood, and the dead were everywhere. She could hear cries, screams, and orders.\nUpon seeing this scene, Melissa became even more anxious as she tried to run towards the four-story building where the kingdom's Ministry of Finance was located.\nHowever, the area had already been sealed. She could see that many window panes had shattered. The walls were riddled with bullet holes, and there were still traces of an explosion.\nMelissa tried to enter the perimeter but was stopped by the soldiers who were maintaining order. This only served to increase her anxiety as her eyes reddened.\nAt this moment, she saw a familiar figure. It was the black-haired, brown-eyed Benson who wasn't wearing a hat.\nUpon seeing Melissa, Benson immediately rushed over. He looked anxious and angry as he shouted, \"Why are you here? Why aren't you hiding underground! I'm very safe here!\n\"Quick, follow me there!\"\nDidn't you not go underground either... Melissa, who had never been shouted at by her brother, wanted to instinctively retort, but her vision was already blurry.\n\"Phew...\" After he shouted, he let out a breath and softened his tone. \"It's good that you're okay. Quick, don't wander around on the streets.\"\nUpon hearing his words, the panic and concern in Melissa's heart calmed down. At this moment, she felt that even if she were to die, it wouldn't be that scary anymore. At least, she wouldn't be the only one left at home.\nAt this moment, a bomb was blown over by a hurricane and was landing towards the area.\nBut suddenly, the bomb changed directions abruptly and flew off horizontally.\nBoom!\nIt exploded in midair, only stirring up a blast of air."}
{"num_chp":785,"summary":"100 B\u00f6klund Street, in a corner of the garden in Portland Moment's residence.\nThe many ants and worms that were gathering there slowly dispersed as the cold, creepy sensation faded.\nThat person with extraordinary powers likely doesn't have any experience...With her goal achieved, Hazel nodded indiscernibly before turning around briskly and strolling through the garden.\nShe wasn't in a rush to return as she enjoyed the crimson moonlight, the cold air, and the faint flowery scent.\nAfter a long while, Hazel stopped her stroll and left the garden, entering the hall on the first story.\nAt this moment, apart from the guests still playing Texas hold'em, many ladies and gentlemen had bid farewell. Moments after Hazel found her mother, Ma'am Riana, she saw her father, Member of Parliament Macht, and a few other gentlemen walking down as they conversed with lively expressions.\n\"Are you ready to head home? You have to visit a very important guest tomorrow morning.\" As Riana gestured for her daughter to come close, she walked towards her husband and greeted the others with a smile.\nMacht nodded and said, \"I would've loved to try another of Portland's cigars if not for that matter.\"\nRiana swept her gaze to Willis, Dwayne Dant\u00e8s, and company, and she asked in passing, \"Gentlemen, what are you talking about? It sounds interesting.\"\nMacht turned his body to the side and said with a smile, \"Dwayne said that he encountered ghosts when he was in the Southern Continent.\n\"He and his companions suddenly woke up in the middle of the night and found themselves unable to open their eyes. Their bodies were heavy, as though someone was pressing on them.\n\"They used a great deal of strength before escaping such a state and left their beds. However, they discovered their rooms were extremely cold. You might not know this, but East Balam's weather is hot most of the time.\n\"Then, Dwayne and his companions each held double-barreled hunting rifles and stood guard the entire night. They frantically left the town after the sun rose.\"\nAfter hearing that, Ma'am Riana looked at Dwayne Dant\u00e8s with piqued interest.\n\"Is that true?\n\"Do ghosts really exist?\"\nKlein shook his head with a smile.\n\"That I'm not sure of. Perhaps my companions and I had just experienced a harrowing adventure and our bodies and minds weren't in the best of conditions. This might've resulted in all kinds of problems.\"\nThe stories he told were sourced from one of Anderson's experiences. Back when the Strongest Hunter of the Fog Sea was exploring a temple in the primitive forest, he chanced upon a specter, creating a large-scale breakout overnight.\nGhosts...Hazel turned her head to look towards the garden as the corners of her mouth curved up slightly before she held back.\nShe didn't say a word as she quietly listened to her parents bidding the rest of them farewell before returning home together.\nLate at night, Hazel, who had changed into a sleeping gown, walked to the balcony and stood behind a gap in the curtains. She looked towards the sewer manhole on B\u00f6klund Street.\nAs she looked at it, her face gradually turned pale as though she had recalled an experience filled with pain and horror.\nShe forced herself to retract her gaze, took two deep breaths, and turned around to walk to her bedside.\nDuring this process, she bit gently on her lip and muttered silently,That was likely a wraith... Definitely...\nI need items or charms in the Sun domain...\nWhile Hazel was looking at the manhole, Klein was also doing the same.\nIt's been days. I wonder how well that Demoness, Trissy, has recovered and whether she has left or not... Thankfully, after Hazel was given a scare by me, she hasn't dared to approach the manhole...Klein's gaze swept the iron-black street lamps as he nodded slightly.\nHe opened the iron cigar case and made his Wraith marionette appear within the full-body mirror.\nHe had already decided to send Senor down the sewers to check the area to confirm Trissy's condition. He didn't want that Demoness to cause any trouble.\nFurthermore, the sewers were just physically too close to his identity as Dwayne Dant\u00e8s. Klein didn't wish for Trissy to be in the vicinity any longer, wishing that she could recover soon and take action. That would prompt her to leave B\u00f6klund Street.\nHmm, having Admiral of Blood Senor appear every once in a while would fulfill the character setting I previously created. It doesn't live nearby, and because the sewers contains a secret, it often wanders around in search of it...As Klein was thinking, he made the marionette in the ancient triangular hat leap onto the street lamp's surface before passing through the manhole cover in a Wraith form, quickly approaching the hidden fork where Trissy hid herself at.\nBefore reaching the dead end, Senor, who had night vision, could see that the area was empty.\nShe's already recovered and left?Klein thought as he made the marionette continue forward, stopping at the spot where Trissy was previously sitting.\nHe discovered that the place was tidied up. Not only was the ground not muddy and moist, even the moss on the walls and corner had vanished.\nThere isn't any leftover food either... That fellow became a germaphobe after becoming a woman? No, perhaps he was like that to begin with...With Senor's vision, Klein surveyed the area and determined that either Trissy hadn't left, or she hadn't left for more than a day; otherwise, it was impossible to maintain the cleanliness of the place.\nJust as this thought flashed through his mind, light footsteps sounded into the Wraith's ear.\nUnder his control, Senor retraced his steps and wasn't surprised to see Trissy in her black dress.\nThis Demoness had her luscious black hair cascading down, unlike peers her age who had different hairstyles. It was simple and neat.\nMatched with her pale face that had just recovered some of its ruddiness, Trissy looked like a dreamy flower that was silently blooming in the night.\nAs expected of a Demoness... Thankfully, there's a marionette in between us; otherwise, I would just end up staring at her... Heh heh, a dead person won't be enticed! No matter how charming a Demoness is, there's no way they can make the deceased climb out of a tomb like a zombie...Klein lampooned as he looked at Trissy who had a blank expression but was secretly wary, having released the invisible threads.\n\"Where did you go?\"\nTrissy pricked up her brows and said, \"Would you like to relieve yourself where you sleep?\"\nUh... I thought a Demoness wouldn't need to use the washroom...Klein gave a self-deprecating comment and made Senor chuckle.\n\"Are you referring to pissing and shitting?\"\nHe had deliberately made the marionette say such words, as it matched Admiral of Blood's persona of a boorish pirate.\nTrissy indiscernibly frowned and said, \"Is there anything else?\"\nSenor didn't continue on the topic as he said, \"You look like you've almost recovered.\"\nTrissy smiled.\n\"Not bad. I'll be leaving tomorrow.\"\nShe paused as she slightly narrowed her slender eyes.\n\"To be frank, I doubt whether you're the real Admiral of Blood at times.\"\nOf course it's real! You should ask if he's alive or dead...With his interest piqued, Klein made Senor ask, \"Why do you say that?\"\nTrissy's gaze swept over the Wraith's face and said, \"It's said that Admiral of Blood is someone who indulges in his desires, and he has no resistance towards beautiful females and males.\n\"Yet, I don't see any sparks of desire when you face me.\n\"I believe the real Admiral of Blood would've added the condition of doing something I wouldn't want to in the agreement.\"\nKlein deliberated for two seconds and made Senor give a self-deprecating smile.\n\"I'm afraid of finding myself lost to Pleasure and ending up being controlled by you.\"\nTrissy's expression instantly changed. This was indeed one of the reasons why she had raised the topic.\nTo a Demoness of Pleasure, Beyonders who habitually indulged in their desires were natural prey.\nKlein actively ignored the topic and made the marionette say, \"You're seeking out the target tomorrow?\n\"Very clearly, the royal guard captain knows you and knows what you look like.\"\nAfter all, you were arranged by them to be by Prince Edessak's side...Klein silently added.\nTrissy lowered her head and looked at her toes before chuckling.\n\"Rest at ease, I have the perfect plan.\"\nAs she spoke, she turned her body sideways and casually looked deep into the sewers.\n\"If you set off from here, at the end of the sixth left fork is a hidden passage. It has signs of prolonged human activity. Heh heh, I discovered it while walking around in the past few days.\n\"I believe it has something to do with that girl, right...\n\"It's also the reason why you're here?\"\nHidden passage?Klein didn't confirm or deny it. He made Senor smile and say, \"Did you discover anything?\"\nTrissy shook her head.\n\"There was nothing at all. Perhaps only a certain pathway, or someone with a specific item, can find the clues.\"\nA Marauder's intuition, or something on Hazel's person?Klein didn't make Senor continue on the topic as he pressed his hand to his chest and bowed with a smile.\n\"Since you've recovered, I can be at ease.\"\nThe moment he said that, he suddenly vanished.\nTrissy focused her eyes into a stare, but it was to no avail. Only when the invisible threads she had released was hit by a breeze did she retract her gaze, confirming that Admiral of Blood had really left.\nAt that moment, Klein had brought the Wraith back to the manhole without attempting to explore the spot which Trissy had mentioned.\nThere were three reasons for his decision. First, it had exceeded a hundred meters. Second, he suspected that he wouldn't find anything since he wasn't from the Marauder pathway, nor did he have the corresponding items. Third, Trissy was still around.\n...\nFors woke up naturally on a Sunday morning as she got up to wash up. As she chewed on a fresh piece of toast, she retrieved a stack of items from her mailbox.\nAs she walked to the coffee table with a cup of coffee on it, she casually flipped through the items and discovered a reply letter she had been looking forward to.\nThrowing down the papers, bills, and other letters, Fors tore open the envelope.\n\"...Teacher is already in Backlund?\" Fors quickly read through the letter as she muttered in surprise.\nAt the same time, she saw the toast in her mouth plunge to the ground."}
{"num_chp":640,"summary":"Klein had a certain degree of curiosity towards the outcome of the exploration. He didn't ask further as he walked past the captain's cabin and walked down the stairwell.\nAfter a few seconds, he felt his throat itch. He couldn't help but raise his fist to his mouth and cough.\nKlein wasn't surprised by such a development, as it was inevitable. He had carried the Biological Poison Bottle for more than two hours last night. Only when it was late at night and his confirmation that Admiral of Stars and crew didn't have any intention of attacking him did he move the mystical item into a black suitcase. Sadly, he ended up falling sick.\nOf course, the amount of time he brought the Biological Poison Bottle with him wasn't considered long. His body wasn't in a weakened state, so his resulting illness wasn't anything serious. He just felt his tonsils swell in pain.\nCattleya, who was walking slowly behind, saw this scene, but she didn't find it a problem. Instead, she found it normal.\nIt was common knowledge for knowledgeable Beyonders that mystical items were bound to have negative side effects. Furthermore, they would learn from the seven orthodox Churches and categorize those with serious side effects which made them impossible to possess or use for prolonged time as Sealed Artifacts.\nThe reason why Cattleya had sold or exchanged many of her low- and mid-level mystical items was firstly because she wanted to better strengthen her survivability. Secondly, the various negative effects from multiple items were troubling. Often, one could avoid one but not the other. Some negative effects might even stack and synergize into something worse. Therefore, to most Beyonders, the disadvantages surpassed the advantages.\nShe discovered that Gehrman Sparrow had used mystical items, Beyonder weapons, and spirituality charms to arm himself to the teeth. While being amazed, she was already guessing at the type of negative effects he was facing. From what she saw today, it was a temporary simple illness.\nWith steady steps, Klein arrived on the deck and saw Frank Lee. He was still dressed in a white shirt and dungarees. His arm was stained with dirt as though he wasn't afraid of the cold winds that blew down at him.\n\"Good morning, Gehrman.\" Frank warmly waved his hand and said, \"Here, try my latest product. This is definitely the most welcomed item at sea!\"\nAs he said, he raised his other hand. In it was a wide and fat fish of an unknown breed.\nNo, I don't want to know what \"monster\" you have cooked up this time...Klein paused in his footsteps as he looked at him with a cold expression.\nFrank Lee didn't discover any problems with his attitude. He pulled out a dagger from his waist and stabbed the fish before slicing a hole open.\nBlood flowed out and accurately landed in a large beer cup on the deck. It didn't emit any fishy smell.\n\"Smell that? It's such an intoxicating alcoholic fragrance!\" Frank Lee half-closed his eyes as he fervently said, \"This is a fish who has red wine replacing its blood. As such, the wine contains lots of nutrients!\"\n\"...\"\nKlein realized he was at a loss for words.\nFrank looked at the surroundings sailors in excitement before saying to Gehrman Sparrow, \"Do you know what's the most troubling matter out at sea? That's when we run out of alcohol without being anywhere close to shore! As long as this kind of fish can rapidly reproduce and become the sea's primary produce, then we won't be lacking any alcohol no matter where we are. By the way, they can be categorized by species. Some will produce Lanti Proof, others Nepos, red wine, and beer. The beer needs to come from sharks or whales; otherwise, there won't be enough!\"\nIsn't the most troubling matter the lack of water? Of course, all of you can use beer to replace water most of the time because it doesn't easily spoil... Those poor fishes...Klein was pondering over a response to Frank when Cattleya came on deck. She walked past him and questioned her first mate.\n\"Is Nina done with her preparations?\"\n\"Yes, she has already finished a bottle of Nepos!\" Frank pointed at a shadow formed by the sails.\nThe so-called preparations are to drink a bottle of Nepos, a specialty of Feysac? The Nepos which can light a fire?Klein suddenly felt that Nina, the lady mentioned by the first mate, was likely someone with Feysac blood.\n\"Captain, I want a bottle of Sonia blood wine more!\" In the dark, a female figure slowly stood up and walked over.\nShe was more than 1.8 meters tall. Her blonde hair was casually tied up into a high pigtail. Her facial features weren't anything outstanding, but she had the striking traits of someone from Feysac. Her skin was fair and her eyes were dull.\nThis lady named Nina wore a black tight suit made of fish skin. The top and bottom seemed to be a one-piece, fully accentuating her stunning figure.\nSuch a style was rather sexy to begin with. Nina's breasts were also far above what was normal. It was obvious what the surrounding pirates were looking at.\nKlein felt a little embarrassed and wished to move his gaze away. However, on second thought, Gehrman Sparrow was definitely not such an untried person. All he could do was empty his gaze and look straight at Nina's face.\n\"Gehrman, this is our boatswain, Nina! She's also the navigator's assistant. Haha, her Sequence's name is Seafarer!\" Frank Lee still didn't hold back in his introductions.\nApart from his research of crossbreeding, this Poison Expert is rather simple... I now recall that this lady named Nina has a bounty of 3,600 pounds. Her nickname is Seabed Murderer. Sigh, after seeing so many bounty notices, there are some I can't immediately recall...Klein looked at Nina's eyes and nodded calmly.\n\"Good morning, Ma'am.\"\nNina held back her smile and sized up Klein.\n\"Good morning, Mr. Sparrow.\n\"I'm very curious if Vice Admiral Ailment is really as charming as the rumors say?\"\nAs a female pirate who had mixed with low- and mid-class people for extended periods of time, she was always very frank and direct towards both men and women. She didn't show any coyness. She had originally planned on asking Gehrman Sparrow if she was lacking in charm, or ask if he was the cold type which resulted in her being completely ignored or him showing any reaction. But considering how the man standing before her was a powerful guy, an adventurer who nearly successfully hunted Vice Admiral Ailment, or a lunatic who could draw his gun and shoot at any moment, she rationally held back her jesting words. She switched to asking about Vice Admiral Ailment.\n... How am I to answer you?Klein gloomily said, \"Her bounty is extremely charming.\"\nNina was taken aback, somewhat at a loss for a response to continue the conversation. Hence, she turned to look at Admiral of Stars.\n\"Captain, do we begin now?\"\nCattleya, who felt her bounty flash through her mind for some baffling reason, nodded.\n\"Begin.\"\nJust as she said that, Nina took large strides to the side of the ship. With her right hand supporting herself, she leaped into the sea, swimming downwards like a gigantic black fish.\nAt the same time, there were a few splashes. A few sailors had jumped down as well to provide her aid.\nThis... She begins at the mention of it. She didn't need any additional time to prepare... This lady has the temperament of the Church of Storms. As expected of a Beyonder from the Sailor pathway...Klein looked out the ship as he couldn't help but cough.\n\"You're sick?\" Frank Lee asked directly.\nKlein nodded slightly and said, \"A little.\"\nFrank thought for a moment. He didn't say a word as he rushed back into the cabin; his destination unknown.\nBy the side, Cattleya nudged her heavy glasses and smiled.\n\"Frank is a Poison Expert, but he's also an outstanding doctor.\"\nAs expected of someone from the Planter pathway...Klein didn't ask further as he stood there, awaiting Nina's preliminary exploration.\nSeeing the sudden silence that became somewhat awkward, Cattleya took a few steps forward and said, seemingly in passing, \"In another day, we will be leaving the whaling sea route.\"\n\"But we're at least a week from those waters?\" Klein thought before asking.\n\"That is if we follow the whaling sea route. In fact, this will lead further north and be more roundabout. I know of a secret sea route that can allow us to reach the waters you wish to go to in two to three days.\" Cattleya's gaze looked at Klein's eyes through her thick glasses, as though she wanted to tell how much he knew of the extremely dangerous waters.\nKlein considered and simply said, \"Very good. That's exactly what I want.\n\"In addition, those waters are more illusory than real.\"\nCattleya retracted her gaze in thought as she looked at the entrance to the cabin.\nFrank Lee ran over and held a green apple in his hand.\n\"This is the outcome of another one of my projects. It's a cross-breed of medicine and fruits. It makes the consumption of medicine more enjoyable!\" He beamed as he handed Klein the apple.\n... I'm afraid I'll end up even sicker after eating it...Klein glanced at Admiral of Stars and saw her nod gently. Only then did he inwardly force himself to accept the apple while appearing calm on the outside. He then bit down at the apple.\nIt had the taste of a normal apple. It just had a lot more juice, and the insides were softer.\nAfter a few bites, Klein discovered that his throat suddenly wasn't hurting. He didn't realize when he stopped coughing.\nI have to say that it's rather magical... As long as it doesn't involve animals and humans, Frank Lee is really a genius that should be taken seriously in the Church of Mother Earth. Unfortunately, he ultimately became a devil-like person... Klein looked at the Poison Expert and said frankly, \"It's healed.\"\n\"Very good.\" Frank didn't praise himself as he began casually introducing the pirates on the deck.\nAfter a while, Nina and the other supporting sailors swam up to the surface and returned to the ship.\nShe held a metallic piece that had been rotten into an identifiable state and a piece of black hardened mud that was filled with honeycombed holes. She grumbled to Cattleya, \"Captain, there's no deep-sea well!\n\"That well's mouth isn't even bigger than my breasts!\n\"Of course, it's very deep and dark. It's unknown what's hidden in it.\"\nShe gestured using her hands.\n\"Exaggeration is a common trait of pirates and adventurers.\" Cattleya nodded without using the term \"bragging.\"\nThe diameter of the well's mouth is that small?Klein puzzledly looked at the item in Nina's hand as he politely diverted his gaze from her body which had streams of water flowing down.\nCattleya's gaze moved in sync with his as she said, \"Go into the details.\""}
{"num_chp":1309,"summary":"After circling the primitive island three times, the Dawn finally made its way off into the distance which was perennially covered in storms.\nBernadette slowly retracted her gaze and fixed it on the Sage Frontlet that remained suspended in the air.\nAs a Clairvoyant, she clearly saw the opportunity to advance. She knew that she had completed the corresponding ritual, preventing a disaster that involved a higher order of power.\nHowever, the price she paid was to personally seal her father, the father she had missed and sought for more than a hundred years.\n\"How ironic...\" Bernadette looked at the vertical eye embedded with diamonds and sighed softly.\nAfter leaving Intis, she had two big wishes. First, she wanted to investigate the truth behind the matter and see if she had misunderstood her father. Second, she wanted to follow her father's footsteps and see if there was a possibility of reviving him.\nBernadette had already fulfilled her first wish. The truth was that she had indeed misunderstood her father. This curtailed her pain and conflicted feelings. Her hatred for her father had completely dissipated, but it also added to her guilt.\nWith this kind of guilt and yearning all this time, she tried her best to fulfill her second wish, but the outcome wasn't pleasant.\nIf there hadn't been any hope from the beginning, she might not have had such a huge reaction. However, she had clearly seen the light and seen her father, but she had no choice but to personally place him into a state of slumber.\nAfter a moment of silence, Bernadette's slightly unfocused eyes became clear again.\nShe no longer hesitated and no longer blamed herself. She no longer had all kinds of negative emotions. She firmly raised her right hand and drew out ancient words that shimmered with a stellar radiance in the void. She summoned the spirit world creature who was half-man, half-wind, and she retrieved the Sage supplementary ingredients from it.\nAs for the rest, as there was no need for them to be specially preserved, they were in the collection room of the Dawn.\nNot long after, Bernadette used Pale Death to shatter the Sage Frontlet. She concocted the potion that could allow her to advance to Sequence 2.\nLooking at the bubbling Sage potion with each bubble containing a transparent eye, Bernadette firmly raised her right hand and brought the glass bottle to her mouth.\nShe knew that what she needed at this moment wasn't sorrow, nor corny emotions, but determination and the will to forge forward. This was because if she wanted to help her father, Emperor Roselle, escape the corruption and completely revive, she needed a higher Sequence and greater strength.\nBecause of this, she was willing to bury the pain in the deepest part of her heart and not let it affect her mental state. It was only when there was no one around at night that she could retrieve it and savor it alone.\nWith the Sage potion entering her mouth, Bernadette's body turned illusory at a discernible pace.\nShe broke down into thick and complicated knowledge, changing into an existence that was a flux of information.\nThe entire Dawn, as well as the surrounding winds, storms, lightning, seawater, and waves, all lost their sense of reality. It was as though they had been restored to the most fundamental blocks of information.\nFor most of Sequence 3 Beyonders of the Mystery Pryer pathway, such a state was extremely dangerous. If one's willpower wasn't strong enough, their luck wasn't good enough, and they weren't prepared enough, the knowledge that they had transformed into would be infiltrated by all kinds of information within seconds. They would be washed away, assimilated, and thus quickly lose consciousness. They wouldn't be able to reassemble their bodies, turning into a very strange and difficult monster to deal with in mysticism.\nA Knowledge Demon!\nThis was also known as an Information Creature.\nBernadette had relied on the Sage Frontlet and had previously transformed into a flux of information on several occasions. Although it was limited to two to three seconds and didn't last too long, it was still considered experience. At that moment, she tried her best to maintain her consciousness and establish a connection with the information produced in the spirit world by preventing a high-level disaster.\nThe information had a clear imprint belonging to her, and it involved a very high level of power. It was exceptionally \"solid\" and couldn't be dispersed by other information for short periods of time. It helped her to stabilize her consciousness and slowly gather the dissipating flux of information around her body.\nDuring this process, Klein, who was above the gray fog, tapped the edge of the long mottled table with the help of the prayer light. He used a Miracle Invoker's ability of changing the probability of certain developments and actions to a certain extent, and he bestowed Bernadette with a certain amount of good luck.\nTime ticked by. There were several times when Bernadette wavered on the border of losing consciousness, but in the end, she managed to tide through it. She gathered all the information that belonged to her and began to reconstruct her body.\nAt that moment, she gradually felt the concern Admiral of Stars Cattleya had for her. She felt the members of the Element Dawn and her crew making their daily prayers.\nThis stabilized her condition better, allowing her to resist the ancient will that was slowly developing in her body.\nAt this moment, a series of secret information came from nowhere. Taking the opportunity while Bernadette was reforming her body, it attempted to fuse with her.\nThis was interference from the Hidden Sage!\nAs an embodiment of this world's knowledge and information, as a quasi-Sequence 0 existence of the Mystery Pryer pathway, the Hidden Sage had a certain influence on Beyonders of a lower Sequencer than \"Him.\"\nWithout giving Bernadette the chance to use the pale-white mask, the \"curtain\" draped over Klein gently rose.\nSpace-time distorted around Bernadette, completely isolating her from the outside world. Even information couldn't be interchanged.\nGrabbing this sudden moment of peace, Bernadette completely reassembled her body and used her own anchors to balance out the terrifying will that was surfacing in her body.\nAt that moment, she had truly become a \"She,\" a Sequence 2 angel of the Mystery Pryer pathway-an important figure in the mysterious world that could be addressed as a secret existence.\nRight on the heels of that, she saw the distorted space around her return to normal. She saw a series of hidden information surging towards her.\nShe stretched out her right hand and grabbed the information with ease, extracting the useful information contained within.\nJust as Bernadette was about to return to reality from the spirit world, an orange light suddenly bloomed in front of her eyes.\nThe light instantly condensed into a fat elder with a short white beard.\nThe elder smiled and said, \"Ma'am, I'm Orange Light Hilarion.\"\nOrange Light... Bernadette was puzzled. She didn't understand why Orange Light Hilarion had suddenly appeared in front of her-they hadn't interacted much before.\nAs the leader of the Element Dawn and a former Mysticologist, she wasn't unfamiliar with the Seven Lights of the spirit world. She even knew how to pray to Seven Lights, as well as the ritual needed to receive the corresponding advice. She knew that the seven lustrous lights were a symbol of the spirit world, and they contained endless knowledge of different domains. They were definitely at the angel level.\nOrange Light Hilarion added with a smile, \"A great existence wants me to inform you of the knowledge regarding the Great Old Ones, the Outer Deities, and the Cosmos, so that you have a relatively accurate grasp of the state of this world and the corresponding corruption.\"\n\"Which existence is it?\" Bernadette asked, puzzled and cautious.\nShe had vaguely guessed the answer, but she still found it quite unbelievable. After all, the Seven Lights in the spirit world were also important figures in the mysterious world. Even if a Sequence 0 true god wouldn't find it easy to get \"Them\" to do \"Their\" bidding.\nOrange Light Hilarion chuckled and replied, \"The greater ruler above the spirit world.\"\nThe great ruler above the spirit world... Bernadette repeated the honorific name, and her thoughts raced.\nHilarion glanced at her and smiled.\n\"\u2018He' also has another title:\n\"Mr. Fool.\"\n...\nSomewhere out at sea, the Future which was cruising on a safe sea route.\nCattleya suddenly jolted awake from her dream as her forehead was covered in cold sweat.\nIn the dream just now, she saw the Queen lying on the ground drenched in blood. Her chest was torn open, and a baby-like monster crawled out of it.\nAs a Mysticologist, a Mysticologist who had advanced with a drop of the Snake of Fate's blood, Cattleya believed that her dream wasn't without any reason. It was definitely a premonition.\nIt was obvious that the dream she had wasn't pleasant.\nWhile feeling uneasy, Cattleya sat up and put on her cloak. She attempted to pray to Mr. Fool, hoping that this mighty existence would give her some hints or to protect the Queen.\nSoon, a scene appeared before her eyes.\nQueen Mystic Bernadette walked out of the spirit world and returned to Dawn, allowing the ship to gradually distance itself from the nameless island.\nCattleya immediately heaved a sigh of relief and sincerely thanked Mr. Fool.\nAfter finishing her prayer, she opened the window of the captain's cabin in joy, causing starlight to condense into a long bridge that reached the deck.\nShe put on her heavy glasses and walked along the resplendent bridge of starlight to the deck where she proceeded to stroll leisurely in the quiet night.\nWhen she arrived at the bow of the ship, Cattleya saw Frank Lee tinkering with bottles.\n\"What are you doing?\" Cattleya subconsciously frowned.\nFrank looked up and said with a bright smile, \"My ideas encountered a setback so I can't proceed any further for now. I asked Nina to get me some soil from the bottom of the sea to study the microbes in it.\"\nWith that said, Frank said with a look of anticipation,\n\"When I have my next vacation, I'd like to go to the depths of the North Sea or the poles where it's a world of ice and snow. There might be many ancient microorganisms buried beneath the thick layer of ice there, from the Fourth Epoch, the Third Epoch, or even the Second and First Epoch. This will bring me plenty.\"\nYou won't have any vacations for the time being... Cattleya said inwardly.\n...\nKlein conjured a box and placed the four Cards of Blasphemy inside. After sealing them, he immediately returned to the real world and headed for the nearest Evernight cathedral.\nHe planned on informing the Evernight Goddess in the form of a prayer of the hidden dangers of the Card of Blasphemy, reminding \"Her\" to pay attention to such problems. He didn't want the Earth Mother, Lilith, to obtain the Mother card or The Moon Card."}
{"num_chp":459,"summary":"Although I have always had the urge to pray to The Fool to get rid of the psychological cue that Father Utravsky gave me, I also know, very clearly, that it's dangerous to recite the honorific name of an unknown being. Not all hidden existences will start with bait and slowly provide guidance. In such matters, \"They\" are often like sharks in the sea, who would go mad and lurch forward once they smell blood...\nBut now... Lord Nibbs, no-what does the Ancestor want?\nEmlyn White said, finding it rather ridiculous, \"It will be very, very, very dangerous.\"\nInside the black iron coffin, Nibbs Odora replied with an aged voice, \"Yes, under normal circumstances.\n\"But not all hidden existences are filled with malice. Among \u2018Them,' they will similarly abide to rules and enjoy transactions. For example, the seven pure lights of the spirit world.\n\"Since the Ancestor has given such a revelation, it means that the danger that The Fool can bring is not too serious, or even none.\n\"And during this entire process, I will always be by your side to protect you.\n\"Don't you want to get rid of the psychological cue? Have you already become a believer of Earth Mother and abandoned the moon?\"\n\"No, I haven't!\" Emlyn frantically denied.\nAfter a moment of silence, he gritted his teeth and said, \"I wish to have a few days to think it over.\"\n\"Alright, no problem. I believe that you will make a choice that suits your noble identity as a member of the Sanguine.\" Inside the coffin, Nibbs's voice turned soft as he smiled and comforted him.\nAfter sending Emlyn White back to the second floor, Cosmi Odora once again returned to the dark and gloomy underground hall, and he asked with confusion and doubt, \"Grandfather, how could the revelation given by the Ancestor involve Emlyn White? He's just a weak member of the Sanguine who only recently reached adulthood.\"\nNibbs's voice came through the thick black metal coffin lid and reverberated in the air.\n\"No, the revelation provided by the Ancestor never included Emlyn White.\n\"\u2018She' only showed a scene of the dawn of the apocalypse, depicting the erosion of the crimson moon, as well as mentioning The Fool and the corresponding honorific name.\n\"During this process, no Sanguine appeared. The mention of the key element was just my way of convincing Emlyn White.\n\"However, being able to take risks for the future of the Sanguine can also be considered a key element.\"\nCosmi was first enlightened before he had another question.\n\"Why did you choose Emlyn White? What's so special about him?\"\nNibbs Odora suddenly laughed.\n\"Hasn't he been clamoring about praying to The Fool all this time? Didn't he think that we weren't putting too much weight on his problem, that we aren't willing to antagonize Bishop Utravsky, so he was trying to find other help?\n\"I'm just fulfilling his wish.\"\nFor a long time, Cosmi was speechless.\nEmlyn White stood at the railing of the second floor, looked down at his tireless kinsmen, and nervously took a sip of his \"wine.\"\nUp to this day, I haven't heard of any terrible outcome for people who prayed to The Fool... Perhaps it's just as Lord Nibbs said, The Fool is just like the seven pure lights in the spirit world, a hidden existence that maintains order and is warm-hearted... Wait a minute, what are the seven pure lights in the spirit world? Why haven't I ever heard of them before? They seem to be on the side of good? I wonder if this will be any help to me... In short, The Fool isn't necessarily dangerous, and there is Lord Nibbs protecting me... Maybe I can take advantage of this opportunity to get rid of the psychological cue...Emlyn consoled himself with fear and anticipation.\n...\nMonday morning. Cherwood Borough, 15 Minsk Street.\nKlein squatted in front of the toilet, holding a brush and carefully cleaning the dirt inside it.\nAccording to his schedule, after completing his \"visits\" on Saturday and Sunday, he decided to take a day off and wait until tomorrow to report back to Prince Edessak about the final results and hand over the assignment. But during what should've been his relaxation time, he found the house a little too messy and dirty.\nIt was only when he saw this that he remembered that the cleaning of the house had been done twice a week through the temporary employment of the landlady's maid next door.\nAs the Sammers had gone on holiday to Seville City in Desi Bay, one of the maids had gone along with them, while another had returned to the countryside after receiving a year-end bonus. 15 Minsk Street, where he lived, hadn't been cleaned by anyone for quite some time.\nKlein had planned to put up with it for two days since he was \"leaving\" Backlund, but in his free time, he didn't dare to take the time to head to the Quelaag Club to have fun. He was afraid of infuriating Prince Edessak, so he could only stay home. Hence, seeing the things that irked him, he changed into his old clothes and began spring cleaning before the new year.\nHe went on to scrub the toilet, wash the bathtub, wipe the windows, mop the floors, clean his equipment, and wash clothes... Klein busied himself from eight to eleven before barely completing his desired cleanup.\nOf course, he only did it perfunctorily without that much attention to detail.\nSometimes, renting too big a house isn't a good thing...Klein washed his hands and wiped his face with a towel.\nWalking out of the bathroom and looking at the clean and tidy living room and dining room, and watching the sunlight pierce through the clouds and shine through the transparent glass window, showering golden spots in his house, he had a strange sense of accomplishment. He felt a lot happier.\nTime to reward myself for lunch. I'll find a good restaurant...Klein returned to the second floor and changed his clothes.\nAs he leafed through the papers, waiting for lunchtime, the doorbell rang.\n\"It's almost the new year, and there are still people coming to entrust me with missions?\" As he rose and walked to the door, Klein made up his mind to decline.\nAlthough he only had 34 pounds left in cash, in order to get out of the royal strife, he had to \"go on vacation\" to the south as soon as possible. He could no longer accept assignments.\nTo his surprise, the visitor wasn't a stranger, but the old butler of Prince Edessak.\nThe old butler was wearing a well-cut tuxedo. He saluted without losing his dignity, and said, \"Detective Moriarty, His Highness, the Prince, is waiting for you in the carriage at the end of the street. He wishes to know the progress of your investigations.\"\nSo impatient? Alright, that saves me the trouble of going all the way to Red Rose Manor tomorrow...Klein quickly reorganized what he had thought of last night and calmly replied, \"Alright.\"\nHe was about to remove his hat from the coat rack when he felt a sudden ache in his stomach, a pain that required him to visit the toilet.\nAfter enduring for a while, he realized that he couldn't hold it in any longer and apologetically said to the old butler, \"I'm very sorry. I'll need to use the bathroom first. My stomach isn't feeling well.\"\nThe old butler didn't show any abnormal expression.\n\"That's your freedom.\"\nAs he discharged one wave after another of bliss, clearing away the remnants in his stomach, Klein washed his hands and returned to the hall.\nAt that moment, he noticed that the old butler was no longer around. The one waiting outside was the maid with curly brown hair.\n\"His Highness requested me to apologize to you; he still has matters to attend to and cannot wait for too long. Please go to Red Rose Manor tomorrow or the afternoon of the day after tomorrow.\" The maid bowed meticulously.\nIt hasn't even been ten minutes, and I'd already done it as fast as I could... Usually, I can continue on for quite a while if I have newspapers...Klein smiled.\n\"No problem.\"\nAfter receiving a response, the maid who had completed her mission immediately felt a weight off her chest. She giggled and said, \"Detective Moriarty, you missed that lady again.\"\n\"Huh?\" Klein was at a loss.\nThe maid lowered her voice and said, \"This time, the young lady came with His Highness. She was the one who suggested taking a detour to meet you.\"\nIn the end, I missed her because of my stomachache? Something isn't right...Klein frowned slightly.\n...\nIn a room padded with a thick and soft carpet.\nA quill that was being held came to a pause and stopped writing.\nIn the open notebook beneath it, there were lines of text and marks of scribbled out text:\n(Scribbles)\n\"Target attempted to escape control, but unfortunately, Detective Sherlock Moriarty leaves before she heads downstairs.\"\n...\n\"The target influenced the surrounding maids, but Prince Edessak's butler, Funkel, chanced upon the problem and dealt with it.\"\n...\n(Scribbles)\n\"The target went off track once again. She participated in Talim's funeral on behalf of Prince Edessak. However, having quickly recovered to her normal state, she realized that she was unable to identify Sherlock Moriarty, and she could only let a chance slip.\"\n...\n\"Sherlock Moriarty went to Red Rose Manor to investigate, but the timing wasn't right, and the target happened to be riding horses on the golf course.\"\n...\n(Scribbles)\n\"The target, once again, triumphed over the arrangement, encouraging Prince Edessak to visit Detective Sherlock Moriarty. Unfortunately, Sherlock Moriarty happened to have a stomachache, ended up staying in the bathroom for seven minutes and forty-five seconds, and the Prince couldn't afford to wait.\"\n...\nHis facial features were like a sculpture, but the middle-aged man who was blinded in one eye put down his quill and looked at a woman.\n\"What exactly did you put on her body? Breaking through the restrictions time and time again will create big problems.\"\nThe woman laughed in a low voice and said, \"It was just an accident. Don't worry, there won't be any problems.\"\nAs she spoke, she pulled back her hair, revealing her long, white neck.\nAfter that, she slowly applied various things to her face, making her look even more alluring.\nSeeing that she was putting on her clothes and accessories, the dark golden-haired middle-aged man frowned and asked, \"Where are you going?\"\nThe woman didn't directly answer and said with a smile, \"Be careful of the quill in your hand, you almost exchanged bodies with someone the last time.\"\n\"You don't need to remind me,\" the middle-aged man with deep blue eyes to the point of being black said with a straight face.\nThe woman tightened her belt to make herself look thinner, then she lazily stretched and yawned while covering her mouth.\n\"I'm going to pay a visit to Mr. A of the Aurora Order.\n\"I hope he's as crazy as the rumors say.\"\nAs she spoke, the expression of the blind middle-aged man suddenly sank. It was because that ordinary quill had begun to write on its own, as though an invisible hand was holding onto it."}
{"num_chp":1137,"summary":"On a barren island in the Berserk Sea.\nThis place wasn't far from the Southern Continent, but it didn't belong there geographically. The reason why Klein had chosen this island as a place for himself to advance to Scholar of Yore was, firstly, because he wanted to avoid Amon and Zaratul to the best of his ability. He also didn't want to enter the region where the Mother Tree of Desire had a wide range of influence. Secondly, because the Berserk Sea was enveloped by the power left behind by Death, this was, in a way, a part of the Evernight Goddess's kingdom. If the ritual were to create a huge commotion, it was possible for some effective screening.\nFurthermore, this place is very desolate. There aren't many creatures here, so there's no need to worry about any accidents affecting the innocent... Klein surveyed the area and began to set up a ritual. He brought the corresponding materials back from above the gray fog to the real world.\nFollowing that, he flipped through the thick ancient history documents and pulled out some records that he couldn't be certain of. Those that couldn't be confirmed with divination were also removed.\nPa!\nWith a shake of his hand, the scarlet flames rose and devoured the stack of paper.\nThe supplementary ingredients needed for the Scholar of Yore potion were a large amount of real ancient historical records. Therefore, he didn't want to take the risk of using things he couldn't be sure of. He would rather have fewer of them.\nAfter making his selection, he poured the Hound of Fulgrim's blood into a huge cauldron and placed the few White Frost Crystals that he had weighed beforehand into it.\nThe moment the two supplementary ingredients came into contact with each other, a thin mist immediately rose up. It enveloped the container and was about half the height of a person and an arm wide.\nWith a glance, Klein followed his spiritual intuition and temporarily gave up on adding the last supplementary material. He first got his marionette, Enuni, to grab the Demonic Wolf of Fog's transformed heart and threw the item that seemed condensed from white mist into the cauldron.\nAs white frost condensed across Enuni's arm, the mist that emanated from the vessel became extremely dense. It began to contract and expand, as though it was alive, like a slowly-beating heart.\nWithout any hesitation, Klein controlled his marionette, Enuni, to pick up the pair of eyes from the Hounds of Fulgrim. He stuffed the two dark red flame-like objects into the seemingly corporeal mist.\nThe mist's color quickly darkened, making it impossible for him to see the huge cauldron at its core.\nHe didn't panic. Instead, he calmly got his other marionette to throw page after page of the ancient historical records into the blob of thick, dark mist.\nThe thick mist slowly collapsed. After \"digesting\" the historical records, it finally fell back into the cauldron, like water vapor, turning into something that coexisted as both a liquid and a gas. Its color was dark red, almost the size of a baby's head.\nUpon seeing this scene, Klein removed the spirit pendulum from his left wrist and used divination to determine if the potion was successfully concocted.\nHe received a revelation that it was rather dangerous, but one that he could barely withstand.\nAnd this meant that the potion was successfully concocted.\nEven if it were strictly concocted according to the formula, a Sequence 3 potion is equivalent to poison. If I can withstand it, I'll advance. Otherwise, I'll go crazy, lose control, or even die... After staring at the topaz pendant spinning rapidly in a counterclockwise direction for a few seconds, he pulled up the silver chain and wrapped it around his left wrist.\nHe cast his gaze at the potion floating in the cauldron as thoughts flashed across his mind:\nA Bizarro Sorcerer's acting not only has the key terms of \"fear,\" \"horror,\" \"directing,\" and \"inexplicable,\" there's also some level of mystery, unknown, complicated, and unpredictable aspects of fate. The two aspects combine to form a complete Bizarro Sorcerer... This is a behavioral style, while the other is the attributes...\nAnd to me, my origins are such a mystery that I haven't even figured out the truth. I've experienced so many complicated matters that I've already stopped a true god from descending, scared a King of Angels. Even my fate is so unpredictable that a Snake of Mercury is unable to discern. Therefore, I've already acted in advance and naturally digested that portion of the potion. There's no need to summarize the principles...\nThis truly reflects the single word \"bizarro\"...\nYes, the ritual requirements for Scholar of Yore requires me to be completely separated from reality for at least 300 years. Only after I become history and no longer belong to the present era do I consume the potion. My life while I was sealed within a cocoon and hung above the gray fog is more than enough. But after becoming Klein, I've experienced too many things in the past year. I've already left a mark in the present era. Would it affect the effects of the ritual?\nIt should be... Fortunately, it hasn't even been two years. The mark won't be too deep and can barely be accepted. After all, it's impossible for me to hang myself up for 300 years again before I consume the potion... There's another decade or so until the apocalypse!\nFurthermore, the ancient history I grasp is definitely far superior to any Bizarro Sorcerer. It can be considered as me effectively acting ahead of time. I can definitely avoid many dangers...\nAs his thoughts raced, Klein took a deep breath and stopped thinking about it.\nWearing a silk top hat and a double-breasted coat, his skin suddenly turned transparent as maggots that contained three-dimensional symbols crawled out.\nThe transparent maggots were itching to move, as if they were going to crawl into the dense mist in the cauldron, leaving behind only empty clothes and hats.\nKlein managed to barely control his state as he calmly extended his right hand and picked up the potion that was wrapped in mist.\nThe potion didn't seem to have any weight as it floated in front of his face.\nKlein opened his mouth and took a deep breath.\nThe potion instantly transformed and extended into Klein's mouth, making him feel like he was devouring a dark red glow.\nThe transparent maggots swarmed back into his body, tearing down the parts of the potion and swallowing them.\nAs his Mythical Creature form was special-both a full body and also separated into many small parts-Klein could only consume the potion in such a manner.\nOf course, if he could control his incomplete Mythical Creature form, it would be much simpler.\nWithout a sound, he felt a cold feeling spread through every Worm of Spirit, with a searing pain.\nA familiar, boundless grayish-white fog appeared in front of him. It enveloped the entire world, revealing some of his past experiences.\nThis included the terrifying legends he created, his conversation with the Red Angel evil spirit; the treatment of the demigod, Lucca, with the help of Miss Justice; hunting Hvin Rambis; dealing with Amon's avatars; revenge on Ince Zangwill; exploring Calder\u00f3n City; infiltrating Saint Samuel Cathedral; dominating the seas; stopping the True Creator's descent; saving Tingen; and various other details of his daily life.\nThey made conflicts with different people and things, becoming extremely complicated as they merged into a sea. As he \"flew\" through it, he was unable to find a clear and accurate sense of self. He felt like he was about to be lost in this area. The cold, burning pain constantly drove him forward, so as to expel the influence on him. This made it difficult to return to the real world.\nWith great difficulty, Klein managed to control this feeling. As he gradually lost consciousness and his body slowly descended, he tried his best to find something that could confirm his identity.\nFinally, he saw the deep depths of the gray fog. At the end of the sea was a shattered spot of light. With a thought, he followed his intuition and flew over in a manner that seemed to travel the cosmos.\nThere was a figure hanging from the blurry door of light in the spot of light. He was stored in a transparent cocoon as he swayed gently. He looked like the original Zhou Mingrui. This had nothing to do with his surroundings. He was alone and easily grasped.\nI couldn't see this before when I used the Yesterday Once More charm, but I can actually do so now... In other words, during the advancement process, I can indirectly influence the Sefirah Castle above the gray fog? Wait, my ability to think has been restored... Klein's consciousness instantly cleared up as he finally understood the essence of the ritual.\nBy eliminating the interference, he could provide a clear definition of himself to become a Scholar of Yore. This prevented him from getting lost!\nFollowing a similar spot of light, Klein began to fly deeper into the grayish-white fog. Along the way, he discovered that the surrounding fog was scattered with fragments of light. They had colonial phases, times when Roselle ruled, the Battle of the Violated Oath, the White Rose War, the Twenty Year War... These were all bits of history that Klein knew of the Fifth Epoch.\nAs he passed through them, he naturally split his consciousness and completed an invisible connection, making his definition of his own identity even clearer.\nIn the Pale Era, during the War of the Four Emperors, the Trunsoest Empire, the Tudor Dynasty, the United Empire, Solomon's first and second Empire, the fall of Red Angel, the Blood Emperor's apotheosis, the Black Emperor's return, and other historical fragments continued to surface as Klein kept rushing forward. They appeared in different spots in the endless gray fog, like the stars in the night sky, they illuminated the path to return.\nIn such a manner, Klein felt that he was becoming more and more lucid. Every Worm of Spirit's coldness and burning sensation became milder.\nHe could've turned around a long time ago and returned to the real world. However, he didn't stop and continued flying forward.\nScenes of the fatal attack of the Rose Redemption; the three great angels, White, Storm, Wisdom sharing in the body of the ancient sun god; and the plotting in the Giant King's Court with the Church of Evernight, Earth, and Combat hiding as secret organizations flashed across the grayish-white fog. The more he proceeded forward, the more relaxed he felt. He felt like he was about to fly up from running down a runway.\nAt some point in time, a group of terrifying canine-like creatures with dark red eye sockets appeared beside him. They ran around the indiscernible bottom of the gray fog as they followed him by his side as if they were accompanying and guarding him.\nAmong them, two of them only had one eye.\nKlein looked around and smiled. He didn't stop and continued proceeding deeper into the gray fog.\nThe history of the Dual Era and the Early Era of Fire swept past him from behind, pointing out the path that led forward. Finally, Klein stopped in front of a lonely fragment of light. Inside was a withered forest and a normal-sized tomb.\nHe went forward and saw that the grayish-white fog was silently enveloping everything. It was unknown where the other fragments of light were floating.\nFeeling his spirituality depleting, Klein didn't continue the search. He connected his consciousness to his origin, and he suddenly plummeted.\nAs the gray fog rapidly faded away, Klein felt his body and saw the cauldron in front of him.\nHe didn't care about his current state, and he subconsciously looked up into the sky.\nHe directly saw the gray fog and the ancient majestic palace above the gray fog.\nThe mysterious space was trembling slightly.\n...\nIn Backlund, a postman who was riding a bicycle stopped. He turned his head slightly and adjusted the monocle on his right eye.\nHe then muttered to himself, \"Sefirah Castle...\"\nAfter a few seconds of hesitation, the thin-faced young man curled his lips and laughed. His expression was filled with anticipation.\nIn a rental apartment at East Borough of the same city, figures hanging in the air swayed gently. At the same time, they simultaneously made a sound:\n\"Sefirah Castle...\"\nIn the basement of Saint Samuel Cathedral, Leonard Mitchell, who was assigning missions to his team, suddenly heard an elderly voice in his mind:\n\"Sefirah Castle...\""}
{"num_chp":246,"summary":"Aaron and Talim left the Quelaag Club after they separately completed the nomination form. It wasn't a weekend; the former had two more operations in the afternoon, and the latter had to teach Viscount Conrad's youngest son horse-riding. The teenager needed to ensure that he didn't embarrass himself during the Backlund social events in the second half of the year.\nKlein watched the manservant dressed in a red vest and a maid in a beautiful dress come and go a few times before finally delivering him his own proof of membership and a badge with the symbol of the Frost constellation engraved on it.\n\"An entry fee of 50 pounds. There are still three and a half months left this year, with an annual fee of 4 pounds a year.\" The manservant in the red vest pushed the two objects to Klein.\nKlein took out the 57 pounds which Mary Gale had given him and handed him 54 pounds.\nThe amount beyond the entry fee and annual fee was Mary's first payment. She was very pleased with how quickly Klein obtained information on Doragu Gale's mistress, as well as her photo.\n50 pounds membership... Madam Mary is such a generous lady!While Klein watched the manservant and the maid verify the money and confirm the exact amount, he recalled Stelyn Sammer's private introduction.\nMary's father was a co-founder of the Coim Company and had a 20 percent stake. It was originally just a small company that barely made money, but as Backlund's pollution worsened and the demand for anthracite and charcoal increased, the company rapidly expanded to become one of the top ten companies in the capital's industry. As such, Mary's net worth skyrocketed.\nThe only problem was that when she was married to Doragu Gale, the company was still quite an unknown company. Her father hadn't paid much attention to using the shares as her dowry and didn't proceed with any protection of estate gifting and had instead used the more popular \"willing of gifts.\"\nThe former referred to the dowry as an independent and separate estate of the woman and not subjected to her husband's control. Even the right-of-use depended on the woman, while the latter assigned the dowry's ownership to the entire family. However, the husband had to immediately make a valid will to promise that if he passed away before his partner, the split of the estate would be two to four times the rights and interests of the dowry received. After which, the rest would proceed according to the normal inheritance laws which could effectively guarantee the livelihood of the widow.\nIf Mary initiated a divorce before she could get evidence of Doragu's adultery, the Coim Company shares would be divided equally between both parties.\nKlein remembered Stelyn saying enviously, \"The current value of those shares is currently close to 20,000 gold pounds. Adding the other property in their name, Mary is a truly wealthy lady. Once she's divorced, she will definitely become the target of many men in Backlund, including some nobles.\"\nThat's only enough money for Miss Justice to assassinate Ambassador Bakerland twice...Klein suddenly thought about that when he saw the red-vested manservant and the good-looking maid bow at him.\n\"Mr. Moriarty, welcome to the Quelaag Club.\"\nUpon hearing this, Klein picked up the proof of membership and the Frost badge.\nThe former was made of elastic paper which looked like a card with Klein's name and his membership start date on it.\nAfter applying an imprint of his index finger, the proof of membership was officially ready for use.\nThe latter was the Quelaag Club's distinctive badge, named for its founding in early November, which corresponded to the month of the Frost constellation. The symbol and the number 192 were printed on the front, followed by \"Sherlock Moriarty\" imprinted on the back.\n\"The club now has 192 members?\" Klein asked casually.\n\"Yes, our club doesn't accept people without a recommendation.\" The red-vested manservant beamed and introduced, \"On the first floor, there's a buffet cafeteria, bar, library, squash room, conference room, and card room. You can use them all for free. The food and wine are free for your sampling as well. There are 16 lounge rooms and two small conference rooms on the second floor. They are also free, and can be used as long as they aren't occupied...\"\nThe good-looking maid pointed to the rear and said, \"There are two tennis courts on the lawn, totally free of charge. There are two shooting ranges underground, and you only need to pay the corresponding rental fee of the equipment.\n\"If you aren't satisfied with the simple buffet, you can order ala-carte. We have an exclusive chef, and you just need to pay for the ingredients.\"\nBoard, lodging, and entertainment are all provided for... As expected of a high-end club...Klein sincerely thanked Mrs. Mary.\nHe smiled warmly and said, \"Send someone to show me around so that I can familiarize myself with the environment. Afterward, give me a lounge to take an afternoon nap.\"\n\"Alright.\" The red manservant made an inviting gesture.\nAfter familiarizing himself with the Quelaag Club's environment, Klein entered a lounge and carefully studied the layout of the place. He discovered it was similar to a hotel room of the later generation. It was said to be decorated in the Intis-style.\nI have to consider how to obtain evidence of Doragu's affair tomorrow. It's simply impossible to hide the flash of the camera... In other words, I only have one shot at taking a picture... And if I do that, I'll definitely be kicked out of the club... I have to think of a safe way... I'll read through the papers later and try to determine the progress regarding Ian's case through the news. From there, I can determine which three days I should be guarded...Klein paced back and forth, lost in thought.\nAt that moment, his heart suddenly palpitated as he tensed up.\nIs this the premonition of a Clown? However, there are no scenes in my mind...Klein felt the air around him turn still like it was the calm before the storm.\nSoon, this feeling disappeared, as if nothing had happened.\nCould it be that danger is approaching? But nothing like this happened when I was attacked by Meursault...Puzzled, Klein pulled out a coin and divined if he would be attacked in the next few days.\nThe answer was negative.\nAfter thinking for a few seconds, Klein drew the curtains and pretended to take an afternoon nap. He took four steps counterclockwise and went above the gray fog.\nHe sat down and pondered for a long time before muttering to himself, \"I will be in grave danger in the next few days.\"\n...\nAfter repeating the statement, he flicked the coin again and saw the copper-colored object tumble down and land in his open palm.\nThis time, the portrait of the king was facing up!\nIt meant a positive result!\nMy reaction just now really was an omen that danger is coming...Klein narrowed his eyes and leaned back in his chair.\nHe was rather puzzled by this matter.\nWhether it was as a Seer or Clown, they had never displayed such abilities before. Even if they could predict danger, it was because the target was right in front of him or beside him!\nThere was nobody around me... From the fact that my divination was misled, it must have involved a relatively higher Sequencer, most likely Bakerland's assistant... In the end, it actually gave me a premonition? This isn't scientific, uh-this isn't mystic... There must be something else behind it, but I can't be certain why yet...Klein looked around and saw the boundless fog, crimson and still, the palace standing as it had always stood.\nHe reined in his doubts and temporarily stopped thinking about the reason. Instead, he focused his attention on the attack that was about to occur...\nAfter several more divinations, Klein found that he could only confirm that there would be great danger in the next few days. It couldn't be shortened to three days, two days, or even five hours.\nIn other words, he could only obtain a somewhat vague revelation.\nAnd in a dream divination, he saw Ian dressed in his old coat, standing in the street with the elegant gas lamps and the blurry crimson moon behind him.\nOther than this image, there was nothing else.\n\"How should I interpret this?\" Klein thought for a moment. He could only assume that this was the prelude to danger.\nWithout further delay, he returned to the real world, left the Quelaag Club, and went to the nearby Hillston branch of the Backlund Bank to withdraw the remaining hundred pounds from his account-the sum of 1000 pounds from Justice hasn't been cleared yet and reconciled. Without the corresponding information sent to the branches, the account wasn't synchronized, and, theoretically speaking, there was a loophole. Klein could withdraw 100 pounds from another branch and seize the opportunity when all the accounts were out of sync.\nHowever, this was only in theory. In order to avoid similar acts, the banks had many rules on anonymous accounts. First, it was to enhance the transmission of similar information in the same city; second, it was to limit a single withdrawal to no more than 500 pounds, and third, if the last withdrawal wasn't done locally, a telegram was needed to inquire about it, and today, Klein encountered the third situation.\nPutting away the money, he took a horse carriage to the Backlund Bridge area and entered the Bravehearts Bar.\nUnder Kaspars's guidance, he saw Maric sitting in the card room. He wasn't surrounded by zombies.\nKlein discarded the idea of using his spirituality to wrap Azik's copper whistle, slapped a 100 pounds on the table, and said to the pale Maric, \"I agree to the deal.\n\"I'll pay an advance of 100 pounds. I'll pay another 300 pounds every additional day I'm protected.\n\"The protection begins now!\"\nMaric's gaze fell past him and landed somewhere behind him. He nodded and said, \"Alright, she has agreed.\"\nAh?Klein turned back in surprise only to see the wall and nothing but air.\nHe secretly activated his Spirit Vision, he but failed to discover anything.\nMaric stuffed the 100 pounds into his pocket and said indifferently, \"You can return now. She has begun protecting you, in a hidden way.\"\nIf I hadn't divined this beforehand, I would definitely think of all of you as cheats...Klein surveyed his surroundings and deliberately acted as though he left with clenched teeth.\nAlong the way, he would occasionally activate and deactivate his Spirit Vision, constantly observing the outside through the carriage windows, but he didn't find his so-called bodyguard.\nBack at 15 Minsk Street, Klein closed the door, went into the bathroom, turned on the tap, and washed his hands.\nThe sound of water splashing disappeared as he shook off the water droplets and wiped his palms with a towel. Then, he raised his head to look at himself in the mirror to inspect his appearance.\nAt this moment, he saw himself phasing away in the mirror before transforming into a woman wearing a black regal dress.\nThe woman had light golden hair and blue eyes. She looked very delicate but her face was abnormally pale.\nShe wore a small black bonnet, lifted her skirt, and bowed at Klein.\nThis...Without hiding his surprise, Klein took a few steps back and leaned against the wall.\nOnly then did he realize that this might be the bodyguard he had hired for 1000 pounds.\nThe image in the mirror quickly dimmed and Klein saw himself again. Everything had been restored back to normal."}
{"num_chp":1146,"summary":"As she passed through the illusory door, Trissy hid herself and jumped down from the cliff at the entrance, towards the dark valley below.\nThe secret mausoleum that originated from Blood Emperor Tudor was hidden here.\nDuring the descent, Trissy's body was as light as a feather. She lost most of her weight, but her speed was in no way slow.\nNone of the remaining guards noticed that she had sneaked in.\nJust as Trissy was approaching her target, she heard a voice say, \"Concealment is prohibited here.\"\nTrissy's figure instantly appeared out of nowhere. And in the area above the towering mausoleum in the dark valley, there was a man who had appeared at some point in time.\nThis man had a long, rectangular face with a white hairband on his head. He had a mustache that curled up around his mouth, and his brows were extremely thick, setting off his relatively large eyes.\nHe was dressed in formal attire and wore a cloak. The tips of his shoes were extremely long, and his attire didn't seem to match the times. He was the demigod who supported George III, Prince Grove.\nOn the head of this Sequence 3 Chaos Hunter, there was a crown made of thorns. Pure light constantly gathered into the crown, interweaving into a \"sea.\"\nSealed Artifact 0-36.\n...\nKlein swam beneath the Tussock River when an image suddenly appeared in his mind just as he led his marionette, Qonas and Enuni, through the illusory door.\nA black cathedral stood in front of them with its spacious door opened, revealing a man in a pair of dungarees, a gentleman in a formal suit and top hat, a lady with frilly designs along her sleeves, and a lady whose dress formed flowers with laces...\nThey were suspended in midair, motionless.\n\"Caw!\" \"Caw!\" \"Caw!\"\nBlack ravens circled the top of the cathedral, letting out heart-stopping cries.\nWithout making any guesses, Klein felt like he had fallen into a crack on a frozen lake. His body turned cold as his hair stood on end.\nCountless thoughts surged in his mind as they collectively shouted out a name:\nZaratul!\nIn the blink of an eye, Klein instinctively made a decision. He planned to switch locations with his marionettes from the outside world, and directly leave the \"cathedral\" in front of him.\nClearly,. he had encountered a \"miracle.\" He didn't enter George III's secret mausoleum after passing through the illusory door; instead, he had come to a baffling place.\nIn the next second, he discovered that the Spirit Body Threads that were connected to his marionettes had been severed. They were rapidly floating upwards towards the interior of the pitch-black cathedral.\nIf it wasn't for his intuition that exceeded his own level, allowing him to detect danger ahead of time, he definitely wouldn't have been able to react in time. He definitely would've been hung up and become a member of the marionettes.\nHe didn't have time to think too much about it. He quickly controlled his Spirit Body Threads and collected them all, connecting them to himself, forming one \"circle\" after another.\nThis allowed him to temporarily extricate himself from the danger, but it also made him lose his marionettes, Qonas, and Enuni, in just a second.\nThe two marionettes' necks suddenly tightened as they were lifted up by an invisible hand before being hung up in the cathedral's interior.\nTogether with the original corpses, they swayed in the wind and produced voices that were different but said the exact same thing:\n\"Welcome back...\"\n...\nIn Memorial Square, the \"imagined\" King George III was still giving a speech.\n\"...I will further lower the wealth requirements needed for election eligibility. I will hand over even more rights to the House of Commons...\"\nAlthough the people didn't understand why there was such a development in the speech, it sounded good to them.\nThese are all bills that have been approved by the House of Lords, but there's no need to tell the public during this speech... It's like the King is emphasizing that he will definitely follow these bills in the future... Audrey was puzzled, but she couldn't come up with a convincing explanation.\nIn the dark and majestic secret Ruins No. 1 in the outskirts of Backlund.\nThe real George III had already worn a black crown and consumed the potion.\n\"His\" body was transforming towards the shadow of order, extending in a magical state. As for the nine mausoleums, they were the islands in the sea of nothingness. They were the components of his entire rule. As for the people who were chanting \"Emperor George III\" at the same time during the ritual, there were like countless numbers of lighthouses. Together, they \"anchored\" this ruler of Loen, East Balam, and the Rorsted Archipelago, making \"Him\" completely transcend reality and become a part of the shadow of order.\nDuring this process, George III's thoughts wandered uncontrollably as though they were being torn apart:\nThe Secret Order's Zaratul actually contacted me directly, hoping to provide me with help...\n\"He\" said that \"He\" saw some of Gehrman Sparrow's thoughts from the Capim case, the attack on Ailment Maiden, the silencing of Crazy Captain, and Qonas Kilgor's disappearance. And \"His\" divination results made \"Him\" cooperate with me, offering to help me guard a mausoleum. There, \"He\" waited for Gehrman Sparrow to take the initiative to walk to \"Him,\" because of his own goals and the law of convergence of Beyonder characteristics...\n\"He\" also said that the most important thing to do when dealing with a qualified demigod of the Seer pathway is to be patient and determined...\nWhat a charlatan...\n\"He\" even brought Abomination Suah...\nI used my powers to sign a contract with \"Them\"...\nTogether with the helpers I invited from the Twilight Hermit Order, as well as Grove, who wields a Grade 0 Sealed Artifact, even if most of the demigods of the military and royal family are fighting at the front lines or protecting Backlund, I don't have to worry about the ritual being destroyed. Unless a true deity descends into the real world...\nAnd that's impossible... So, I originally wanted to use this opportunity to lure out any resistance, but in the end, I decided to use this opportunity to directly advance...\nHeh heh, since Grove still doesn't know about these hidden cards. Well, he has no right to know...\nIn less than two minutes, I'll become an eternal god, the Black Emperor who rules over reality...\n...\n\"Caw!\" \"Caw!\" \"Caw!\"\nIn the dark world with the ravens' cawing, the corpses hanging from the black top of the church descended and passed through the main door.\nTheir eyes were locked onto Klein, who was outside.\nAlmost at the same time, a figure slowly but firmly outlined itself in midair.\nWithout caring about what it was, Klein quickly snapped his fingers while maintaining the special state of his Spirit Body Threads.\nPa!\nA red flame surged out from his wallet and instantly enveloped him.\nThe flame was quickly extinguished, and Klein remained where he was, unable to leap out.\nHe didn't show any signs of being depressed as he immediately activated Creeping Hunger to attempt to teleport.\nKlein instantly turned transparent as he appeared again, unable to take a single step.\nHis origin and destination had strangely been connected.\nAt that moment, the figure in midair had already taken form. He was dressed in gorgeous clothes, with long chestnut-colored curly hair, blue eyes, high nose bridge, and thin lips. He was none other than the Roselle Gustav from when he was an emperor.\n\"He\" looked down at Klein as countless illusory symbols appeared in his eyes.\nKlein's mind instantly swelled as he was injected with a large amount of unknown knowledge.\nHis head felt like it was exploding in an instant while his other thoughts were completely occupied, so much so that he couldn't even lift a finger.\nInstinctively, he allowed that knowledge to split up and become injected into hundreds of Worms of Spirit.\nThis allowed him to regain his ability to control his body as he quickly grabbed the space ahead of him with his right hand.\nHis arm suddenly sank, and then he suddenly pulled back. When the marionettes passed through the cathedral's door and began their attacks, another two figures appeared in midair, dragging out a scaleless, silvery-white tail.\nAs he released his right hand, a giant serpent appeared in this dark kingdom.\n\"His\" eyes were bright red and cold, and his body was covered in patterns and symbols. There were countless wheels in the details.\nSnake of Fate!\nActually, this wasn't something that Klein could summon out from the Historical Void. Instead, it was Will Auceptin descending with the burning of the paper crane after using the Yesterday Once More charm.\nKlein had just used Flaming Jump moments ago to seek help from the Snake of Fate.\nAnd the reason why he wanted to \"grab\" at something was to conceal his true intentions. It was to prevent the opposing angel from discovering the location of the Snake of Fate, putting Dr. Aaron's family in danger.\nThis wasn't like how he had previously dealt with Amon's avatar back then, as he had no confidence in eliminating all the clues. Therefore, he had discussed with Will in advance on how to deal with such situations.\nFortunately, the intent Will Auceptin expressed indicated that the truth of the \"summoning\" from before hadn't been exposed.\nAt that moment, the gigantic Snake of Mercury rose up and bit its tail, turning into a mysterious and exaggerated wheel.\nIn midair, two figures appeared on both sides of Roselle's projection. One of them was Queen Mystic Bernadette, whose real body was in an intense battle with Sequence 1 Hand of Order William Augustus I. The other was formed from pure light, and a pair of shining wings grew on his back. It was obviously at the level of an angel!\nSuddenly, the two angel projections that appeared quickly vanished. The attacks they directed at Klein, and the controlled marionettes, retreated back into the cathedral and were hung up again.\nQonas and Enuni walked out one after another. With him, they passed backward through the illusory door and left the world with resonating cawing, appearing beneath the Tussock River.\nSnake of Fate. Reboot!\nThe giant serpent's figure vanished as well. Without any hesitation, Klein activated \"Teleportation\" and passed through countless spirit world creatures to another secret mausoleum. He used the remaining blood to outline the symbol and opened the illusory door.\nThis time, he entered the interior and saw a solemn and dark mausoleum. He summoned the Sea God Scepter and released a terrifying \"Lightning Storm,\" again and again, destroying the target.\nThen, he turned around and left the scene.\nEverything went so smoothly, just like a dream.\nYes, a beautiful dream.\nKlein, who could always maintain his lucidity in dreams, had realized that he was in a real dream created by someone else the moment he entered the ruins where the secret mausoleum was!"}
{"num_chp":340,"summary":"A-aren't you making things difficult for me?Upon hearing Aaron's request, Klein almost drew the crimson moon on his chest, but he ultimately resisted the urge and replied very seriously, \"Perhaps there's something about my behavior that has led you to misunderstand.\n\"But I have to tell you that faith is something that cannot be changed after it's decided upon.\"\nAaron immediately raised his arms and made an apologetic gesture.\n\"I'm sorry that I misunderstood your faithfulness. I shouldn't have taken your faith as a joke.\n\"Alright, our differences in faith do not prevent us from becoming friends.\"\nKlein wiped away the fake expression he put on and smiled.\n\"That's not true in Feysac and Feynapotter. They can only accept one faith.\"\nIn comparison, with so many Churches coexisting for more than fourteen hundred years, Loen and Intis are much more open in this respect.\nBefore Aaron could answer, he casually changed the subject.\n\"Did you see Will Auceptin again? I'm referring to the kid that had one of his legs amputated, the one who said that your luck would turn for the worse.\"\nHe was certain that the Nighthawks would follow the clues provided by Aaron, so he wondered what the outcome was. He was curious if the child who changed Aaron's luck still had the tarot card in his possession.\n\"No, I haven't seen him since he left the hospital.\" Aaron shook his head firmly.\nWhat a pity. The Nighthawks can find his address according to the hospital's records, and it's not convenient for me to be involved... Of course, the child might've moved away long ago.After a brief exchange with Aaron, Klein decided to head for the underground shooting range, familiarizing himself with his free revolver with ordinary bullets.\nAt this moment, two more acquaintances came in. One was a member of the National Atmospheric Pollution Council, Coim Company shareholder, Ma'am Mary, and the other was Klein's landlord, Stelyn Sammer. They were all wearing relatively light skirts, making them look much younger.\nAccording to the rules of the club, each member could only bring in one additional person; therefore, Mary's maid and her bodyguard were left in the reception hall.\nKlein politely greeted them and praised them out of courtesy, \"Ladies, you two are as beautiful as ever today, and yet there is a beauty that's different from your usual beauty.\"\nHaving come into contact with a lot of important figures recently, Mary smiled and said, \"Roselle said that exercise is a necessity of life, and Stelyn is always at home, dealing with trivial matters. Even when she's out, she would be participating in parties and listening to operas. Her health is much worse than it used to be, so I brought her here to play tennis and squash.\"\nWith her high cheekbones, she looked around and saw a member of the House of Commons and two other Members of Parliament of the greater Backlund area. She then turned to Stelyn and said, \"I see someone I know. Excuse me while I head over to greet them. You can wait for me at the library.\"\n\"Alright.\" Compared to Mary, Stelyn was clearly much prettier, but towards this lady, she seemed very respectful and docile.\nAfter Mary had gone some distance away, she slightly raised her chin, looked at Klein and asked, \"Mr. Moriarty, you seem very busy these days?\"\n\"Yes, I was working with a lot of detectives to help the police investigate the serial murder case. We made a certain contribution and received quite a sizable reward,\" Klein answered truthfully.\nStelyn covered her mouth with her hand.\n\"Really?\n\"What did the murderer look like? Why did he kill those ladies? The newspapers had been very vague.\"\n\"I'm sorry, I have to comply with the confidentiality clause.\" Klein deftly made up an excuse.\nIt's not like I can tell you that it had a body of black fur; a smooth, glistening tail; and that it likes to run on all fours...Klein lampooned inwardly.\nStelyn nodded regretfully, and then she asked curiously, \"So how much did you get?\"\n\"It was split among quite a number of us.\" Klein didn't answer directly.\n\"Was there fifty pounds?\" Stelyn pressed.\n\"Yes.\" Klein nodded\"honestly.\"\nStelyn Sammer smiled.\n\"You earn a lot more than I imagined. You really are a capable detective.\"\n\"No, it might take years to come across such a case.\" Klein smiled and shook his head.\n\"No matter what, you have proven your ability.\" Stelyn's eyes looked like they were thinking as she said, \"Next Sunday, Luke and I will be hosting a party at home. I hope you can come, um, sorry. I was very presumptuous. I'll have my maid send the invitation to you. Heh heh, there will be a lot of unmarried ladies at the party, and their fathers or mothers will have decent jobs, and their families will earn more than 200 pounds a year. Some of them have part-time jobs that they can do at home, such as being a typist. They're all very excellent women.\"\nTh-this is a blind date party... Mrs. Stelyn has approved of my ability to make money as a detective, so she plans on introducing me to a girl? But in her eyes, am I only fit to be with a woman at that level?Many thoughts flashed through Klein's mind, but after considering the need to maintain their neighborly friendliness and the trouble of preparing his own dinner, he agreed with a smile.\n\"If all goes well, I'll be there on time.\"\nStelyn smiled and said, \"Then Luke and I will be awaiting your visit.\"\nShe left without another word and entered the small library of the club, while Klein proceeded to practice his shooting and Beyonder powers in the small, enclosed shooting range.\n...\nAt 9 o'clock at night, Klein was sitting at his desk, watching as the crimson moon gradually pierced through the clouds, revealing a full body.\nThe water-like, light red \"veil\" slowly spread out, and time passed by the minute. When it was quarter past ten, he heard illusory pleas that seemed layered.\nKlein easily guessed that it was from Miss Magician.\nClosing the curtains, he switched off the lights, took four steps counterclockwise, and went above the gray mist. There, he reached out to touch the shrinking and expanding crimson star.\nIn a split-second, the hazy figure of Fors appeared on the chair with the symbol of a layered door.\nShe let out a sigh of relief, stood up, and bowed.\n\"Honorable Mr. Fool, you have saved me once again.\"\n\"That's not something to worry about,\" Klein replied in a very light, casual tone.\nFors was left speechless and sat down again.\nShe was considering what had just happened, so she didn't say anything. As for Klein, he didn't take the initiative to bring up any subjects in order to maintain his image.\nWithin the towering palace which looked like a giant's residence, the silence quickly transformed into the main theme.\nWhen Fors snapped back to her senses, she suddenly felt that this atmosphere was a little oppressive and uncomfortable.\nDuring the gathering, there's still Miss Justice, Mr. World, and company. There was no need to worry about complete silence, but now, there's only Mr. Fool and me. What should I do? This pressure is stifling! I need to say something, I have to. I can't just sit here like an idiot... That's Mr. Fool! He certainly wouldn't care about anything, but I'm so nervous and restricted!Fors suddenly felt as though she had found herself alone with her boss when she first entered the workforce.\nAlthough Klein wasn't a Spectator, he could clearly see Miss Magician's restraint and uneasiness. He smiled and said, \"Maybe you can tell me how you became a Beyonder.\"\nFor example, how you obtained the Apprentice formula and that bracelet...Klein silently added the real question he was trying to get by.\nFors relaxed a little and recalled.\n\"That was almost three years ago. I just graduated from Backlund Medical School.\n\"With my father's help, I entered a private clinic with pretty good benefits. Heh, my father had already settled down in East Balam back then.\n\"Ever since the safe sea route to the Southern Continent was discovered, the outstanding youth of the kingdom started spreading their footprints to every corner of the land. My father, as a low-level military officer, went to East Balam to chase after wealth and power. My mother and I were left behind in Backlund to live like widows. Heh heh, it would take months before a distant letter sent by boat would arrive.\n\"This situation isn't uncommon in the kingdom. I knew an old gentleman who had five children, but they were either in the archipelago, Western Balam, the Paz Valley, or the Haagenti Plains. They have their own career, their own family, and their own wealth, but they've forgotten that there is a father waiting for their return all this time.\n\"When I was in grammar school, my mother fell seriously ill. I had no choice but to helplessly watch her die on the hospital bed, and it took my father a month to answer my letter, telling me that he had a new family and a new life in East Balam. He gave me all his property in Backlund plus some money. I think he felt a little guilty.\"\nAs a best-selling novel writer, Fors had mastered the art of rambling.\nSince Klein had nothing to do, he listened quietly without interrupting.\nPhew.Fors exhaled and continued, \"Anyway, my father introduced me to Yosifov Clinic through the veterans' club. The salary there was really good, and I was doing pretty well, but I was a little anxious about the future. Hence, I worked hard to learn from the senior doctors and worked hard to save money until I met an old lady who came to see me regularly.\n\"She was very lonely and childless, and her partner had passed away ten years ago. I had some sympathy for her, so I often talked to her and accompanied her.\n\"Once, I was surprised to find that she was able to walk through walls, which opened a whole new world to me.\n\"That old lady said that it was something her husband left her. She vaguely mentioned that as long as one wasn't a member of some family, there was apparently no curse.\n\"Not long after, she was so ill that she was on the verge of passing away. She asked me if I wanted to become someone like her. I was very young then, and I still had a lot of fantasies in my head. I agreed without any hesitation.\n\"She gave me the formula and told me to watch her body after she died and take away the glowing object that would suddenly appear. And this was the thing she left me which could be used as the main ingredient of a potion.\n\"Also, she gave me this bracelet, telling me not to use it unless I'm in absolute danger. She also told me not to pay too much attention to the ravings during the full moon.\n\"Unfortunately, I was ultimately unable to avoid danger. After using it once, the full moon's raving became worse.\"\nIt seems like that was a widow of a particular Abraham... She had used her own experience to prove that the \"curse\" only existed in the bloodline...Klein nodded.\n\"Once you become a High-Sequence Beyonder, the ravings wouldn't have much of an effect on you.\"\n\"I hope so.\" Although she didn't believe she could become a High-Sequence Beyonder, she believed in Mr. Fool.\n...\nIt was Monday again, and as soon as Klein got up, he went downstairs and saw an open sheet of paper on the coffee table in the living room.\n\"Effective.\"\nThat's good...Klein immediately let out a sigh of relief.\nAt fifteen minutes to three in the afternoon, he promptly went above the gray fog to \"prepare\" for the new Tarot Club gathering."}
{"num_chp":417,"summary":"Seeing the scene in the silver mirror, Klein revealed a pensive expression.\nThis mirror is very powerful, and it even has its own name. It seems to be a living Sealed Artifact...\nSuch items might not be too harmful, but the difficulty of sealing it is very high. It's seldom used except for special situations. This person named Ikanser Bernard from the Machinery Hivemind seems to be highly-ranked. He should be a deacon, and definitely not a simple one at that...\nDivination is limited, so the outcome would almost be the same as the result shown by the silver mirror. Even if I were to go above the gray fog, I wouldn't obtain a better result.\nThere's no way to determine the Desire Apostle's appearance. There are countless people in Backlund with high cheekbones and blue eyes...\nAs Klein was in the midst of his thoughts, the scene produced by the silver mirror quickly dispersed.\nFollowing that, words in blood-red appeared.\n\"Based on the principle of reciprocity, it's my turn to ask the question. If you lie or are unable to answer, you will have to accept an arranged mission by me or suffer a penalty.\"\n\"...\" Klein pricked up his brows when he saw that.\nIs this some Truth or Dare mirror? Interesting...\nThe words which resembled dripping blood slowly changed into new characters, forming a new sentence: \"What is Red Light's true name?\"\nRed Light? One of the leaders of the Great White Brotherhood? One of the seven pure lights above the spirit world?\nKlein thought through it carefully and realized he didn't know the answer.\nHe only knew of Yellow Light, Venithan.\nIkanser's throat bobbed up and down as sweat gradually appeared on his forehead.\nAfter a brief moment of silence, he said in a deep voice, \"Nanides!\"\n\"Wrong.\" The blood-red words on the mirror changed again. \"Mission or penalty?\"\nThere was an obvious struggle on Ikanser's face. Finally, he breathed out and said, \"Penalty.\"\nJust as he finished speaking, a streak of silver-white lightning appeared out of nowhere and struck his head.\nWith sizzling sounds, Ikanser's hair stood on their ends, and his body collapsed with a thud. Small amounts of black smoke billowed from his body.\nHowever, the mirror didn't fall to the ground with him. Instead, it floated by itself and landed on the desk.\nAfter two seconds, Ikanser staggered to his feet and sat there, panting while shaking.\nKlein looked at everything in silence, unsure of how to react.\nAfter a while, Ikanser, who had recovered a little, looked at him and said with a forced smile, \"You should have heard of Sealed Artifacts and know that they come with certain negative effects.\"\n\"Yes.\" Klein looked at the standing hair on Ikanser's head and suddenly understood why his hairstyle was so frizzled, messy, and stubborn.\nKlein couldn't help but say, \"Actually, you could do the questioning alone. There's no need for you to do it in front of me.\"\n\"Phew, the requirement of using this mirror is that there must be someone watching by the side.\" Ikanser was still trembling.\nIt's so sentient...\nKlein took two steps forward and came to the table. He carefully looked at the silver mirror out of curiosity and found that, apart from the strange patterns and two decorative eyes, there was nothing special about the Sealed Artifact.\nIkanser, whose side was facing him, trembled as he chuckled.\n\"You can pose questions to him. We don't mind.\"\n\"No, I don't have any intention to.\" How could Klein play Truth or Dare with something like an ouija board?\nAs he spoke, he tried to touch the edge of the silver mirror.\nIt's ice-cold to the touch and has a metallic feeling...\nAs Klein had this thought, he saw the ancient silver mirror tremble slightly.\nWhite words quickly appeared on it: \"Your loyal and humble servant, Arrodes, at your service.\"\nAh?\nKlein's mind momentarily went blank.\nThen, he left the table without any change in expression.\nWhat's going on? This mirror was still playing Truth or Dare with others in a very cold and ruthless manner just a moment ago... How did it become like this in the blink of an eye?\nKlein was amused and puzzled.\nHe quickly made a guess based on the information he had gathered.\nThe silver mirror knows Red Light's true name, so it seems to be related to the spirit world to a certain extent...\nAnd the mysterious space above the gray fog seems to be connected to the spirit world as well. At the very least, when I summon myself, I will be able to see what appears to be the spirit world after passing through the door...\nIs this mirror named Arrodes able to sense the aura of the gray fog?\nWhile these thoughts were flashing through his mind, Klein saw that Ikanser had recovered and stood up once again. He grabbed the ancient silver mirror while the other two members in the room also stopped pretending that they hadn't seen anything while they were aimlessly searching the room.\nAfter a series of inspections, Klein bade Ikanser and company farewell and found Isengard Stanton who had returned to the activity room.\n\"What do we do next?\" he asked directly.\nIsengard replied with a solemn expression.\n\"Let's have Stuart and the others have their families move in together. It will make it easier to protect them. However, this can only be a short-term solution.\n\"You and I, as well as Kaslana, will act normally and receive secret protection. Let's hope the Desire Apostle can be found as soon as possible.\n\"You're a believer of the God of Steam and Machinery, right?\"\n\"Yes,\" Klein replied as he drew a triangular Sacred Emblem on his chest.\nAt the same time, he lamented a little.\nFor the foreseeable future, I can only go above the gray fog while inside the bathroom...\n...\nIn Empress Borough, the opulent villa of Earl Hall.\nAudrey glanced at the elegantly-shaped wall clock and slowly sat down in front of the dressing table despite her nervousness and excitement.\nShe was heading to the home of her psychology teacher, Escalante, and take the key step of becoming an official member of the Psychology Alchemists.\nBefore doing so, she needed to time herself well before praying to Mr. Fool for his help.\nI should be able to see the angel this time, right?\nAudrey thought with anticipation.\nAfter a few seconds of silence, she clasped her hands together in front of her mouth and nose and softly chanted the honorific name of The Fool.\nIn 15 Minsk Street, Klein was standing in the living room, looking at the scene which had finally turned quiet as he sighed.\nTo him, the Desire Apostle only meant danger, but to Stuart and the others, it was a change in their lives.\nI hope it can be settled as soon as possible... With so many Beyonders with so many Sealed Artifacts, there must be something effective against the Devil pathway...\nIn the midst of his thoughts, Klein suddenly heard a series of illusory pleas.\nIt should be Miss Justice...\nHaving been prepared, he looked around before walking to the bathroom as if nothing had happened.\nAfter locking the bathroom door, he couldn't help but sigh inwardly.\nMy life has also changed a little...\nBefore the threat of the Desire Apostle was eliminated, he had to reduce the times he went above the gray fog while being secretly protected by the Machinery Hivemind.\nNext week, during the Tarot Club, the itinerary must be simplified. However, no matter how compressed it is, it'll still take nearly ten minutes. Well, constipation is a very normal thing. Who says that Beyonders can't be constipated?\nBeing optimistic, Klein took four steps counterclockwise and went above the gray fog.\nNext, Audrey followed what she had been previously taught and set up a simple ritual, entering the \"artificial sleepwalking\" state.\nWhen Klein saw her blurry figure inside the crimson star, he went through the procedure: first using his Spirit Body to contain the Dark Emperor card, then picking up the paper figurine he cut with his improved cutting skills, and sending it out.\nAs expected, the paper figurine gathered the power that was being stirred out of the gray fog, turning into a gigantic angel with twelve pairs of black wings.\nAudrey watched as the sacred and majestic angel descended before her, wrapping herself in its layers of wings. She was left speechless for quite some time.\nThis is an angel, Mr. Fool's angel... And it even has twelve pairs of wings, an archangel! This is exactly the same as the descriptions in the legends of canon... This is also an angel of our Tarot Club!\nAudrey watched as the angel's silhouette rapidly faded away. She suddenly felt that it was exceptionally sweet.\nShe thanked Mr. Fool with joy, excitement, and piousness, and then she called the maids and told them to get ready for her trip outdoors.\nKlein smiled and returned to the living room, looking at the bullet hole in the wall and lost himself in thought.\nShould I hang a cheap oil painting to cover it or repair it and paint over it?\n...\nIn Escalante's house at Hillston Borough, Seventh Avenue.\nAudrey left her maid and bodyguard in the living room and followed the mistress of the house into the activity room with Susie, her huge golden retriever.\nIn the activity room, there were two other people waiting. One of them was Hilbert Alucard, the psychologist who was introduced to her by Lady Norma. The other was Stephen Hampres who had organized the previous psychology discussion.\nAt that moment, although it was already time for the banquet, there was only a single ordinary candle lit in the room.\nThe candle was placed in the middle of the coffee table as its faint yellow flame flickered, dispersing the darkness in the activity room.\nAfter greeting each other, Hilbert, with his slightly brown skin that was thanks to the tiny bit of Southern Continent blood in him, glanced at Susie, but he didn't say a word.\nAudrey smiled apologetically and said, \"I feel more secure with it around.\"\nSusie also looked at Hilbert with innocent eyes.\n\"Understandable. Please have a seat.\" Hilbert smiled and sat down on the sofa on the other side of the coffee table. Hampres and Escalante also took their seats.\nAfter Audrey had taken her seat, Hilbert lifted the candle wick to brighten it a little.\nHe looked at Audrey through the candlelight.\n\"Now answer me honestly. Are you sure you want to join the Psychology Alchemists?\"\nUnder the illumination of the candlelight, his eyes seemed to be dyed with a hint of gold. Deep within his pupils, there seemed to be another eye, a vertical eye.\nAudrey's mind suddenly turned adrift for a moment before she regained her senses. She lightly nodded and said, \"Yes.\"\nHilbert asked again, \"Will you intentionally hurt the Psychology Alchemists?\"\nHis tone carried a strange inducement, as though as long as the person being questioned gave an affirmative answer, they would unwittingly agree and abide by it from the bottom of their hearts.\n\"No,\" Audrey answered very logically.\nAfter a few questions, Hilbert, Escalante, and the others heaved sighs of relief.\nThe former smiled and asked, \"Is there anything else you would like to say?\"\nAudrey hesitated for a moment and then displayed her sincerity.\n\"I once purchased the Spectator formula at a Beyonder gathering. I-I'm already a Spectator.\"\nThat Beyonder gathering is called the Tarot Gathering...\nAudrey thought to herself proudly."}
{"num_chp":498,"summary":"The standoff was between a brawny man in a blue white-striped shirt, a symbol of the navy. Despite the weather being at near zero temperatures, he had his arms bare.\nHe held a dagger against the throat of the man opposite him, but his glabella was being pointed at by an ancient musket, one which could've been placed in a museum.\nThe musket's owner was also more than 1.8 meters tall, with strong muscles and an oily face. He had shaved his hair, and with a sea eagle tattoo, he cursed, \"Dogsh*t Navy sailor!\n\"No one in Damir Harbor would dare slander me as a pirate's informant!\"\nThe Navy sailor didn't yield to him, and both sides fully illustrated the rich profanities of the sea.\nKlein observed for a few seconds, then he walked around the edge to Captain Elland, who had a straight sword at his waist and a hidden musket on his body. He asked in a calm and casual manner, \"What happened?\"\n\"A quarrel between two drunkards. In Damir Harbor and in the surrounding waters, there's always been such rumors that Sea Eagle Logan is in service of the master of the Black Tulip. The Navy sailor had mentioned this a moment ago, and Sea Eagle just happened to hear that.\"\nThe master of the Black Tulip? Isn't that Admiral Hell Ludwell?Klein turned and sat down on the high stool in front of the bar counter. He tapped the wooden countertop.\n\"One glass of Southville beer.\"\n\"Six pence.\" A bronze-skinned bartender with pearly-white teeth wiped the cups as he said with zero passion.\nWhen it comes to continental specialties, the prices are much higher than Backlund and Tingen...Klein fished out a handful of copper pence, counted six pence and gave it to him.\nAt this moment, Logan and the Navy sailor were stopped by the bar's bouncer. After they each spoke harshly to each other, they retreated to different corners.\nPerhaps it was due to him losing his dignity, the Navy sailor hurriedly left after about ten seconds. The atmosphere in the bar became lively once again.\n\"Want to play some cards?\" Captain Elland pointed to the stairs by the side of the bar.\n\"No.\" Klein's main purpose for coming was to gather information.\nElland subconsciously wanted to pat him on the shoulder, but his cold and sharp demeanor stopped him. He could only pull back his hand and pretend to adjust his dark red coat and remind him, \"Don't get the women here.\"\nKlein nodded, picked up the glass of Southville beer, and took a swig.\n\"Also, don't trust anyone here. Only a small portion of what they say is true.\" Elland carried his Lanti Proof and stepped onto the stairs that led to the second floor.\nKlein turned his head to glance at him and asked without a change in expression, \"Including you?\"\n\"... Perhaps.\" Elland was taken aback at first before he laughed out loud. \"At least my reminder just now was real. Oh, and me being a man is true as well!\"\nNot necessarily... There's a potion called Witch in this world...Klein looked away, drinking slowly and listening to the surrounding drinkers boasting.\nTwo or three minutes later, a short, thin man sat down next to Klein with his drink.\n\"Mate, you look like an adventurer.\" He tilted his head and smiled.\nThe man who greeted him had black hair, blue eyes, and aged facial features. His temperament was rather wretched.\n\"You could say that,\" Klein replied coldly.\n\"I can tell you're a hunter, a hunter that chases after bounties and riches.\" The short man looked around and lowered his head, suppressing his voice while he said, \"Have you heard of the Specter Empire?\"\nI've heard of Amway, and I've also heard of the Father in Heaven and the Messiah being sealed at the bottom of the sea...Using the power of Faceless, Klein sent out a signal not to approach him.\n\"Yes, a huge, ancient ghost ship full of treasures.\"\n\"We have clues to it!\" the short man said in an infectious tone. \"We found some information about where it will appear next! We don't want the pirates or the Navy to benefit from it, and we don't want to be robbed of our wealth, so we've decided to hire our own armed merchant ships to wait in that area, which would probably cost about 1,000 pounds. I've already found 15 companions and raised 720 pounds. Are you interested in participating?\"\nWithout waiting for Klein to speak, he fumbled for a stack of brownish-yellow letters.\n\"I know you won't believe it so easily. In fact, no one will, but after the fifteen friends who read through this information, all of them decided to join in on our plan.\"\n... Do I have a such a gullible face? Or would any bumpkin end up in this situation without slipping away from this sort of thing?While Klein was considering whether to appraise the letters, from the corner of his eye, he saw that Sea Eagle Logan, who was previously squabbling, was walking towards him.\n\"Woody, you're trying to scam someone again! You damn sewer rat!\" Logan picked up the short man and threw him into the open space in the middle of the bar, where he landed on the ground, sprawling.\nThe muscular man, with the bluish-green tattoo on his head, sat in the same position as Woody and guffawed.\n\"Sorry, these are the rats of our Damir Harbor. They always do things that ruin our reputation.\n\"In fact, we're all very friendly. If you have anything you want to ask about, don't hesitate to ask me.\n\"Heh heh, don't believe what they say about me. I'm an upright person, and I have nothing to do with Admiral Hell!\"\nThe more you emphasize that, the more suspicious it becomes...Klein's expression didn't change as he calmly said, \"I want to know the latest rumors.\"\n\"No problem.\" Sea Eagle Logan slammed the bar top and said to the bartender, \"Give me a plate of special cured meat. I'll be treating this mate to our most famous delicacy in Damir.\"\nThe bartender, while still maintaining his cold expression, pushed open the door and entered the kitchen. Soon, he brought out a plate of red and white, finely cut cured meat.\n\"Five pounds.\" He didn't look at Sea Eagle Logan, and he instead looked straight at Klein.\n\"Five pounds.\" Sea Eagle Logan turned his head to the side, smiling warmly as he raised his arm to show his muscles. \"Everyone just heard it. In order to thank me, you offered to treat me to some special cured meat.\nFor a moment, Klein didn't realize what had happened. It was only when the bartender urged him a second time that he realized he was being blackmailed. Furthermore, their scam was rather well-planned.\nFirst they used an easily seen through farce to let Sea Eagle Logan appear, thereby winning a good impression with the target, then, with the excuse of treating the target, order an especially expensive special cured meat, and then finally, he goes back on his word and turns matters upside down and forcing a sale... It's no wonder that when Rat Woody was thrown out, those drunkards didn't make a sound... They were all afraid of this Logan whose rumored to be in the service of Admiral Hell... How should I deal with this? My present persona is Gehrman Sparrow, a somewhat crazy adventurer and bounty hunter...Klein raised his cup and drank a mouthful of the rich malt-flavored beer and said with his usual tone, \"Why don't you just rob me?\"\n\"Why don't I just rob you?\" Logan was a little stunned by the question.\nSoon after, he saw a fist expanding before his face.\nThump!\nKlein's left fist landed on Sea Eagle Logan's chin, knocking him backwards toward the bar counter.\nWith a push of his right palm, Klein nimbly left his chair and approached Logan's falling body.\nHis legs tensed, and his knees jerked upward, slamming into Logan's lower abdomen.\nPfft!Logan threw back his head, his eyes bulging while his mouth hung half open.\nKlein drew his gun, shoved the revolver into the man's mouth, and pulled the hammer back.\n\"I... I am...\" Logan shouted indistinctly.\nKlein looked him in the eye, pulled out his revolver, and swung it, striking the side of Logan's face with the butt of the gun.\nLogan's teeth fell out one after another, and his mouth was stained with blood.\nFaced with such a heavy blow and a pain that exceeded his limits, his eyes rolled back, and he fainted.\nKlein propped him up and pulled a handful of loose bills and coins out of his pocket.\nSince he estimated that there wasn't more than five pounds with just a glance, Klein threw them on the bar and calmly said, \"Keep the change.\"\nThe bartender's bronze face turned slightly pale as he shouted in panic, \"My boss is White Shark!\"\nWithout looking at him, Klein released his hand and allowed Sea Eagle Logan to fall to the ground. Then he sat down again, forked up a piece of cured meat, and stuffed it in his mouth to taste it. He found it rather unique as the flavors of the condiments spread out in wisps, scratching at his belly and throat.\nAfter eating two pieces, he looked up and asked, \"Does your boss know that you're colluding with Sea Eagle?\"\n\"No, he... No...\" the bartender mumbled an answer.\nSeeing that Klein had no intention of continuing his attacks and had paid the bill so quickly, the bouncers who had gathered nearby silently retreated.\nKlein took a sip of his wine, glanced at Sea Eagle Logan on the ground, and calmly said to the bartender, \"He's Ludwell's informant. How much is his bounty worth?\"\n\"No, he's not.\" The bartender shook his head and said, \"This is just something he says about himself-the information he spread himself. That Navy sailor from before was hired by him! That's the only way to make everyone here afraid of him...\"\nUpon hearing this answer, the drinkers at the bar all put down their glasses in surprise. Some of the drunkards even staggered over to Logan and spat in his face.\nPui! Pui! Pui!Many drinkers followed suit.\nKlein lowered his head again and said while eating the special cured meat, \"Tell me about the recent rumors.\"\nThe bartender breathed a sigh of relief as he wiped his glass and gave an intermittent account of the rumors in the past two months. Some of them were what Klein had heard before, and there were also things he just learned.\nThe Imperial Navy's ironclad warship, Pritz, had destroyed a passing pirate crew during routine training... Panic over the behemoth's cannons has begun to spread among the small and medium-sized pirate powers... Some of them even wished to take advantage of the ironclad warship fleet's inchoate form to madly commit crimes before withdrawing from this trade with a sum of money... The sea wouldn't be peaceful for the next six months to a year... Admiral of Blood Senor and Rear Admiral Dusk Bulatov Ioan had a conflict in the southern waters of Sonia Island, and each of them lost two ships in the massive skirmish...Klein listened without asking questions, and he gradually filled his stomach.\nSeeing that the plate containing the special cured meat had been emptied and having finished the rest of his beer, he slowly stood up.\n\"Remember today's lesson.\" Klein handed the plate to the bartender.\nThe bartender was about to reach out when the hair at the back of his head was grabbed.\nBang!\nKlein shoved him down hard, knocking the bartender's head against the bar top, sending splinters flying and blood gushing. The customers all tried to avoid the impact, and the bouncers rushed over quickly.\nAfter doing all of this, Klein clapped his hands and picked up his own glass, trying to pour the rest of the beer onto the bartender's head.\nOne drop, two drops, three drops...\nKlein silently gave up. He turned around and bent down, grabbed Sea Eagle Logan, and threw him to the bouncers who were rushing over.\nTaking advantage of the moment when the bouncers were dodging and the bar being in chaos, Klein quickly ran, agilely circling around them, and easily left Flying Fish & Wine.\nHe pushed down his hat and quickly proceeded forward, turning towards a neighboring street.\nAfter continuously changing directions, he suddenly slowed down his pace, and a gold coin appeared in his hand.\nThe gold coin kept weaving around in his fingers as if it was scouting something."}
{"num_chp":641,"summary":"Nina was a pirate who had risen up the ranks. Often, she might be easily irritated, but she was very experienced at handling matters. She was a rather reliable person. After some thought, she gave a description in a serious manner.\n\"The well's mouth is at a rather deep depth along the seabed. I need enough time to adjust myself before I can acclimatize to the temperature and pressure of the area. That's why I took so much time to get there.\n\"It isn't easily discovered, but the remnant iron buildings are indeed rather obvious. I found them once I got acclimatized.\n\"They've already completely collapsed or rotted. There's no way to imagine what they originally looked like. However, I could tell that they definitely spanned across a great distance in the past. It's just shrunken by a great deal now.\"\nWhen Nina said this, she chuckled and scanned all the men around her.\nA real female pirate is indeed different...Klein sighed from the bottom of his heart.\nFrom his point of view, be it Admiral of Stars Cattleya, Vice Admiral Iceberg Edwina, or Vice Admiral Ailment Tracy, none of them could be considered a pure female pirate. All of them hailed from major factions or secret organizations. When they were Low-Sequence Beyonders, they were either not at sea, or they were following important figures, so what they did were relatively safe matters. Otherwise, they were independent adventurers who had never been tainted by the characters and atmosphere of low- or mid-level pirates.\nAfter Nina finished laughing, Cattleya pointed her finger to the rusted item that could hardly be described as a metal beam.\n\"This is a portion of the iron building?\"\n\"Yes, Captain. As you know, I don't know much about history or mysticism. I could only bring some back for your inspection. You're an expert on this.\" Nina smiled as she handed the \"metal beam\" over.\nThen, she pointed at the black piece of hardened mud which was filled with holes on its surface.\n\"Not far from the iron ruins, I found a well. It's not very big. If it's to be described with the word \u2018huge,' then I've definitely seen plenty of huge cannons.\n\"Those drunken adventurers are better at bragging than us pirates!\n\"This is the mud from the inner layer of the well. I can't imagine how such patterns could be formed!\"\nNina's finger repeatedly struck the honeycombed dots on the black mud.\nKlein originally believed that they were marks left behind by dense shots with very tiny projectiles, but after a careful inspection, he suspected that they were remnant \"patterns\" after something had rotted. Each spot was very shallow as its edges spread outwards in an irregular pattern.\nNina handed the black mud to Cattleya as she continued describing, \"The well's mouth is really small. Even a child from Nas wouldn't be able to enter.\n\"It's very deep. I even felt that it was bottomless. In that environment, the interior was completely dark as though something was slowly summoning me, yes-slowly.\n\"I found a few rocks nearby and threw them in, but there wasn't any response. In short, it's filled with water.\"\nCattleya held up the \"metallic beam\" and black mud. Through the thick glasses, she observed them seriously.\n\"Since the mouth is very small and humans can't enter them, there's no need for us to begin the exploration immediately. It will be very dangerous.\n\"Let's wait until I figure out the secrets hidden within these items and whether the ancient well is worth us taking the risk before we return to make an attempt.\"\n\"Aye aye, Captain!\" The wet Nina was trembling as a result of the cold winds. The way she wavered made all the surrounding pirates stare straight at her.\nCattleya nudged her glasses and said to Nina, \"You can drink a bottle of Sonia blood wine. There's no limit for the rest.\"\n\"... Long live the captain!\" Nina cried out in joy.\nAn underwater well that humans can't enter...Klein, who had no desire to explore it, summarized Nina's description.\nSuddenly, he had a strange idea.\nHumans are unable to enter the well, but that doesn't mean that non-humans can't do it!\nMany deep-sea fishes aren't necessarily that huge. There's a significant chance that they can pass through the well.\nAs the \"Sea God,\" he had the means to make marine creatures do his bidding while wielding the scepter!\nThere's no rush. Let's see if Ma'am Hermit is able to figure out anything from these two objects. I'll consider whether I'll explore it on the return trip; otherwise, I might attract some exaggerated danger... There's still not enough information regarding this. There's no way to do any divination...As his thoughts wandered, Klein's expression remained deadpan.\nAt that moment, Cattleya shot him a glance out of curiosity. Then, she retracted her gaze without leaving any traces.\nWhy did she suddenly look at me? She was seeing what I was doing? It's impossible for her to know that I possess the Sea God Scepter and can make marine creatures do my bidding. That's not right. She knows, but she only knows that Mr. Fool wields Kalvetua's godhood scepter, not The World... Unless she has figured out that The World is The Fool... But that's even more impossible. Even Mr. Hanged Man is still stuck at the concept that The World is a Blessed. She hasn't even realized this point...\nViewing this from a different point of view, I'll consider it from Admiral of Stars's angle... She's someone being pursued by knowledge, and she's a follower of Queen Mystic. She's loyal to the Moses Ascetic Order, and she has roamed the sea for years. She has plenty of knowledge and experience, so it wouldn't be odd that she knows that the Sea God domain possesses the Beyonder power to control marine creatures.\nTherefore, after realizing that humans are unable to pass through the ancient well, she naturally made the connection with the scepter in Mr. Fool's hand. Does she plan on requesting for help in the future? She looked at me to figure out if The World has also grasped the corresponding information or have similar ideas?\nMany ideas went through Klein's mind. With the powers of Clown, he forcefully maintained his indifferent expression. He didn't react abnormally in any way.\nAs Nina was about to draw the Sonia blood wine, Klein pressed down his hat and returned to the cabin.\nJust as he was about to approach the door, a figure surfaced in his mind suddenly.\nIn a room in the cabin's upper level, the windows were tightly shut and the curtains were drawn. There were a pair of blurry eyes hidden behind them, silently watching the crowd on the deck, as well as Gehrman Sparrow.\nWho is it?Klein didn't stop. His body didn't show any hesitation as he entered the cabin normally as though nothing had happened.\n...\nAt three in the afternoon, the bright but not scorching sunlight shone into the garden adjacent to Stoen University.\nMichele Deuth was already a Senior Associate Professor by forty. He was wearing a long tailcoat and a beautiful bow tie as he waited by the door.\nYesterday evening, he received a letter. The sender was from the attendant of the richest aristocratic family in East Chester County, the Hall family. The person who wrote the letter was the daughter of a Member of Parliament from the House of Lords who wielded immense influence. She was Miss Audrey Hall, who was deemed to be the most stunning gem in Backlund.\nThis noble lady had mentioned in the letter that she had learned from a gathering that Mr. Michele Deuth was an outstanding collector and an aficionado of this domain. She had a great desire in paying a visit.\nMichele Deuth didn't have any reason to refuse.\nSoon, a classic carriage with a family emblem arrived at the door.\nTwo servants, who had been instructed to open the outer gates made of iron railings, led the carriage around the garden and arrived in front of the house.\nA housekeeper was the first to alight, followed by guards and maidservants.\nFollowing that, a hand wearing a long white-gauzed glove was extended outside.\nWith the help of the maidservants, Audrey elegantly stepped onto the carpet which Michele had paved.\nMichele was first taken aback before his eyes lit up. He felt as though the flowers in the garden had instantly faded.\nHe took two steps forward and took off his hat to bow.\n\"Welcome, my honorable lady.\n\"Your visit is an honor for me and my family.\"\nAudrey took off the veiled hat and passed it to her maidservant before exchanging a few pleasantries. Then, she followed Michele Deuth into the living room and entered the collector's room on the first floor.\nHere, Michele finally found his confidence as the master of the house. He began pointing at his collection and providing an introduction from the left.\n\"This is a helmet that appeared in the White Rose War. After lots of research, it can be determined that the owner is a member of the Sauron family. Back then, they were still considered royalty.\"\nThe golden helmet had an intricate design. There were avian and flying wings that adorned it, and the visor was formed from pieces of golden scales.\n\"My ancestor obtained his first aristocratic title in that war,\" Audrey replied with piqued interest.\nShe had already adjusted her mental state ahead of time-she was to appear as though she was really here to tour the collections.\n\"The failure of the Twenty Year War had caused the kingdom to suffer years of humiliation, but it also carved out several heroes.\" Michele resorted to flattery.\nThe White Rose War happened after the Twenty Year War and before the Battle of the Violated Oath. There, Loen defeated Intis and became strong again.\nMichele continued introducing his collection as Audrey solemnly listened, raising questions from time to time as she conversed with him.\nFinally, Michele's finger pointed towards a notebook with a black cover.\n\"This belonged to a knight stationed on Sonia Island in the Twenty Year War.\n\"This knight's name has already vanished in the long rivers of history. This notebook is the only proof of his existence. He once stood fast until the very last moment on Sonia Island.\n\"This notebook is not only a first-hand account for the research of that portion of history, but it also hides certain problems. The knight's grammar has many uncommon habits. This might be a clue to aid us in determining his exact identity.\"\nAudrey instinctively believed that the notebook was her target. Hence, she only leaned in a little. Indeed, the black cover had unobvious patterns. Together, they outlined an abstract image of a dragon.\nFrom Michele's tone and minute expressions, his interest is focused on the content and not the item itself. He doesn't particularly treasure it... I have a high chance of purchasing it...Audrey calmly made a judgment as she turned her head. She then smiled at Michele Deuth and said, \"What are the uncommon habits exactly?\"\n\"Enjoys using short sentences-very simple and short ones...\" Michele described in a flaunting tone.\nAudrey was always a good listener. She looked at him with a smile as she listened with focused attention. This made Michele speak more.\nAs she listened, she suddenly felt that the knight's grammatical habits were somewhat familiar.\nThat is...Audrey's eyes darted around slightly as she quickly remembered the source of the familiarity.\nThis was a grammatical habit of Dragonese which she had diligently mastered!"}
{"num_chp":180,"summary":"Upon hearing The Fool's question, Audrey perked up her ears and entered her Spectator state. She waited for The Sun to answer.\nShe had always been curious about where the City of Silver was and what was so special about that place, but she couldn't bring herself to ask. It touched upon his privacy after all.\nAt that moment, Mr. Fool was asking personally. It was like finishing the first volume of an outstanding detective novel she had been reading for a long time, and she finally had the chance to buy the next volume!\nThe Sun's answer didn't disappoint her. They didn't believe in the mainstream seven orthodox deities, nor did they believe in Death as the Southern Continent did. They also didn't believe in the hidden existences, evil gods or devils-Primordial Demoness, Hidden Sage, Dark Side of the Universe, Chained God, or the True Creator-which The Hanged Man had told her before.\nThe City of Silver is really special! They actually worship the Creator Himself! This is the primordial worship that Mr. Hanged Man described, right? Hmm, the description of omnipotence is a little strange...Audrey stole a glance at The Hanged Man subconsciously and realized that he was nodding slightly.\nKlein wasn't surprised at all. He purposely chuckled and asked in reply, \"Even though He abandoned you?\"\nAbandoned? The Creator abandoned the City of Silver?Alger was shocked. Suddenly when he suddenly made the connection regarding a particular term.\nThe Forsaken Land of the Gods!\nIn the confidential information of the Church of the Lord of Storms, at the security clearance level that Alger, who was Captain-equivalent to the Bishop level-could access, the Forsaken Land of the Gods had always only been a name with no actual description. However, it clearly pointed towards the end of the Sonia Sea. From what he knew, even the Cardinals at the core of the church had no idea what the Forsaken Land of the Gods represented. But only the leader of the church, the Proxy of the Lord of Storms, knew something about the situation and seemed to be taking charge of the hidden mission to look for the Forsaken Land of the Gods.\nAlger had once made a bold guess when he equated the True Creator's holy residence which was promoted by the Aurora Order with the Forsaken Land of the Gods. But, unfortunately, The Fool hadn't confirmed his guess, so he couldn't be sure.\nNow, he was shocked and surprised to find that the Tarot Club member using The Sun as his code name was very likely from the Forsaken Land of the Gods!\nMr. Fool knew where the Forsaken Land of the Gods was all this time, and he could pull someone from there to be a member of the Gathering! This is a hidden place that the Church of the Lord of Storms has been trying to find to no avail!\nAlger looked at The Fool who was seated in the seat of honor at the end of the ancient long bronze table in horror. He could only see that he was leaning back in his chair in silence, engulfed by the thick fog.\nAudrey wasn't particularly moved about it. The only time that she had heard about the Forsaken Land of the Gods was from The Hanged Man's question. She wasn't particularly interested, so she failed to associate it to anything from what Mr. Fool said earlier.\nThe City of Silver has the legend about being abandoned by the Creator... Huh, Mr. Hanged Man seems to be deeply affected... What is he amazed and afraid of?Audrey nodded in puzzlement as she remembered the details of the moment.\n\"Yes, we believe that we will regain the Lord's favor in the end. Perhaps, it will be on the day the sun rises again,\" Derrick Berg answered in an uncertain tone. \"We were once ruled by the giants' royal family, and we worshiped the Giant King Aurmir. Later, we were saved by the Lord and we will never betray the Lord again.\"\nRuled by the giants' royal family... It really is ancient. But it doesn't seem to match...Alger, who had guessed at something, suddenly recalled the description about the Second Epoch in the hidden chapter of The Book of Storms.\nThe Second Epoch was also known as humanity's Dark Epoch. At the time, the sky, ocean, and land were ruled over by dragons, giants, elves, mutants, devils, phoenixes, demonic wolves, and dead spirits. But in the end, the Lord of Storms, Eternal Blazing Sun, and the God of Knowledge and Wisdom led humanity into defeating the supernatural creatures and ushered in the beginning of the Third Epoch, the Glorious Era, which was later known as Cataclysm.\nGiant King Aurmir...Klein repeated the name in silence.\nIn various legends and myths, it was a great existence on par with the deities. Even now, there were still some places that worshiped him. Even the most famous and most expensive grape wine in the Intis Republic was named after Aurmir. It was said that the Giant King particularly fancied grape wine which was like blood.\nConsidering the fact that the Church of the God of Combat is in control of the complete pathway of the Warrior, which once belonged to the giants, can I assume that Aurmir was the ancient God of Combat?Klein guessed.\nHe nodded deliberately but didn't think any further about it. He then asked calmly, \"Do you still offer sacrifices to this omnipotent God?\"\n\"Yes, we still do. But since the day we were abandoned, we have never gotten any response.\" Derrick's voice had a hint of unconcealed pain.\nKlein leaned against the back of his chair leisurely. He half-closed his eyes and said, \"Describe the process of your offering ritual in detail.\"\nDoes Mr. Fool want to figure out the truth behind the City of Silver's abandonment? Or does He want to determine if the Creator still exists?Alger suddenly felt a shock through his body and he quivered.\nNot only was he afraid, but he was also excited too. This was because he felt he was being made privy to the secrets between deities!\nThat made him feel like he had been elevated to a whole new level!\nI've been chasing after power, after strength. Didn't I do it to achieve this kind of feeling?Alger leaned back, lifted his chin, and got carried away with his thoughts.\nMr. Hanged Man's mental state doesn't seem to be normal...Audrey looked at him with pity.\nShe finally understood that there might be some sort of shocking secret behind the communication between Mr. Fool and The Sun, which led to The Hanged Man's loss of composure.\nAfter the Qilangos commission is over, I'll pay the price to get information about what Mr. Hanged Man learned today... I wonder if he would be willing to...Audrey thought in anticipation, yet was still a little worried.\nDerrick didn't notice the weight that was hanging on his answer as he replied frankly, \"We build opulent altars covered in the Lord's symbol. Every time we receive a bumper Black-Faced Grass harvest, we hold a sacrificial ritual.\n\"We use the monsters we capture in the depths of the darkness to use as sacrificial offerings. After we recite God's honorable title and the necessary prayers, we dance for Him and then kill the monsters, to let their spirituality and tainted blood dye the entire altar. If we haven't caught any monsters, then we use a sinner on the lowest floor in the City of Silver prison instead.\n\"Then, we turn the very first batch of Black-Faced Grass into food and serve it before the Lord.\n\"In the end, we sing praises in unison and end the ritual.\"\nSince I was planning to offer a sacrifice to myself, I'm not picky about time, and the altar can be as simple as possible. The most important part would be to open a channel with the aid of the monsters' spirituality or the blood containing Beyonder powers to complete the sacrifice offering. Of course, this is under the premise that one will receive a response? How extravagant...Klein used his mysticism knowledge to analyze every step of the sacrificial ritual in the City of Silver before finally saying, \"What are the corresponding prayers? What language do you recite them in?\"\nDerrick was also looking forward to this, so as to gain hints from Mr. Fool on how to shake off the curse, so he recalled it carefully and answered, \"We use Jotun, which is also our common language.\n\"The corresponding prayers are,\n\"\u2018Your devoted believers pray for your attention.\n\"We pray for you to take their offerings.\n\"We pray for you to open the gates to your Kingdom.'\"\n...\nKlein listened in silence and intentionally let the engulfing fog slowly swirl around him. He nodded as though deep in thought and remained silent.\nAs for what he learned from it, he obviously wouldn't share it...\nAlger found it very normal. How could the secrets of a deity be revealed directly to a mortal? Derrick also steeled his resolve to quickly grow in power, so that he could obtain something that could garner Mr. Fool's interest in exchange for his guidance.\nAfter some more communication, Klein ended the gathering. He watched Justice's, The Hanged Man's, and The Sun's figures vanish before him.\nHe looked down and saw the boundless gray fog and crimson stars that seemed eternally immutable.\nHowever, after he advanced to Sequence 8, he realized that he could connect even more stars. In other words, he could pull in more members.\nAt least two...Klein nodded indiscernibly.\nHe wasn't in a hurry to add new members. He planned to act as he had before. He would first wait and observe. If Justice and The Hanged Man had any recommendations, he could assess them first.\nWhat I saw the last few times was when The Sun was praying. There was a clear crystal ball before him, but ever since I pulled him into the world above the gray fog, that crystal ball has never appeared again... Does the prerequisite needed to pull people in through the connection of the crimson star have something to do with having a special item around them? Or does every crimson star correspond to an item in reality, which, when it's connected successfully, it would return to the world above the gray fog?\nI wonder if Miss Justice and Mr. Hanged Man were the same... Let's just assume that's the case. In that case, if people without this special item were to recite: \"The Fool that doesn't belong to this era, the mysterious ruler above the gray fog; the King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck.\" and allow me to hear their prayers, would I be able to pull them in?\nI can give it a try in the future.\nKlein didn't stay any longer. He wrapped himself with spirituality and stimulated a descent, leaving behind the lofty palace, the ancient table, and the twenty-two high-back chairs which sat immutably above the gray fog.\nHe had mastered the overflowing power of the Clown potion and eliminated the corresponding negative effects. Therefore, he wanted to try the ritual to summon himself!\nI wonder what I'll conjure this time...Klein thought in anticipation and fear as he fell through the mad ravings."}
{"num_chp":247,"summary":"The figure in the mirror was clear, but it was as though the woman in the black regal dress had never appeared.\nKlein secretly activated his Spirit Vision, but didn't find anything.\nDid I just hire a female ghost as my bodyguard? She's even stranger than a female ghost... At the very least, one can see ghosts with Spirit Vision...Klein thoughtfully touched Azik's copper whistle in his pocket, feeling nothing but its cold chill. Like before, it didn't have any additional changes.\nShe's unaffected by the copper whistle... Seems like she isn't an undead creature... However, I can't be sure. Back then, the copper whistle was buried with me, but the corpses surrounding me didn't act abnormally... Was it because those buried in the cemetery have experienced a send off by the priests and bishops? When does it work and when doesn't it... When this business with the ambassador is over, and if I'm still alive, I'll go to the cemetery and try to figure out the scope of its effect and its limits. I can't always carry a time bomb like this...Klein washed his face and walked out of the bathroom.\nJust as he picked up the newspaper in the living room and was going to read it in the living room or bedroom, he heard the doorbell ring.\nKlein's mind tensed up when he heard the tinkling sounds. He put on his coat, with all kinds of materials in it, and walked towards the door gingerly.\nHe clearly knew that danger was approaching in the next few days!\nAfter standing behind the door and waiting for a moment, the scene outside naturally surfaced in Klein's mind.\nThe crimson moon was faintly discernible in the sky. The elegant gas lamps on both sides of the street lit up the wet road. A boy wearing an old coat stood there. His bright red eyes were deep and adrift.\nIan Wright? Why did he appear? Isn't this what I saw in my dream divination? Is this the prelude to danger?Klein opened the door and took two cautious steps back.\n\"Detective Moriarty,\" Ian took off his brown top hat, bowed, and said in a low voice, \"I came to apologize. I'm sorry to have involved you in such a dangerous matter.\"\nKlein creased his eyebrows and probed, \"What you should've done is head to the police station.\"\nIan looked around and bowed his head.\n\"I just came out from MI9.\"\nAh? Is that the name of the military's special department?Klein stepped aside, pointed at the living room and said, \"Maybe we can have a chat.\"\nI have to at least know what placed me in this situation...He sighed inwardly.\nIan didn't stand on ceremony as he followed Klein into the living room and sat in the same spot as he did the last time.\nHe was just about to open his mouth when Klein suddenly added, \"If what you plan on saying will put me in greater danger, then there's no need to tell me about it.\"\n\"No, everything will soon be over.\" Ian had a calmness that was beyond his age.\nKlein was relieved and asked out of curiosity, \"So, what exactly happened?\"\nBefore he could finish his sentence, he saw a figure emerge from the panes of the oriel window across the room: a black regal dress, long hair tied in a bun, blue eyes, delicate features, and a pale face. It was the woman who had previously greeted Klein in the mirror.\nThis woman seemed to find an illusory high back chair and sat down. Her left palm supported her right elbow while her right hand supported her face, pretending to listen attentively while appearing expressionless.\nFor a moment, Klein was left at a loss.\nIan, who had been silent for a few seconds, said softly, \"In fact, Detective Zreal is a spy for the Feysac Empire. He adopted several vagrant children and taught them how to gather intelligence. I am one of them.\"\nSo that's how it is... I was involved in a huge spy conspiracy...Klein suddenly felt enlightened.\nIan looked at the coffee table and continued, \"We have the advantage of age, and are often ignored by others, allowing us to gather a lot of useful information. Two weeks ago, I stumbled upon clues regarding Helmosuin's manuscript.\"\n\"Helmosuin?\" Klein found the name familiar.\nIan looked up at him and explained, \"Turani von Helmosuin, the greatest scientist after Emperor Roselle, a mathematician, a mechanist, and the father of the second generation difference machine.\"\nSo it's him!Klein suddenly remembered the relevant information.\nHe wasn't only a great scientist, but also a crazy scientist. He believed that the inherent flaw in the existence of humans could only be fixed through machines. He loved eating sugar as if it was his own energy source. He mysteriously disappeared while researching a third generation difference machine, and was an important figure that every country was trying to find.\n\"His manuscript? Does the manuscript involve third generation difference machines?\" Klein asked probingly.\nA difference machine was a mechanical device for computing. It could effectively improve the efficiency of scientific research and various projects. In Klein's opinion, it was an alternative computer in the Age of Steam. Of course, it could only do computation at present.\nIan shook his head.\n\"I'm not sure. I didn't actually see it. Perhaps, it had some related ideas.\"\nHe paused for a moment, then went on to recount what had happened.\n\"When I reported this to Detective Zreal, he was very happy and told me to follow up on that lead while he immediately reported it to his superior.\n\"It took me some time to determine where the manuscript was, but I was afraid of the danger, so I didn't steal it directly. I decided to return to Detective Zreal, and after that, it was as I told you. Detective Zreal's house was infiltrated while many of the tiny traps were not restored, and he didn't respond to my contact request. The Zmanger gang tried to capture me...\n\"With your help, I confirmed the death of Detective Zreal. I took a fake tooth from his corpse. Oh, that happened after we parted.\n\"Detective Zreal told me that, inscribed on the inside of the fake tooth, there was a method to urgently contact his superior. It was a method that even he didn't know of and was something he would only remove if an accident occurred.\"\nKlein nodded slightly and said, \"So you sent a telegram?\"\nA rare look of surprise flashed across Ian's face as he asked, \"Did the people from MI9 tell you that?\"\n\"No, a friend of mine happened to see you on Bacardi Street.\" Klein casually made up an excuse.\n\"I see.\" Ian nodded in depression. \"I got in touch with Detective Zreal's superior in Backlund via telegram and arranged the time, place, and manner of meeting, but soon enough, I was found by the Zmanger gang. No, to be exact, it was an intelligence officer of the Intis Republic. That was what the people from MI9 people told me.\n\"Fortunately, MI9 arrived in time, and both sides engaged in a chaotic battle. I took this opportunity to escape.\n\"However, when I met with Detective Zreal's superior this afternoon, I was once again ambushed by the Intis intelligence officers. Unfortunately, I was caught by them, and I was very afraid of dying, so I told them everything that I knew. However, they didn't keep their promise and still wanted to kill me. At that moment, MI9 finally found me.\"\nIt is only during such times when you look like a fifteen or sixteen year old teenager...Just as Klein was reflecting over this, he suddenly thought of a problem from what Ian had just said.\nBack when he discovered that something important was left behind on Zreal's corpse and that Ian had successfully taken it away, he had written the matter off, thinking that the Beyonder was lacking in skill, and that the Beyonder had missed out on something because the mediumship provided little useful information.\nHowever, after confirming that the ambassador had a Mid-Sequence Beyonder of the Seer pathway, the situation became extremely peculiar. With powerful mediumship, it was impossible for the fake tooth to not be discovered.\nLeaving the body in such a remote and hard to find place didn't seem like a trap.\nCombined with Ian's description, the answer was obvious.\nKlein nodded and said, \"Have you ever thought of the possibility that Zreal's superior has traitors around him, a traitor who has defected to the Intis intelligence services?\n\"That's also why Zreal was exposed and killed when he obtained the clue to the manuscript, as well as why you were ambushed.\"\nIt was because the Intis ambassador had information about Zreal's superior which was why he didn't pay much attention to the urgent communication method inscribed on the inside of the tooth!\nZreal's report to his superior directly led to his demise!\nIan fell into a daze when he heard that. It took him quite a while before he clenched his fists in anger, trying hard to compose himself as he said, \"I didn't think of that. You really are an excellent detective...\"\nHe quietly let out a breath of air and changed the topic.\n\"I have divulged the whereabouts of the manuscript to MI9 and everything else. They also mentioned your predicament in passing. Heh, they didn't suspect me of lying, nor did they send anyone to watch me. All of them went to vie for the manuscript. However, with that kind of pressure, no one can lie.\"\nHaving said that, Ian stood up and gave a deep bow.\n\"Please allow me to apologize again.\n\"Sorry to have involved you in this. Actually, you don't need to hide anything for me.\"\nHaving understood the entire situation, Klein smiled and said, \"No, the main problem in this matter was because I made a mistake that made me end up in my current situation.\"\nAs he was listening, he used Ian's description of the entire situation and his reflections of the past few days and confirmed that he had made two mistakes.\nWhen I discovered that Ian's matter ran deeper than it appeared, I still accepted the request. That wasn't a problem since I only felt that it involved gangs, and there would be, at most, one or two Beyonders who wouldn't dare expose themselves. But the divination lacked enough information and ended with a failure... This was within the limits of what I could've resolved by myself, and typically speaking, there wouldn't have been any trouble. I could even take the opportunity to come into contact with Backlund's Beyonders.\nAfter finding Zreal's corpse and confirming that the matter ran deep, I should've considered the sensitivity of my identity and decisively extricated myself from this case. I should've let Ian deal with the subsequent matters himself. This wouldn't be problematic and would be a rather careful choice.\nOne of the mistakes I made was that I didn't flinch or reveal anything about Ian when Meursault came to me. I only thought that he was from a gang, and that there were some Beyonders behind that gang. Who would've guessed that it would involve a figure like the Intis ambassador; even more so, I never expected Meursault to be so rash. After failing his mission, he didn't threaten, intimidate me or proceed with other options. Instead, he came straight to kill me so that mediumship could be performed. He didn't even give me the chance to regret my decision. As a result, my situation worsened.\nSo, this isn't too subjective or too serious a mistake.\nThe one mistake that really caused me to be in such a passive situation was a tiny mistake I made from the very beginning. I had rented the house and accepted the mission as Sherlock Moriarty without donning a disguise!\nThis resulted in me not being able to flee after my identity as a Beyonder was exposed to the ambassador. Even as I acted horrified and frantic, making MI9 and the police department believe that my taking flight would only be normal, I didn't dare flee. I was afraid that when the ambassador failed to find a target for revenge, he would inform the officials about me. And according to my experience as a Nighthawk, most official enforcers like the Nighthawks, Machinery Hivemind, and Mandated Punishers harbor animosity towards uncontrolled Beyonders. They definitely wouldn't ignore me just because I'm a Low-Sequence Beyonder and would begin an investigation.\nIn time, my looks will be clear evidence. I will then be pursued by High-Sequence Beyonders from the Church of the Goddess because I resurrected despite having been involved with a Grade 0 Sealed Artifact.\nThere's no chance for such matters to be suddenly forgotten or thought of as nothing by others. I had to plan for the worst case scenario in advance, and if I only reacted when the ambassador took action, it would definitely be too late. Whether it's an assassination, finding a bodyguard, or buying items, all of them will require time.\nOnly if the ambassador and his assistant dies or attention is diverted to the investigation of his death will I be able to resolve this latent danger. His assistant doesn't have an official status, so he can't interact with the officials. For a mere Sequence 9 or Sequence 8 at best, someone whose whereabouts are unknown, there's no reason to go through the effort to report me.\nOf course, his death is the best outcome, then there won't be any latent danger.\nCompared to finding Mr. Azik for help or having attention placed on me because of 0-08 again, as well as being pursued by High-Sequence Beyonders, assassinating the ambassador is the relatively simpler choice... Even it fails, I can only bear one of the two outcomes...\nSigh, everything originated from a small oversight at the beginning. I just imagined that in a metropolis with over 5 million people and few people knowing me while I deliberately avoided the Nighthawks, there was no need for me to don a disguise every day, since it would be easier for others to notice something amiss. Yet, for such a small mistake, I would have to pay over 10,000 gold pounds as the price without having any guarantee of resolving it...\nI'm really like a Clown, with one mistake triggering a chain reaction, only to result in a desperate attempt to balance myself so as to please the audience...\nThis is all because of my lack of experience. This is the first time in my two lifetimes combined that I've ever been a fugitive.\nOnce this matter is completely resolved, exposing my identity as a Beyonder would no longer be that dangerous. They would only think that I obtained a potion while finding a bodyguard and not doubt my origins. Of course, I'll have to get used to wearing glasses and a mustache in the future so that the people around me will gradually get used to my new image. In the future when they ask me about me, they will only think of this new image.\nHaving thought through the entire matter, Klein's laugh became more pronounced, making Ian feel strange.\n\"It's time for me to leave. I'll need to disappear for a while; otherwise, I might be thrown into jail.\" Ian put on his hat, bade farewell, and left.\nKlein didn't stop him, watching him disappear into the crimson moonlight, while the woman by the oriel window had disappeared without him realizing it."}
{"num_chp":371,"summary":"\"No, it's just good luck. God was watching over me.\" Klein modestly stepped aside and invited Stuart in.\nWhat he said was the truth, and this matter did involve good luck. Long before Stuart had accepted the mission, he already knew of Emlyn White's whereabouts.\nStewart shivered as he took off his coat and hat and hung them on a rack in the hall.\n\"The darn weather is getting colder. Perhaps I should try using those coats with cotton stuffed inside them,\" he said.\n\"You can't call this cold, right? If you go to the north of Midseashire and live in Winter County for a day, you'll understand what truly low temperatures and true winter are like.\" Klein chuckled.\nThen, he generously asked, \"A cup of hot coffee?\"\n\"I would love one.\" Stuart followed him to the activity room on the first floor. \"I've been to north Midseashire, and I know about the cold and the snow there. It was a nice vacation, but Backlund's cold isn't inferior either. It went through my clothes like magic and seeped into my bones. Oh, what a wonderful fireplace!\"\nStuart stood in front of the burning fireplace for twenty seconds before he sat down on the sofa. He looked at Klein, who was busy brewing instant coffee, and he said, \"I'm going south for a holiday to go fishing at Desi Bay for new year's. What about you? Do you have any vacation plans? We put up with Backlund's air for a year and work hard to save money, all for such a holiday.\"\n\"Perhaps, I should head to Desi Bay as well...\" Klein said hesitantly. He turned his head to the side of Stuart's face, and for a moment, he seemed to be in a trance.\nThis involved an agreement.\nAn appointment with his elder brother, Benson, and sister, Melissa.\n\"Haha, I'll show you my fishing skills when the time comes.\" Stuart continued without end, \"We still aren't rich enough, otherwise I'd like to travel to Feysac, Intis, and even to the Southern Continent.\"\nAfter he finished making the coffee, Klein handed the man a white porcelain cup. He took two steps back and sat down across from him.\nHolding the cup in his hand, Stuart took two deep breaths of the fragrant and warm steam.\nAfter resting for a few seconds, he put the cup down and said very formally, \"According to our agreement, I'll share the reward I received this time with you.\n\"The Whites gave a total of fifty pounds, and you obviously did more than I did.\n\"Sherlock, how about thirty pounds? I still have to pay my informants for their work.\"\nOnly fifty pounds? A vampire is only worth fifty pounds?Klein couldn't help but silently lampoon.\nBut he also knew that it wasn't that the Whites didn't want to increase the bounty; it was because they were worried about giving too much money and scaring the detectives into making unnecessary associations, attracting the attention of the police or some official Beyonder organization.\nTo the average private detective, a fifty-pound mission was already tempting enough, and Klein had only used seven pounds back then to hire detectives to investigate all the red chimney houses in the whole of Tingen City and the towns along its outskirts.\n\"In addition, the Whites gave you an extra pound, claiming its for your transportation expenses for the past few days.\" Looking somewhat puzzled, Stuart produced six five-pound notes and one one-pound note.\nKlein reached out to take them, casually checked their authenticity and didn't explain the transportation fees.\nStuart didn't ask any further questions and instead said with a smile, \"Apart from Mr. Stanton, you're the best detective I've ever met. Did you join this profession midway, or have you studied under a great detective prior to this?\"\nWhat great detective have I studied under? There's quite a number. There's Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot, the forever elementary school\u00a0student1, and that guy who swindles others in the name of his\u00a0grandfather2...Klein silently lampooned.\nHe thought and said, \"I come from Midseashire, and I did various jobs before I became a detective.\"\n\"That's why you're so rich in knowledge and experience!\" Stuart said in enlightenment.\nHey, I'm a bit embarrassed by your flattery...Klein smiled but didn't respond.\nStuart took a sip of his coffee and said, \"Sherlock, I hope you can provide me with help in the future if I encounter a difficult case that I'm unable to solve.\"\nMy social connections in the detective circles have widened...Klein replied cautiously, \"If I have the time when the time comes.\"\nAfter some idle conversation, Stuart tactfully offered to take his leave, and Klein accompanied him to the door.\nAfter putting on his coat and hat, Stuart was about to open the door and leave when he suddenly turned around and sincerely said, \"Sherlock, you live too simply.\n\"Your talent deserves better coffee.\"\nAh?Klein was stunned for a moment, but then he immediately felt a bit embarrassed.\nHe laughed dryly and said, \"I can't tell the quality of the coffee. It's all the same to me.\"\n...\nAfter sending Stuart off, Klein went to the butcher's to buy a few ox bones and some beef. He went to the vegetable shop to buy some ingredients such as white radish, rounding up all the required condiments.\nHe wanted to prepare beef bone radish soup for dinner and eat it with the leftover rice. As for noon, he found a random restaurant on the streets and ate a small serving of lamb chop.\nAfter a leisurely afternoon, Klein continued to study the Book of Secrets, and the more he read, the more he realized that he knew little about mysticism.\nFortunately, he had a solid foundation. He quickly grasped many things once he came into contact with them and pondered over them.\nIn the evening, he smelled the tantalizing fragrance of the beef bone soup, and his Adam's apple bobbed up and down twice.\nHe heard the doorbell again, as though it was a bugle to signal dinner time.\nGulping down his saliva, Klein walked behind the door and reached for the handle.\nThe image of the visitor naturally appeared in his mind. It was the handsome but not masculine red-eyed vampire, Emlyn White.\nThere's no need to rush him at all... What a man of his word...Klein opened the door and smiled.\n\"Good evening, Mr. White\"\nEmlyn raised his chin, letting his impatience show in his expression.\nHe was about to say something when Klein looked at his brown clerical robes and said with a knowing smile, \"You just came over from the Harvest Church?\"\nWho was the one who said he could resist last night?\nUnable to maintain his gentlemanly demeanor, Emlyn gritted his teeth and said, \"That old man, that old man...\n\"Dammit, how do I get rid of this inducing suggestion?\"\nBefore Klein could reply, he patted the clothes on his chest and said with a stern face, \"Take me to the patient.\n\"There's a good dinner waiting for me.\"\nAs he spoke, he sniffed indiscernibly, as if he had smelled something.\nKlein picked up his coat and hat without saying another word.\n\"Alright, I'll take you there now.\"\nAfter closing the door and taking a few steps, he cautiously asked, \"Do you have a certificate to practice medicine?\"\nHow else am I supposed to convince Lawyer Jurgen to allow Mrs. Doris to take the medicine?\nEmlyn looked up at the sky at a forty-five-degree angle and said, \"I don't need those papers to prove my abilities.\"\nBefore Klein frowned, he casually added, \"It's too simple. I obtained it easily by going through the process.\"\n... This tone makes it sounds like he's rather proud of receiving a certificate for practicing medicine...Klein smiled without a word.\nLooking at the wet ground in front of him, Emlyn casually said, \"Do you know what I like most about Backlund?\"\n\"What?\" Klein responded without any curiosity.\nEmlyn chuckled and said, \"The persistent gloomy sky with fog that blots out the sun. This allows me to go out during the day without feeling too much discomfort.\n\"It's great, except for the air.\"\nIn other words, the sun really would deal certain damage to vampires? Fortunately, I thought of this yesterday and didn't bring the Sun Brooch with me; otherwise, I wouldn't be able to communicate with Emlyn...Klein seemed to gain an understanding.\nAs they conversed, they had already arrived outside the Jurgens, and Klein went up to ring the doorbell.\nAfter a while, the door opened, and Mrs. Doris, who was dressed thickly at home, said with pleasant surprise, \"Mr. Detective, I wasn't expecting you?\"\nBrody the black cat crouched to the side, looking at Emlyn warily, as though it felt that something was amiss about him.\nKlein pointed to the vampire beside him.\n\"I became acquainted with a doctor who's good at treating lung diseases, so I've asked him to come and give you a checkup. Let me do the introductions. This is Dr. Emlyn White.\"\n\"Is that so? You still actually remembered this? What a good child!\" Doris happily invited the two inside.\nChild...Klein's mouth twitched, but he didn't say anything in the end.\nOn the way into the living room, Emlyn whispered, \"The patient's problems are irreversible. She's very old and rather weak.\n\"Even if I give her the medicine, she would only be able to live through this winter. She would pass away in three to five years.\n\"Unless she's given an immortal potion or the like as spoken in the legends, that's all that can be done. Or should I turn her into a Sanguine? But at her age, she can no longer endure the changes a Beyonder characteristic can do to her body. Furthermore, my parents and I don't have any excess characteristics left.\"\nIrreversible...Klein was startled and silently sighed.\nHe said to Emlyn, \"Make her the medicine first. We'll leave that to after the winter.\"\n\"Alright, I have a type of ready-made medicine with me that's suitable for this kind of situation.\" Emlyn didn't stand on ceremony as he sat down on the sofa.\nAt that moment, Lawyer Jurgen was walking out of the kitchen as he took off his apron. He asked Klein about the purpose of his visit.\n\"Dr. White, what do you think of my grandmother's lung disease?\" Jurgen asked seriously.\nEmlyn was obviously very experienced in such situations. He first explained the ins and outs of lung disease, and after most of it flew past Jurgen's head, he said, \"What she needs most is warm and healthy air. That's my most sincere advice.\n\"In addition, I have special medicine that she can take for free.\"\nAs he spoke, he took out his certificate and a small metal bottle.\n\"Will there be any side effects?\" Jurgen asked cautiously.\n\"No, the only problem is that it can't cure the root of the problem completely; it's just a temporary cure,\" Emlyn replied in a very professional manner. \"If it weren't for Detective Moriarty, I wouldn't let anyone try it.\"\n\"Perhaps I can give it a try? Cough...\" Mrs. Doris interrupted.\nJurgen glanced at Klein who, having performed a divination prior to this, nodded affirmatively.\n\"Alright.\" Jurgen finally made his decision.\nHe watched warily as Mrs. Doris drank the bottle of medicine and carefully observed her reaction.\nThere wasn't much change to Mrs. Doris at first, but she gradually began to feel her breathing lighten.\nShe stood up and bent down to pick up the cat. She happily said, \"I feel much better!\"\nSeeing this scene, Jurgen's usually stoic face had his lips curl up slightly.\nHowever, Klein was thinking about the three to five years.\nHe curled a smile and sighed to himself.\nThis can also be considered a type of magic show, I guess. Using Beyonder powers to create fake outcomes to make the audience happy..."}
{"num_chp":655,"summary":"!\nKlein was alarmed. He instinctively turned his body to the side without exposing his back to Leomaster, who was trembling in horror in the storage room.\nHe couldn't be certain that the prisoner wearing a short linen robe wasn't problematic!\nAt this moment, the deep redness in the black-armored knight who had the same face as Leomaster brightened drastically. He raised up the gloomy broadsword in his hands.\nBam!\nWith a step forward, he cleaved forward at a speed that Klein couldn't capture with his naked eyes.\nAt the same time, Klein, who was standing to the side of him, subconsciously raised the Sea God Scepter and made the blue gems at its tip light up simultaneously.\nWhoosh!\nA corporeal hurricane appeared out of thin air as it swirled around Klein, protecting him within the eye of the hurricane.\nWhoosh!The black streams of light carved its way over as layer after layer of the strong winds dissipated, scattering in every direction, causing the entire hall to tremble.\nBoom!\nUnder the black broadsword, the hurricane produced an explosive boom and was reduced to a surging wave that flooded the entire region. It lifted up all the junk into the air.\nThe intense collision clearly shook the dream as Klein felt his mind go adrift. He couldn't help but roll twice.\nPlop!\nHe fell from his bed to the floor, the fall causing him to open his eyes.\nThat Saint of Darkness is really powerful... Or should I say that I've never used the Sea God Scepter in the real world, so I'm unable to replicate its full might in the dream... Wait! It's still night!Klein suddenly noticed a problem.\nAt that moment, the midday sunlight wasn't beaming in from the windows!\nHis awakening was due to the intense struggle in the dream, not due to a natural occurrence!\nThat also meant that he needed to sleep immediately; otherwise, he might very well disappear in the dark night, never to be found again!\nWith that thought flashing in his mind, Klein pushed his right hand to the ground, flipping his body up as he flew towards his bed and laid himself down.\nThen, he imagined the stacked spherical lights and quickly entered his dream.\nDuring this process, Klein swept his gaze to the window and vaguely saw the dark night outside. It was quiet and serene without any sense of sinisterness.\nMeanwhile, he vaguely felt that there was a fog encompassing the surface of the sea relatively far away. Amidst the fog, there was a cathedral composed of rather ancient architecture. It was completely black in color. There wasn't a bell tower, and at the top of it were pitch-black ravens spiraling around it as though they were consecrating or lamenting over something.\nThis cathedral has many buildings around it. There are ordinary two-story residences and simple wooden huts. There are bread shops with hanging signboards and grayish-white mills using waterwheels for power... Pedestrians pass through the main streets and alleys with their figures flitting about, impossible to know of their actual situations.\nA mirage? The source of the danger at night? All the people who disappeared had lost their minds and went somewhere?Klein woke up from his dreams because he subconsciously considered the questions that he had accumulated.\nFollowing that, he forcefully made himself concentrate. He retrieved the Sea God Scepter from the \"spirit world's unique zone!\"\nHe remembered that he was in an intense battle with the Saint of Darkness just before he left the dream!\nThe slightly dim golden light shone into Klein's eyes as everything immediately turned bright.\nWhat he could see was no longer the tall knight dressed in black full-bodied armor, nor was it Leomaster, who was dressed in a short linen robe. Instead, he was facing a floor-to-ceiling window that faced the setting sun.\nThe window was very clean and revealed an indescribable sense of purity under the sun's illumination.\nBy the side of the window were tables with their original wooden colors and black high-back chairs. Further away were rows of bookshelves with all kinds of books placed on them.\nA library? A book repository? Every time I enter this dream world, I'll be placed randomly in a certain area?Klein carefully observed his surroundings and confirmed that it was temporarily safe without the so-called Saint of Darkness or strange evil creatures.\nHe held the Sea God Scepter and first came to the floor-to-ceiling window and looked at the environment outside.\nThe first thing that he saw was the opulent buildings that covered the opposite mountain peak. The huge palaces, magnificent steeples, and the towering city walls that all appeared frozen in the sunset. It was a visual spectacle.\nEven though it wasn't his first time seeing it, Klein still held his breath, quietly admiring this miraculous scenery for a few seconds.\nHe then moved his gaze away towards the cliff. He saw the high walls of the black cloister and the withered trees beside the boulders. But as they were blocked, it was impossible to confirm whether Cattleya remained in her original spot.\nIndeed, within a certain radius, it's not possible to leave this region... I'm deep inside the black cloister?Klein retracted his gaze in thought as he walked to the bookshelves.\nHe temporarily didn't have the time to consider what happened between the Saint of Darkness and Leomaster in his previous dream. This was because he needed to determine his current situation.\nWhen he arrived by the bookshelves, Klein discovered that the books placed on them had their own names. They weren't blurry and indistinct like ordinary dreams.\nThe Spirituality of Life, Book of Charms, The Flower Within the Heart, The True Cosmos and Inner Universe... These are all books on mysticism...Klein carefully reached out and took out the Book of Charms.\nHe quickly flipped through it and realized that he knew most of the content, but there was a small portion which he had never come into contact with.\nIt can be confirmed that this isn't from my dream... Ma'am Hermit's? The knowledge that pursues her and is injected into her has been conjured in this black cloister?Klein had no desire to explore beyond where he was. He held the Book of Charms and returned to the side of the floor-to-ceiling window. He found a spot to sit down and began reading in a serious manner with the sunset's glow.\nYou can still study even in dreams!As he lampooned, he took out a pen and paper as he wrote and drew.\nWhile he was engrossed in this, the light suddenly bloomed as blinding whiteness blanketed his vision.\nKlein naturally opened his eyes and felt warmth from the sunlight that shone inwards.\nI just read a few pages and planned to speed read it before using dream divination to recall them...Klein sat up, frustrated. He felt like he had lost a good opportunity to study. This was because he couldn't determine if he would be randomly placed in the black cloister's library again.\nHe straightened his hair, wore his cap, and went to the deck. As he observed his surroundings, he recalled the dream.\nThat prison is likely inside the black cloister as well. Yes, it might be underground. In other words, the Saint of Darkness and Leomaster are in a ruin nearby.\nIt's no wonder that Will Auceptin told me not to attempt exploring the dream. These places are really filled with danger!\nWhy would the Saint of Darkness and Leomaster look identical? That dream was a little strange. Also, that full-body mirror was very magical and sinister. It actually managed to clone a Gehrman Sparrow...\nUpon recalling this, Klein began to find examples from his past experiences to confirm his through processes by comparison.\nThis was called relying on experience.\nSoon, he thought of something. He had once borrowed the Mental Terror Candle in Backlund and helped Father Utravsky eliminate the \"past him.\" A character that was dissociated from his original self!\nCould it be that Leomaster is the Saint of Darkness from the Aurora Order?\nDue to certain reasons, he had split his personality, separating his good and evil sides? That sealed and dark prison is the reflection of his inner dream?\nYes, that full-bodied mirror! Leomaster had said that if it were destroyed, he would vanish as well. When I looked into the mirror, the Gehrman Sparrow inside it did form a corporeal body. It was evil!\nIt's no wonder I felt like a sage after I eliminated the Gehrman Sparrow in the mirror. It's because I got rid of my evil and sinister thoughts in my mind...\nYes, that full-body mirror must be in the form of a mirror in the real world... These waters clearly have the Beyonder remains of a Visionary. It conjures many unreal and real monsters that can kill... And this belongs to the Spectator pathway; therefore, being able to split good from evil and causing dissociated personalities does make logical sense...\nHeh heh, Saint of Darkness Leomaster is a high-ranking member of the Aurora Order. He must originally be very evil, but that ruin or item stirred up his inverse side, which is the good hidden deep in his heart. It caused a split personality; hence, he is trapped somewhere nearby.Klein felt that he had roughly understood the truth to the matter and felt a little regret.\nUnfortunately, I'm unable to enter the same spot a second time. Otherwise, with the Sea God Scepter and Leomaster's good side, there's a high chance of defeating his evil side, the Saint of Darkness. And the damage dealt in the dream world would continue on in the real world...\nIn that case, a good saint who understands the Aurora Order would be born. It will make it easier to strike down on this cultist organization...Klein silently sighed and turned halfway around and watched Anderson Hood walk out of the cabin.\n\"Where did you go in the dream? I didn't actually find you,\" the Strongest Hunter asked as though they were best buds.\nKlein secretly frowned as he asked, \"Why should I be seen by you?\"\nAnderson was taken aback.\n\"Shouldn't you return to the spot where you left the dream upon returning there again?\"\n... There are other elements involved in my random appearance in other spots within a particular radius? Something to do with my uniqueness?Klein realized that the problem was more complex than he had imagined.\nHe said with some deliberation, \"I went elsewhere after entering the dream.\"\n\"Strange...\" Anderson frowned as though he was very puzzled.\nWithout waiting for Klein to speak, he thought before speaking again, \"There's another strange incident.\"\n\"What?\" Klein asked cooperatively.\nAnderson surveyed his surroundings.\n\"Back when I was pretending to make a canoe in the hall last time, I heard the sounds of a door opening and of footsteps that came out from deep inside. But when I looked up, I found nothing.\n\"I originally thought that it was someone from the ship, but later it didn't seem like the case.\""}
{"num_chp":442,"summary":"Alger looked at Fors and returned with a question.\n\"You were forced to drink a second Apprentice potion?\"\nWhy did you figure it out so easily... It's as though you were there to see it...Fors uncomfortably cleared her throat and said, \"Yes, let's just pretend that's what happened...\n\"What solutions do you have? What do you need me to exchange for it?\"\nAlger glanced at Mr. Fool, but seeing that he had nothing to say, he replied in a calm and low voice, \"You don't need payment, because it will certainly not be able to satisfy your needs.\"\nWithout waiting for Miss Magician and Miss Justice to ask, he casually explained, \"High-Sequence Beyonders can independently decide whether or not to pass on their Beyonder characteristics to their descendants, and how much they will inherit as a result. Sequence 6 and Sequence 5 will naturally pass a part of it in an uncontrollable manner. Although the quantity isn't a lot each time and wouldn't affect the Beyonder's strength, their Sequence will regress if they have enough children.\"\n\"Such a child is born with high spiritual perception and a certain level of incomplete Beyonder powers?\" Audrey suddenly came to a realization, understanding the origins of some special people.\nThe Hanged Man nodded.\n\"Yes, they're equivalent to half a Sequence 9, with a certain amount of characteristics. If they want to become a Beyonder, they can only choose the corresponding path. Of course, such people might not be a result of inheritance. It might be the result of them gaining the blessings of a deity or the corruption of an evil spirit. There are many factors that can cause the same degree of influence. Also, when High-Sequence Beyonders have children, they might give birth to someone who's already at Sequence 5. This is one of the rare instances when one can advance without losing control.\nSo that's how it is...Audrey sighed with satisfaction.\nTo her, knowing more mysteries was more enjoyable than getting a nice dress or jewelry.\nFors also came to a realization as she pressed, \"Then what about Beyonders at Sequence 7, 8, and 9?\"\n\"Theoretically speaking, their Beyonder characteristics will not be passed down to their descendants, but that is not absolute. If there's an excessive amount of Beyonder characteristics, there's a chance for them to be passed down as well. That is to say, if you're pregnant with a child, there's a way to effectively reduce the remnant potion in your body. No, one might not succeed, but three or four will stand a higher chance.\"\nThree or four?Fors stared agape.\nKlein, who had learned all of this general knowledge from Roselle's diary, couldn't help but think of a joke.\nMiss Magician, in the future, you can say to your child that \"you were a free\u00a0gift1from drinking a potion!\"\nAlthough it seems that, according to Mr. Hanged Man, the burden can be reduced the moment a child is conceived, having a child would still require almost forty weeks of trouble. No, more than that, it's impossible to leave the child after it's born, right... After grasping the acting method, even if the process subsequently becomes more difficult, two months will definitely be enough time to digest it. It might not even take that long; after all, it's just a starting Sequence...Fors forced a smile and said, \"I understand, the best way is still to rely on acting to digest it.\"\nAlger gave an affirmative answer. \"That's the case for Sequence 7 and below.\"\nAfter that, digestion would easily take a year or so, two to three years, and then five to six years. When that happens, giving birth to a child would be a simpler plan...he added inwardly.\nThere were a few seconds of silence as the two women digested the knowledge they had just gained.\nThis was the first time they had known that having a child had such uses.\nFor Derrick, this was common knowledge. He adjusted his posture and said, \"I've been assigned another exploration mission.\"\n\"Where to?\" Alger tilted his head and asked.\n\"It's still the half-destroyed temple of the Fallen Creator,\" Derrick answered without sounding too grave.\nIt sounds like there's a certain guaranteed level of safety...Audrey didn't interrupt.\nThe Hanged Man pondered for two seconds before asking, \"Is the Shepherd Elder still in prison?\"\n\"Yes. This exploration will be led by the Chief.\" The Sun didn't hide the facts.\n\"This way, the danger level will be much lower than last time. You can give it a try.\" Alger couldn't help but look at Mr. Fool once more.\nUnable to read any thoughts from the other party's blurry eyes, he continued to speak to The Sun.\n\"This should be your last inspection before the surveillance is completely removed.\n\"Previously, the information you made known was that Amon is archenemies with the Fallen Creator. They wouldn't mind exposing themselves to spoil the other's plans. This time, by heading to the Fallen Creator's temple for exploration, as long as you don't reveal any abnormalities, the six-member council will basically determine that you're no longer under Amon's influence.\"\nMr. Hanged Man sure is experienced. It's as if he was planning the operation...Derrick kept it in mind before asking, \"What else do I need to pay attention to?\"\nAt the very end of the long bronze table, The Fool, who was quietly watching, opened his mouth.\n\"Flesh and blood, ravings.\"\nKlein had only said two words, leaving the Tarot Club members to comprehend them on their own.\nThis was the demeanor of a great figure.\nThe Hanged Man pondered for a few seconds, then he said to The Sun who had thanked The Fool, \"In particular, don't look at what you shouldn't, don't listen to what you shouldn't, don't eat what you shouldn't, and don't touch what you shouldn't.\"\n\"What are those that shouldn't be seen or heard?\" Derrick asked, puzzled.\nThe Hanged Man said with a deepened voice, \"After entering the temple, everything is included.\"\n\"Then, how should I explore?\" Derrick asked in surprise.\nThe Hanged Man chuckled.\n\"Aren't there other members? Isn't there a Chief?\"\nIt really is Mr. Hanged Man's style...Audrey subconsciously wanted to cover her face with her hands, but the education and habits ingrained in her had told her that such actions weren't graceful, so she forcefully changed the way she moved, stroking her drooping hair and pushing it behind her ears.\n\"...\" The Sun felt that such a method was quite unacceptable.\nUpon noticing his reaction, Alger secretly cursed before saying, \"What I mean is to listen to your Chief's instructions. Only do what he allows you to do. At any other times, do not take matters into your own hands.\"\n\"I understand. Thank you, Mr. Hanged Man.\" The Sun instantly relaxed.\nPhew.Alger exhaled and turned to the woman opposite him.\n\"Miss Justice, I wish to know the political changes in Backlund after Duke Negan's passing.\"\nAudrey recalled the information she had heard, both directly and indirectly in recent times.\n\"Duke Negan's death has divided the House of Lords. Although his eldest son is about to inherit the nobility title and become a member of the House of Lords, his prestige isn't enough to calm the dispute.\n\"Nearly ten members of the House of Lords have jointly proposed that the newly conferred nobility should also have a chance to obtain a fixed seat as a Member of Parliament.\n\"Simply put, let those who are conferred nobility through political donations, charity donations, and the purchase of land become members of the House of Lords.\"\nHearing this, The Hanged Man Alger laughed.\n\"Aren't nobles with a certain amount of history in their family line the ones who despise such people who rely on unorthodox means to be conferred a nobility title the most? Wasn't the ultimate honor and their greatest pride the fact that a fixed seat in the House of Lords was hereditary?\"\nIgnoring the inadvertent mockery, Audrey calmly explained, \"When you have tens of thousands of pounds, hundreds of thousands of pounds, or even more debts, you will also make the same choice.\"\nOwing money wasn't a fatal threat to many nobles, but the debtor could apply to the court and use their lands as payment for the debts. Without the minimum amount of land needed for a noble title, their status as nobles would be on the verge of collapse.\n\"And then?\" Alger didn't continue to harp over the previous question.\nAudrey gave a rough description. \"This kind of dispute has put many bills on hold, including, but not limited to, the raising of worker salary, the improvement of working hours, and revising the Poor Law. It's gratifying to see that the Civil Servant Unified Examination is still progressing steadily and hasn't stopped, and the investigation into the air pollution in Backlund is also going in depth.\"\n\"There will be no war for the time being....\" The Hanged Man whispered, and he went on to talk to the other members.\nWorried that staying too long in the bathroom would arouse suspicion, Klein announced the end of the Tarot Gathering after they were done.\n...\nAfter returning to her room, Audrey didn't rush to get up. She first quietly sorted out the things she needed to do after this.\nLooking at the mirror in front of her, she played with the accessories on her earlobes. With a slight smile, she silently muttered to herself,There will be a psychology lesson tomorrow afternoon. I can tell Miss Escalante that I've met someone in a Beyonder circle who's looking to buy the Human-skinned Shadow characteristic and has promised an abnormally generous price for it. I wonder if the Psychology Alchemists will be interested in it or not...\nAlso, I mustn't forget Roselle's diary and the Wind-blessed formula...\nYes, I have to find the Psychiatrist ingredients as quickly as possible. Audrey, you can't be lazy! Susie is already a Sequence 8, so you can't let her overtake you!\n...\nAfter pacing back and forth in the room, Fors finally made up her mind and pulled out her chair.\nShe grabbed a piece of paper and a pen and, after mulling over it for nearly a minute, began to write to Dorian Gray.\nShe described how she learned of someone who requested the characteristic of a Human-skinned Shadow and the Wind-blessed potion formula, as well as her curiosity over the Roselle notebook.\n...\nThe capital of the Rorsted Archipelago, the City of Generosity.\nAlger Wilson walked out of the hotel and headed for a secret underground market.\nHis target was the hair of a Deep-sea Naga.\nHe had no intention of missing a Human-skinned Shadow if someone had it.\n...\nI'm short on money...Klein sat in the living room and sighed again.\nHe still needed quite a bit of cash to ensure that he could purchase the items directly when he received clues regarding the Human-skinned Shadow's characteristics.\nKlein thought for a long time, wondering if he should find other channels to sell the Beyonder characteristic left by the Interrogator and stop waiting for Miss Xio to save up her money.\nAfter an unknown period of time, the sound of the doorbell rang, breaking the afternoon silence."}
{"num_chp":377,"summary":"Putting down his dark red fountain pen, Klein picked up the piece of paper with the divination statement and leaned back in his chair.\nHis lips moved as he whispered, \"Capim's dinner time today,\" over and over again.\nKlein's voice echoed above the empty gray fog as his eyes rapidly turned dark, and his eyelids drooped.\nIn a fragmented dreamscape, he saw the spacious, elegant dining room where there was gilded porcelain cutlery, caviar, roasted chicken, lamb stew, fried rib eye steak, deep-fried Dragon-Bone Fish, thick creamy soup, and so on.\nThe food was placed in a certain order according to specific requests in front of several diners. Among them was the slightly plump Capim; the middle-aged gentleman in a white hood, Harras; the thin-bloused Katy; and Parker, whose face was rather unintimidating due to his old age.\nLooking out from the end of the dining table, he could see a window decorated with gorgeous decorations. Outside the window, the clouds were sparse, and the crimson moon was faintly discernible in the air.\nKlein opened his eyes and marked the location of the moon in his dream. Using his knowledge in astromancy, he quickly calculated a rough corresponding time.\nIt looks like it's from 7:30 to 7:45 in the evening... Considering those few scenes, Capim and the others have already finished more than half their meals, so I can push the time back by another 15 minutes. That way, 7:30 is the best choice...Klein muttered silently to himself as he interpreted the revelation from his dream divination.\nEating at half past seven was not a rare occurrence. This was even considered mainstream in the Loen Kingdom and even the Northern Continent because many middle-class people-either due to their personal situations or because of low rent-lived in the suburbs and had to commute to work by taking the short-distance steam locomotive. By the time they got home, it was usually after seven in the evening, so it was normal for people to have dinner between 7:30 and 8:00.\nKlein had had the same experience in Tingen City, but that was because he had no servants and no housewife. Once the three siblings returned home, they still needed to busy themselves for quite a while before they could enjoy any hot food. It wasn't because they lived far from work.\nThis was why civilians and the poor often had dinner between 7:30 and 8:00.\nAs lunch and dinner were separated by quite some time, afternoon tea, which should've belonged to the upper-class citizens, became popular among the middle-class citizens and civilians.\nWhen he finished the interpretation, Klein recalled the revelation he had just received. Klein became acutely aware of a problem:Where were Capim's wife and children?\nThey didn't appear in the dining room... Is Capim an extreme believer in the Lord of Storms, so his wife and children have to eat their meals in the activity room? Or is there another reason? Or could he be unmarried and childless? He's already a middle-aged man...Klein tried to divine the situation, but he failed to receive any effective revelations, so he gave up.\n7:30.He repeated the time once more before returning to the real world.\n...\nIn the evening, even at home, Capim, who was wearing a formal bow tie, narrowed his eyes and looked at his subordinates before him. He asked in a slow but chilling voice, \"Fabian is dead?\"\n\"Yes, Boss.\" Even though he had been working with Capim for many years, his subordinate still felt fear and horror.\n\"Odysseus, call me Mister. Mister. In a few years, you'll have to call me Sir Capim.\" Capim loosened his bow tie and casually handled a thick cigar. \"When did Fabian die? How did he die?\"\n\"This afternoon, I sent him to East Borough to do something. He ended up in a conflict with the Zmanger gang and got stabbed in the neck...\" Odysseus described in a trembling voice.\nCapim, who was toasting the cigar, said in an unperturbed tone, \"Fabian is really a fool.\n\"But are the Zmanger gang fools to not know that he's my subordinate?\"\n\"Mister, as you know, highlanders often join the Zmanger gang when they arrive in East Borough, and they're barbaric and reckless, and they don't give a shit who's who,\" Odysseus quickly explained.\nCapim snorted.\n\"Have they forgotten that this isn't the highlands? Or have they forgotten who I am?\n\"Odysseus, I want the body of the Zmanger gang's leader from that block. Can you do it? If you can't, I'll sink your wife, your child, as well as you into the Tussock River.\"\n\"Mister, no problem!\" Odysseus immediately raised his voice.\nHe immediately asked in a low voice, \"Who can I mobilize?\"\nCapim was about to reply when the door suddenly opened and the middle-aged gentleman with a white wig, Harras, walked in.\nHe gave Odysseus a cold glance before casting his gaze onto Capim.\n\"I heard that one of your subordinates had a conflict with a gang in East Borough and ended up dying?\"\n\"Yes, Mr. Harras.\" Capim stood up, cigar in hand.\nHarras stared into Capim's eyes and said, \"You want revenge on them?\"\nCapim's forehead suddenly dripped with beads of sweat.\n\"No, not at all. Mr. Harras, you misunderstand.\"\nHarras nodded slightly. \"You have to remember that during this critical period, we have to try our best to not cause any trouble unless necessary.\"\nHe paused for a second and observed Capim's reaction.\n\"You are not the only human trafficker in Backlund. We can support you, but we can also do so for others. You have to remember this point.\n\"The reason why I picked you was because you were vicious and shameless enough. However, you were extremely cautious. It wasn't because you were the biggest human trafficker.\"\nFrom the side, Odysseus listened to the duo's conversation. He wished that he was just a mass of air. That way, he didn't need to see how humble his boss, Capim, was.\nWithout a trace of anger on his face, Capim smiled and said, \"Mr. Harras, my main concern is that Fabian's death isn't simple. It might disrupt your plans.\"\n\"No, there's nothing wrong with his death,\" Harras said in an affirmative tone. \"I didn't get any feedback.\"\n\"Is that so...\" Capim acted enlightened. \"Then I'm relieved.\"\nHe looked at Odysseus and signaled him to leave. He then lowered his voice and said, \"Mr. Harras, this time, there are the kind of goods you like from this batch.\"\nSeeing Harras's expression soften but not show any signs of emotion, Capim quickly added, \"We've already finished gathering the ones that will be sent over.\"\nHarras nodded slowly.\n\"Send her to my room tonight.\"\n\"Yes, Mr. Harras!\" Capim said with a big smile.\nAfter Harras left, his face turned gloomy. He took a deep breath and whispered, \"I hope that you can keep your promise this time... I don't want to be involved in anything like that anymore!\"\nHe clearly remembered that year during the Harvest Festival-someone had come to him, hoping to get a batch of innocent girls.\nFrom that day on, the trajectory of his life had undergone tremendous changes. He had taken a fifth of the market share of the unlawful slave trade.\nHe quickly became one of Backlund's rather famous tycoons, acquainting himself with several important figures and dragging them into the abyss of depravity.\nAt this point, he desperately wanted to cover up the sins of his past. He wanted to let \"Capim\" undergo a catharsis, allowing him to become a true member of the upper-class. However, for the time being, he was unable to do so.\nGlancing at the cigar in his hand, he picked up the framed photograph of himself with a beautiful woman and two children.\nRubbing the surface of the photo frame with his thumb, Capim narrowed his eyes and whispered to himself,After this deal, you should be able to return...\nAt dinner time, Capim walked out of his study, a warm smile plastered over his face again.\n\"Ma'am Katy, there's your favorite caviar and a roast chicken specially prepared for you this evening,\" he said to the woman in the thin blouse.\nKaty touched the old scar on her face and nodded without saying a word.\nCapim knew that she was silent and fierce, so he didn't continue. He watched her as she took her seat.\nThen Harras, wearing a white wig, entered the dining room, nodding slightly to each of the diners.\nThe elderly Parker took a sip of his pre-meal wine, smiling as he motioned for Capim to sit down.\nThe white napkins were spread out, and the food was served one by one. Capim raised his glass and chuckled.\n\"Holy Lord of Storms, let's toast to a beautiful future.\"\n\"To a beautiful future,\" Parker responded.\nHarras didn't say a word. He merely held the wine glass in his hand and made a gesture. Katy completely ignored them.\nAt this moment, the classical clock hanging in the hall read 7:23.\n...\nIn a cheap hotel in the Backlund Bridge area.\nThe disguised Klein took out his golden pocket watch, looked at the exact time, then he took out Holy Night Powder, and he sealed the room with a wall of spirituality.\nAfter doing that, he quickly set up an altar and conducted a ritual.\n\"I!\"\n\"I summon in my name:\n\"The Fool that doesn't belong to this era, the mysterious ruler above the gray fog; the King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck.\"\n...\nWhen the ritual was over, Klein immediately took four steps counterclockwise and went above the gray fog, ready to respond to himself.\nInside the towering and solemn palace, he saw the Door of Summoning condensed by rippling light. It was a pair of illusory doors that opened outwards, covered with mysterious symbols.\nKlein was in no hurry to be summoned. Instead, he took out the Sun Brooch and other mystical items, and he absorbed them into his Spirit Body according to his plan.\nFinally, he picked up the Dark Emperor card and let his Spirit Body envelop it.\nAll of a sudden, Klein felt as if his Spirit Body had turned corporeal with flesh and blood. It was as if he could lift a gun and move a table and chair!\nA dark and ethereal mist rose up around him, and as the mist clung onto the surface of his body, it formed an imposing set of armor.\nHe had a black crown on his head and a long cape of the same color on his back.\nAt that moment, Klein was like an emperor about to embark on a journey.\nDark Emperor.\nHe examined the purifying bullets and revolver that he didn't bring with him before taking a step forward and entering the crack on the illusory door.\nLeaping out of the candlelight, he immediately flew under the cover of the night towards Capim's villa on Iris Street in Cherwood Borough.\nNot long after, he floated in front of the artificial fountain and approached the villa's entrance at a relaxed pace. The patrolling guards passed by him, but they didn't have any reaction. Since it wasn't really late into the night yet, there were no Beyonders on guard outside.\nIn addition, Klein wasn't afraid that the powerful Beyonders inside would notice and have a premonition.\nIt was because the Dark Emperor card possessed anti-divination and anti-prophecy characteristics!"}
{"num_chp":217,"summary":"Mr. Door... This naming style is very similar to mine... I wonder what was the real name of this pathetic fellow who was lost and trapped in the deep darkness amidst the storms is, and what his Sequence is. Or rather, just as Emperor Roselle had guessed, he's one of the evil gods or devils...Klein let out a silent chuckle which was mixed with ridicule and self-deprecating humor. He was also interested in the history of the Fourth Epoch.\n\"I know of the most famous \u2018War of the Four Emperors' in the Fourth Epoch, but the specific details and the main figures involved are limited to the information spread by the major Churches. For example, the \u2018Dark Emperor' of the Solomon Empire.\n\"It wasn't until today that this so-called Mr. Door finally answered my questions by letting me know who the remaining three emperors are. The half-insane Blood Emperor of the Tudor Dynasty, the Night Emperor of the Trunsoest Empire, and the Emperor of the Underworld of the Southern Continent, also known as Death.\n\"According to Mr. Door's description, in this war that changed the situation of the entire world, the Dark Emperor, Blood Emperor and Night Emperor fell one after another. The Emperor of the Underworld reaped the greatest benefits.\n\"Having said that, Mr. Door added with profound significance that after over a century of \u2018digestion,' Death went mad, but he also became stronger. Therefore, Death teamed up with the Primordial Demoness and brought about a Pale Disaster for the Northern Continent. Of course, this isn't something he witnessed personally, but rather something that he hears when he comes close to the real world every month.\n\"Death went mad, but also became stronger!\n\"Even deities can go mad?\n\"What a horrifying sentence!\n\"However, this also confirms my guess. Before the Fifth Epoch, those deities would often descend into the real world, directly interfering with the situation in the Northern and Southern Continents. They might even personally appear just like Death.\n\"I asked Mr. Door if he had participated in the \u2018War of the Four Emperors'? If so, what role did he play? And what was the position the seven deities maintained in this war? What role did they play?\n\"Mr. Door didn't answer my question. He only said in a teasing manner that the number of pre-eminent mighty figures in the Fourth Epoch far exceeds my imagination.\n\"In addition, he also mentioned two laws, one is the Law of Beyonder Characteristics Indestructibility, and the other is the Law of Similar Sequence Beyonder Characteristics Conservation, which is consistent with certain things that I have learned from that most secret and ancient organization, and also from some of the phenomena I have observed. Heh, this can lead to many interesting conclusions, making many explanations take on other forms, making one's mind tremble in horror. For example, when there are too many High-Sequence Beyonders in the same Sequence pathway, the Low-Sequence Beyonders would reduce, and vice-versa.\n\"... The Beyonder Characteristics had been fixed at the source. It will not increase or decrease. Does this mean that there really is a God who created all the deities, an omnipotent and omniscient God, and everything originated from Him?\"\nThis was the longest Roselle diary that Klein had ever seen. It took up two full pages, and one could imagine that it originally came on a double-sided page. It only became two separate pages after repeated copying.\nThat's a lot of information...Klein sighed silently.\nAs a history student who had graduated normally, he had always believed that the Solomon Empire, the Tudor Dynasty, and the Trunsoest Empire came one after the other in a line, with a certain degree of restoration before a new political outcome was established. To his surprise, the War of the Four Emperors described by Mr. Door clearly and unambiguously revealed one thing-all three empires had existed at the same time!\nIf this were true, then it would really overturn most of the current research on the Fourth Epoch in the field of history. Klein suddenly thought of the original Klein, who was filled with interest towards archeology and the history regarding the Fourth Epoch.\nToday, I've helped him achieve his wish... I wonder if Death had already become a true deity during the War of the Four Emperors. It's hard to determine according to Mr. Door's descriptions. I can only first assume that the Emperor of the Underworld, who had obtained benefits from the War of the Four Emperors, had broken through his limits and become a deity, but \"He\" also went mad as a result...\nTo have a deity go mad was truly terrifying. Just thinking about the details makes one tremble from the bottom of their heart! It's no wonder that the knowledgeable Emperor Roselle would use the word \"horrifying\" to describe this matter...\nCould it be that the so-called evil gods were crazy orthodox deities?\nWould that mean that there might only be evil gods left in this world one day...\nMan, does this mean that the end of days cannot be stopped?\nKlein smiled to hide the growing solemnity of his emotions. He felt that the future he imagined was filled with a dark gray hue.\nAt the same time, he raised his evaluation of the Dark Emperor, Blood Emperor, and Night Emperor, believing them to be the pre-eminent mighty figures who were close to being deities.\nPerhaps that means Sequence 1 is the peak existence of a single pathway. According to this logic, for Dark Emperor to live for centuries or over a millennium wouldn't be unacceptable. That would explain the original Klein's confusion. He had obtained contradictory findings from the content recorded in the Antigonus family's notebook with his own mentor's viewpoint. He believed that the Dark Emperor was the common name used by every emperor of the Solomon Empire... Perhaps, the Dark Emperor had always been the same Dark Emperor... Of course, other possibilities cannot be eliminated. For example, they could've been replaced two or three times, but is the name of that pathway's Sequence 1, Dark Emperor?\nI wonder who Mr. Door is in the history of the Fourth Epoch... Emperor Roselle didn't go into detail when describing his erroneous experiments and accidental coincidences, making it impossible for me to even try to converse with that Mr. Door.\nThe Laws of Beyonder Characteristics Indestructibility and Similar Sequence Beyonder Characteristics Conservation shares the same description as the one used by the Captain. Perhaps, the term he used came from Emperor Roselle.\nAccording to the two laws described by Mr. Gate, we can indeed deduce a lot of interesting speculations. For example, with there being so many holy artifacts and High-Sequence Beyonders in the Seven Churches, there shouldn't be many Low-Sequence Beyonders. But this contradicts reality, and the only reasonable explanation is an additional gift from the deities?\nFor example, is the destruction of the Nation of the Evernight due to the Conservation of Characteristics, that the mere possession of resources causes it to be in trouble? Or could it be said that their existence seriously weakens the potency of the Evernight pathway and threatens the position of the Goddess?\nFor example, theoretically speaking, certain Sealed Artifacts could also be used as the main ingredients for potion materials, or they can even be considered equivalent to potions. Of course, the prerequisite is to remove all latent dangers and madness.\n...\nNo wonder the documents that were unearthed called the Fourth Epoch, \"the Epoch of the Gods.\" So it turns out that in this epoch, there are many records of deities descending.\nThen what caused them to stop coming, to the point of there not being any revelations?\nIf it wasn't for the fact that Beyonders receive responses from ritualistic magic, perhaps many of them would've doubted the existence of the deities...\nMany ideas came to Klein suddenly as he felt that he had delved deeper into the realm of mysticism in this Beyonder world.\nHe flipped through the next four pages and was disappointed to realize that they were no longer related to Mr. Door.\nHis ability as a Clown allowed him to conceal his emotions well, and coupled with the gray fog's obstruction, even Audrey, who was secretly observing him, didn't notice anything amiss.\nHe gathered his chaotic thoughts and started reading the third page of the diary:\n\"10th September. I've endured it for a long time, but I still can't help but complain a little.\n\"I must've had f**king sh*t for brains to chose the Savant path, right?\n\"Of course, this has indeed allowed me to develop my greatest advantage, allowing the Church to attach great importance to me. But the problem is that the first few Sequences lack any Beyonder powers needed for combat. I can only make do by relying on mystical items and rely way too much on external items.\n\"For example, Sequence 9 Savant only has extraordinary abilities in memory, learning, and practical skills. For example, Sequence 8 Archaeologist gains a strong physique and corresponding ancient knowledge, and they can only barely apply some ritualistic magic. For example, Sequence 7 Appraiser, whose ability is to quickly identify mystical objects, allowing them to avoid hidden dangers to the greatest extent. For example, Sequence 6 Artisan, who can produce machinery wonder but not very powerful Beyonder objects. Apart from that, one's standard in ritualistic magic will be enhanced. It's no wonder its modern name is Machinery Specialist.\n\"Comparatively speaking, the Sequence 7 Warlock and Sequence 6 Scrolls Professor of the Mystery Pryer pathway are sufficiently tempting. It would be great if only the Church has the complete Sequence and that the Hidden Sage doesn't exist.\n\"However, I finally received some good news. After I advance again, I'll gain Beyonder powers combat powers that I can call my own. Sequence 5 Astromancer!\n\"Its modern name scares me a little. It's actually called Astronomer...\n\"Am I going to end up as an all-powerful mad scientist?\n\"Heavens have mercy on me. I was only a second-tier student at the college entrance examination!\nIt had to be said that Emperor Roselle had a strange talent for making jokes. Even the recently dispirited Klein couldn't help but twitch his mouth, wishing to light a candle for this senior.\nStudy hard and improve by the day is indeed a wise saying...He lampooned and remembered the unique trait of the Church of the God of Steam and Machinery.\nThey lacked Beyonder powers when it came to combat, but they were good at making and using items.\nAfter flipping to the third page of the diary, Klein continued reading.\n\"2nd June, the kingdom has created chaos, again and again, instigating wars without being able to completely destroy the Feysac Empire, the Loen Kingdom, and the Feynapotter Kingdom. As such, the kingdom has no choice but to shoulder huge debts, and its economy is on the verge of collapse.\n\"From my observations, the people, merchants, and soldiers are very dissatisfied. The riots are just lacking a spark! This is my chance.\n\"But I have to be very careful. The Sauron family has witnessed the history of the Fourth Epoch and is an ancient family with a high possibility of having High-Sequence Beyonders. I need the support of the Church, as well as gain a tacit agreement with the Church of the Eternal Blazing Sun.\n\"I can't appear immediately. First, I'll let the rebels destroy order before I end it all as a protector. Consul Roselle Gustav. I like that name.\""}
{"num_chp":351,"summary":"After a full half hour of uninterrupted silence, Klein opened his eyes and slowly rose to his feet.\nHe took his cane, put on his hat, and left the cathedral, taking a rental carriage back to Minsk Street in the dark.\nAt this moment, the vigilance and surveillance of the surrounding area had inevitably relaxed, turning into the shadows under the light of the gas lamps.\nShortly after midnight, Klein took out his key, opened the door to his house, and entered the empty guest rooms to search for the Book of Secrets.\nIt didn't take him much effort to find the old book, bound in thick goatskin, in the wardrobe in a room on the first floor.\nThe hardcover of the book was dark black, with two lines of Hermes written in crimson:\n\"Book of Secrets.\n\"Klarman.\"\nPhew...Klein exhaled but was in no rush to read the book. Instead, he quickly constructed a wall of spirituality in the room, summoning and responding to himself via a ritual, and then he threw Azik's copper whistle, the Master Key, the All-Black Eye, the Beyonder bullets, the bottle of biological poison, the Werewolf Beyonder characteristic, the Book of Secrets, and even all the vessels above the gray fog. He planned on waiting for the commotion to subside before deciding on which to take out and which to carry.\nAfter doing all this, he didn't even bother to study the Werewolf Beyonder characteristic or the bottle of biological poison. He simply washed up and laid in bed.\nThere were two reasons for doing so. Firstly, reading the book was too time consuming. It was very easy to bring trouble to his body in the real world on this rather uncalm night. Secondly, Klein was aware of his current weakness, which was that the speed at which his spirituality was growing wasn't enough to satisfy his ever-increasing Beyonder powers and mystical items.\nAfter such an intense battle, his spirituality was already drained. His head was aching, and he was drowsy.\nYes, the one thing that places the greatest burden on my spirituality are the Paper Figurine Substitutes, followed by the creation of \"Sun Holy Water\" with the Sun Brooch, but it wasn't used tonight. Next in the list is Holy Water Creation and Flaming Jump...Klein yawned and used Cogitation to get rid of the state of extreme tiredness and tenseness that prevented him from falling asleep.\nIn less than ten seconds, he entered the land of dreams as various fragmented scenes appeared alternately before him.\n...\nIn the clearing surrounded by the abandoned warehouses, the Machinery Hivemind came and went before coming again. The person in charge of investigating this incident went from being a team captain to an expert at the rank of deacon.\nIkanser Bernard's brown hair remained unkempt and stuck out stubbornly, making it impossible to hide them even with a hat on.\nThis led to many members of the Machinery Hivemind to secretly joke that the deacon probably used a bomb to style his hair.\nAt this moment, Ikanser, with his cut jaw and facial features, was holding a silver mirror with ancient patterns on it.\nOn each side of the mirror was an eye-like ornament. They were built on the foundation of a black gem which looked serene and charming.\nIkanser surveyed the area and said, \"Although the rats in the sewers are experts at interfering with divination and mediumship and had already dealt with the scene effectively, this is a mysterious Beyonder world, and there is no way to guarantee a one hundred percent success.\"\nAs he spoke, he looked at the silver mirror in his hand as he used his right hand to touch its surface thrice.\nAfter pausing for two seconds, Ikanser took a deep breath and said in a deep voice, \"Respected Arrodes, my question is \u2018Who were the participants in the incident that just happened here?'\"\nThe surrounding darkness suddenly thickened, and the surface of the silver mirror began to ripple with aqueous light.\nSoon, a scene appeared in the silver mirror.\nAmidst the rising flames, there was a figure floating in the air. He was wearing a black double-breasted frock coat and a half top hat. His body was distorted, and his face was indistinct. Furthermore, his face was smeared with paint.\nBeneath his feet, flames rose up and engulfed him.\nAs the aqueous light flashed, the scene changed. A middle-aged man in a dark red cloak appeared. His arm was burning with resplendent flames, but his head was hidden in the darkness.\nScene after scene was played out in front of their eyes. They saw a woman with a complicated black regal dress and messy blonde hair. However, her face was completely transparent, as if she didn't exist.\nBeside this lady were two men with black fur all over their bodies. Only their backs could be seen as they were being pulled by strange arms.\nFinally, the changes came to an end as it fixed onto the blazing flames that soared into the sky. The \"fireworks\" bloomed in a splendid and resplendent fashion as they lit up the entire scene.\nIn this dreamlike scene, the man in the black double-breasted frock coat appeared once again.\nTwisting and retracting, he faced forward, pressed his hat to his chest, and bowed slightly.\nNot only was his face extremely blurry after being interfered with, but it also presented a glisten of oil.\nJust as Ikanser was about to ask his teammates for their opinions, several lines of text in ancient Feysac appeared on the surface of the mirror.\n\"Based on the principle of reciprocity, it's my turn to ask the question.\n\"If you answer wrong or lie, you will be punished.\"\nThe word \"punishment\" was blood-red, as if it were dripping with liquid!\nThe expression on Ikanser's face was twisted at first before it turned abnormally serious.\nSoon after, the mirror's aqueous light flashed and a new line of text appeared.\n\"What's your sexual orientation?\"\nIkanser was stunned as he felt the gazes of his surrounding team members all land on him.\n...\nSix in the morning. The sky was just beginning to brighten.\nThe sleeping Klein awoke to the punctual church bells.\nAccording to his usual habits, he would just turn around and continue sleeping until it was almost 8 o'clock. But this time, he immediately sat up and looked around.\n\"Yeah, I didn't get raided on the pretext of checking my gas meter...\" He let out a sigh of relief, and without even bothering to clean himself, he got off the bed and took four steps counterclockwise to go above the gray fog.\nHe wanted to study his spoils from last night!\nSitting in The Fool's seat, Klein started from the simplest.\nHe picked up the dark-green fang and observed it for a few seconds. Then, he conjured a pen and paper and wrote the divination sentence: \"Its effects.\"\nThis didn't mean that divination could be used as a substitute for experimentation. With the fact that he held the item in his possession, and how he knew a lot about Prisoner, Lunatic, and Werewolf from Sharron and Maric, he believed that it was enough for him to attempt to gain some revelations from it.\nAfter reciting the statement, he quickly entered the dreamland and witnessed one scene after another.\nA vicious wound appeared on Werewolf Tyre's stomach, and his intestines flowed out as they were dragged across the ground. However, he only washed it with water and stuffed the intestines back into his stomach. He pinched both sides of the wound, and in the end, the wound actually healed...\nUnder the perfect red moon, he faced the sky and let out a long howl. Black fur grew out of his body, inch by inch, and the fangs in his mouth were distinct...\nHe waved his claws and cracked the steel plate that wasn't considered thin...\nHe ran wildly through the wilderness, increasing the gap between him and the group of pursuing gray wolves as he ran further and further away...\nHe made the attendants, whose eyes were glazed but cold, charge at their enemies without fear of death...\nHe also used a variety of weapons to kill people, including bombs, and he became stronger as he lost his reasoning while in his enraged state...\n...\nOpening his eyes, Klein roughly understood the characteristics of a Werewolf and grasped the hidden dangers of this Beyonder characteristic.\nWerewolf Tyre had been under the full moon's illumination, allowing him to be unrestrained towards his desires. After his death, he left a relatively strong spiritual mark, so those Beyonders, who would use this Beyonder characteristic to concoct a potion to advance themselves to the next Sequence, had to resist this kind of effect at an early stage; otherwise, they would show signs of losing control.\nHowever, the negative effects had yet to reach the level of a Sealed Artifact, and the Beyonder characteristic left behind by the Werewolf could still be used as the main ingredient for a potion.\nThat's good... Unfortunately, Zombie Jack's Beyonder characteristic has been swallowed by that strange door... I wonder where it leads to and if there's a way to get it back...Klein put down the dark-green fang, feeling both regret and sadness for his loss, before picking up the bottom of brown translucent biological poison.\nHe repeated the same procedure and performed a dream divination, but this time he didn't have the confidence to gain a detailed revelation. Therefore, he changed the divination statement to: \"Its positive and negative effects.\"\nIn the gray gloom of the dream world, Klein once again saw tragic scenes.\nSomeone fell to the ground, scratching himself and ripping off his skin, flesh, and even bones...\nAnother person held his head, his eyes losing focus while his auras weakened...\nOne kept vomiting. Towards the end, the person who died was convulsing...\nSomeone burst out laughing, laughing so hard that he couldn't even breathe...\nSome people stopped fighting and looked at each other. Then, they hugged and kissed each other...\nWhen the scene reached the end, the translucent brown bottle was placed into a cup with water. The transparent liquid inside gradually turned amber in color and was drunk... The person holding onto the bottle of biological poison was weakened at first before coughing. Then, he touched his forehead. He found himself scalding as his condition turned for the worse...\nThe dream quickly ended. Klein tapped his finger on the edge of the long table as he attempted to interpret the revelation with great difficulty.\nAccording to Steve, the earlier revelations mean that after the biological poison's bottle lid is removed, it would keep emanating its poison. As for which poison the opponents gets inflicted by, it's completely random, and even the wielder is unable to control it? The poison inside is really quite abominable...\nThe effective range of the poison cannot be deciphered via a revelation... Hmm, soaking it in water and drinking the amber liquid in advance would prevent one from getting poisoned? But how many minutes should the soaking take? Even if the person holding the Biological Poison Bottle doesn't open the lid, their bodies would get worse as they slowly get infected, and the ailments become serious? Uh, what's the exact cut-off time?\nKlein rubbed his forehead, intending to do some experiments above the gray fog when he was free, but he didn't know if the Biological Poison Bottle was effective in there.\nFor example, in his current Spirit Body state, he wasn't afraid of being poisoned at all.\nI'll leave it at this. I'll study it in detail in the future...Klein turned his attention to the Book of Secrets, which was bound in goatskin. He then casually flipped to the first page.\nIt was a title page with simple patterns on it but with nothing written on it...\nFlipping another page, Klein finally saw the opening line of the Book of Secrets: \"We worship the moon, not the Evernight Goddess.\""}
{"num_chp":792,"summary":"The Hermit similarly thought of The World Gehrman Sparrow from hearing the Beyonder powers which were recorded in Leymano's Travels.\nI wonder if I can pay a certain price to get The Fool to showcase demigod powers of the Storm pathway as well as \"His\" domain... This will be better than seeking the help of the Moses Ascetic Order. That will make them know of my possession of Leymano's Travels... Hmm, I should first write to Her Majesty. Perhaps, she will come to the Future to showcase her powers...Cattleya was increasingly convinced that the spellbook had a value that exceeded its level and was very regretful that Miss Magician was only renting it.\nAfter hearing the description, Emlyn heaved a sigh of relief. This was because the Beyonder powers like Lightning were very lethal against artificial vampires.\nOf course, it was the same for Sanguine.\nVery good. I was still worried about needing to seek The Sun's help and passing Leymano's Travels to him to get him to showcase purification powers to be recorded...Emlyn instantly became relaxed as he glanced at Derrick beside him while saying to Fors, \"Deal.\"\n400 pounds with the recording of a few Beyonder powers was nothing compared to the completion of his mission.\nI can earn money quickly and also obtain Beyonder powers this way...Fors suddenly felt that her future was bright as she hurriedly smiled.\n\"Alright, I'll get Mr. Fool to transfer it to you after the gathering.\"\nRight on the heels of that, she turned to say to Cattleya, \"Ma'am, the Abraham family's direct descendant has given a reply. Do you wish to communicate privately or have me directly say it out loud?\"\nCattleya thought and said, \"Let's do it privately.\"\nSoon, the others had their senses blocked as Fors recounted what her teacher said:\n\"They don't know much about Mr. Door either. They only know two things, no-three.\"\n\"First, among their ancestors, there is an existence known as Mr. Door.\n\"Second, this ancestor vanished in the War of the Four Emperors. They've been struggling to find him.\n\"Third, they will hear ravings that can cause a loss of control during the full moon and Blood Moon.\n\"In addition, they temporarily do not wish to make any direct contact.\"\nThe third point was added by Fors by herself. She wished that Ma'am Hermit and the Queen Mystic behind her could use this to further understand Mr. Door's matters. This was beneficial in helping the Abraham escape the fate of being cursed.\nMr. Door is the Abraham family's ancestor and \"He\" vanished in the War of the Four Emperors. \"He\" would create ravings during full moons? Hmm, the latter was confirmed by Mr. Fool, so there's nothing suspicious... That is to say that although Mr. Door has vanished, \"He\" still can affect Beyonders of the same bloodline, as well as living beings that used certain items during the full moon and Blood Moon. This means that \"He\" hasn't completely lost his connection with the real world... This is how the emperor was able to interact with \"Him\"? Her Majesty once said that there were members of the Abraham family who worked for the emperor back then...Cattleya had some theories as she gently nodded.\n\"If there are any questions, I'll get you to pass them on.\n\"I'll pay the remaining 650 pounds today.\"\nWith 650 pounds, along with Mr. Moon's 400 pounds, I've made a profit of 1,050 pounds today. Together with the 730 pounds from before, as well as the sale of the two properties to pay Mr. World, I might still have a thousand left. My savings are about to exceed 3,000 pounds! This way, I'll have the money needed to purchase the other main ingredient for Scribe. I might still have some leftover...At that moment, Fors suddenly found herself a little wealthy.\nThis made her consider helping purchase the Interrogator Beyonder characteristic for Xio to make up for the risk she had to endure over Mr. X's assassination.\nAfter the blocking of senses was lifted, Fors heard The World Gehrman Sparrow speak before she could say a word.\n\"I need a mystical item from the Marauder pathway. It can be at Sequence 9 or 8.\"\nCattleya considered for a moment and said, \"I can ask around for you. However, items of the Marauder pathway aren't common. There might be a premium involved.\"\n\"No problem.\" Klein controlled The World to provide the response.\nHe then made his marionette look at the now wealthy Miss Magician.\n\"I want to sell an Interrogator Beyonder characteristic for only 1,000 pounds.\"\nTypically, this Sequence 7 Beyonder characteristic which could be used as a main ingredient should've been priced around 1,200 pounds, but Klein had two sets at the moment. Furthermore, considering how he had used Miss Xio's identity to participate in Mr. X's gathering, there was a certain degree of danger he was bringing to her; therefore, he gave a slight discount.\nIt's only 1,000 pounds. That's like a sale at a department store! But why does Mr. World know that I want it? He is Mr. Fool's Blessed. The Interrogator Beyonder characteristic was in his hands, and he is also aware that I can now afford it...Fors was stunned for two seconds as she nearly forgot to reply.\nDuring this process, Audrey held back the urge to engage in shopping, because she knew that Xio needed the item.\n1,000 pounds? An Interrogator's Beyonder characteristic?Cattleya seriously thought over the hidden intent behind The World when she heard Miss Magician say, \"Deal!\"\n...I haven't even made my offer...Cattleya mumbled inwardly as she maintained her silence.\nShe could tell that The World and The Magician had reached a strange level of understanding on this matter, so she didn't interject.\nSimilarly, she also sensed that something good had happened to The Hanged Man this week. He appeared more spirited than before, appearing more confident.\nHe previously purchased the potion formula and main ingredients to Ocean Songster... He had also asked me where Obninsks that do not belong to the Church of Storms can be found... This is likely related to the ritual... He has already advanced?Cattleya suddenly felt a sense of danger.\nAs the Admiral of Stars who was famous throughout the Five Seas, she always felt a sense of superiority in the Tarot Club. But in recent times, with The World Gehrman Sparrow showing his ability at hunting pirate admirals, followed by The Hanged Man reaching Sequence 5, a Sequence 5 that made him adept at sea battles, she felt that she no longer had the right to belittle others. She felt a sense of urgency that hadn't existed in her for a long time.\nHowever, I have Sequence 4 ahead of me. It's the boundary between spirituality and godhood. It's not that easy to advance... I still don't see any hope despite preparing for years...Cattleya sighed inwardly as she looked at The World Gehrman Sparrow and asked, \"Any chances for the blood of a Mythical Creature?\"\nI've been waiting for you to ask this!The Fool Klein smiled while watching the transactions as he controlled The World to hoarsely laugh.\n\"That angel got me to ask you what you can give \u2018Him' in exchange for a drop of blood.\n\"\u2018He' emphasizes that it needs to satisfy him.\"\nAngel? Mr. World directly contacted an angel? Furthermore, he has convinced the angel to provide a drop of blood!?Audrey was first alarmed before her thoughts raced as she turned to look at the seat of honor.\nShe suspected that The World, Mr. Fool's Blessed, had contacted an angel that was in service to Mr. Fool!\nShe was like The Magician, believing that The World only knew of clues to the location of an angel or its remains. They never expected him to directly converse with an angel!\nOne had to know that the Grounded Angels were equivalent to the leaders of the seven Churches!\nIndeed...Alger sighed silently, believing that his guess has been verified.\nAs expected of Mr. Fool's Blessed...Cattleya held back her surprise and shock as she pondered.\n\"May I know what pathway this angel is from?\"\nThe World surveyed the area and said, \"Monster.\"\nMonster, which means it's an angel from the Fate pathway? It's no wonder Mr. Fool's honorific name has the words King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck...Audrey, Derrick, and company were enlightened, believing that their inferences matched the actual situation and the inherent logic.\nTheir gazes and guesses stirred Klein. He realized a corresponding problem. In the honorific name he fabricated, the description of wielding good luck had successfully been directed towards the mysterious space above the gray fog!\nIs this related to why the people from the Fate pathway can see my uniqueness? Could this be related to why the Snake of Mercury, Will Auceptin, took the initiative to establish friendly ties with me? In my honorific name's three lines, the first line is a description of my inherent self, and the second is about the corresponding divine domain. Only the third line involves the authority. Wields good luck... Of course, The Fool itself can also contain a certain amount of authority...Klein suddenly felt that he needed to find an opportunity to communicate with the unborn fetus.\nHowever, he suspected that the paper crane would tear at any moment. This was because just erasing the original content was already a rather precarious process.\nAt this moment, Cattleya said, \"Thanks for your help. I will seriously consider it and give you a response as soon as possible.\"\nShe planned on consulting Queen Mystic to see if there were any conditions that would entice an angel from the Fate pathway.\nWith the conversation between The World and The Hermit ending, the transactions came to a formal end. The Tarot Gathering then proceeded into a period for free communication.\nFors thought for a moment and looked at Emlyn.\n\"I'd like to remind you of two things. First, be familiar with the powers on each corresponding page. It will be very dangerous if you were to flip to the wrong page and use the wrong power in combat.\"\nEmlyn scoffed immediately as he said, \"I'm very confident in my intelligence.\"\nFors didn't speak further and switched to mentioning:\n\"A serious case involving Beyonders happened in East Borough. The surrounding region is on high alert. If you plan on carrying out any operations, take note of that.\"\nEmlyn viewed this piece of information with great importance as he asked, \"Are you aware of what happened?\""}
{"num_chp":660,"summary":"One syllable after another of distorted, incomprehensible, jarring, and indecipherable words slowly spewed out of Klein's mouth. It made the hurricane produced by the bronze door's terrifying suction force to instantly calm down, cloaking the already dim surroundings with a deeper gloom.\nOnly at this moment did he know that the Beyonder power which Admiral Hell Ludwell had just used was known as the Language of the Dead. It could circumvent the protection of one's flesh and blood, so as to target the Spirit Body.\nIt belonged to an advancement in a Spirit Medium's powers. It could go from direct communication with spirits to that of commandeering, to the point of enslavement!\nLiving creatures were unable to understand the resounding language. Ludwell couldn't help but freeze on the spot. A transparent layer rapidly surfaced on his pirate captain attire.\nHis spirit was being tugged at by an illusory power!\nAt this moment, the black, square-shaped ring on Ludwell's left index finger produced a faint glow.\nThe minute portion of his Spirit Body which had been forcefully drawn out had returned to his body as the two fused back into one.\nDing!\nWith his right hand, Ludwell drew the thin rapier hanging by his waist.\nIt was iron-black in color, and its tip gathered the surrounding light, turning into a dark point.\nAdmiral Hell suddenly took a step forward and with vigorous wind currents, he suddenly closed the distance between him and Klein. Immediately, he thrust out the rapier in his hand at lightning speed!\nThe bronze door which was covered with mysterious patterns remained standing erected in its original spot. It didn't vanish because of Ludwell's retracting of his left hand and subsequent actions. This was different from the similar-looking ability that Miss Sharron had previously cast using a mystical item.\nOof!\nThe black rapier pierced through Klein in an unavoidable manner.\nKlein's figure rapidly crumpled into a piece of paper. Its surface turned yellow and dry, as though it had been weathered for thousands of years.\nThe hurricane brought about by the bronze door completely pulverized the paper figurine.\nIn midair, Klein jumped out of the darkness as he held a huge handful of charms from the Sea God domain.\n\"Storm!\"\nHe quickly shouted in ancient Hermes as the tin flakes lit up individually as they sacrificed themselves to Sea God. This also meant that if Klein wished so, he could recycle most of the materials and use it multiple times until the metals could no longer withstand the spirituality.\nWhoosh!\nBlue wind blades shot out as the surrounding waters sprayed out heavy waves that were as tall as the ship. As Klein didn't attempt or have the time to distinguish between the different kinds of charms, while these attacks inundated Ludwell, the extraordinary effects also augmented Admiral Hell. He was given augmented effects like Underwater Breathing, underwater mobility, flight, and pressure resistance, none of which were useful at that moment.\nLudwell suddenly opened his mouth and produced a silent screech. He then struck the waves beside him as countless wind blades temporarily froze in midair.\nImmediately following that, Admiral Hell raised his left hand as the black, square-shaped ring on his index finger produced a sinister and eerie glow that instantly brightened.\nWhoosh!\nThe bronze door, which exuded an indescribable feeling, instantly swelled as it doubled in height and width.\nAmidst a heavy creaking sound, the gap in the door opened up. The already terrifying suction force immediately rose to an unimaginable level.\nBlue wind blades and black sea waves were produced as Klein charged at the door from the air, heading straight for the strange vines and arms that extended outwards.\nKlein had planned on using the Priest of Light by clashing head-on with the bronze door with Light of Holiness to catch a breather, but he ended up seeing a glaring white fireball about half the height of a person fly over.\nThe fireball's speed was augmented by the ridiculous suction forces generated by the door. It flew by Klein and smashed at the gap of the mysterious door.\nBoom!\nThe white flames scattered as they rained down, but all it did was make the bronze door quake a little and dim a little.\nKlein took the opportunity and snapped his fingers.\nThe few matchsticks he separated in his pockets immediately lit up as scarlet flames rapidly enveloped his body as he melted away.\nA flame burst out by the side of the bronze door as Klein leaped out of it.\nHe instantly noticed that Anderson Hood was floating in midair in a rather awkward manner. He held a burning-white spear in his palm.\nThe Strongest Hunter had finally arrived, but he just appeared unaccustomed to flying.\nWhen Ludwell looked up and saw this scene, the pale-white flames behind the silver mask clearly jumped twice.\nClearly, he never expected that the Future had two other powerhouses at the pirate admiral level apart from Admiral of Stars Cattleya. Furthermore, they wielded pretty good mystical items and Sealed Artifacts.\nAt this moment, Ludwell suddenly raised his hand and pressed down on his face, surprisingly taking off his silver mask.\nHeavy, pale-white light suddenly spewed out from behind the mask, causing endless silence to instantly spread out from the black, square-shaped ring on Ludwell's left index finger.\nThe silence surged into the bronze door and lifted it off the deck and into the air.\nThe door covered in mysterious patterns fused with the endless silence as it rapidly burgeoned to more than thirty meters tall.\nWith the sea as its base, it stood there, erect like an entrance to another world, one completely different from the present world.\nCreak!\nThe bronze door opened as unspeakable darkness surged out and enveloped the Black Tulip's bow.\nUpon seeing this, Klein didn't focus on his attacks as he quickly took out the correct charm and rapidly used it on himself.\nA strong gust of wind swept over and lifted him above the Black Tulip.\nWith the pull of the darkness, the gigantic sailboat steered into the bronze door, ten meters a time, as it sailed into another world.\nAdmiral Hell Ludwell stood at the bow as he looked up into the sky. His face was blanketed by the pale-white luster, preventing anyone from discerning his looks.\nHis gaze first swept past Klein before landing on Anderson Hood. He seemed to make a mental note of these two hunters, but he didn't make any further attempts to attack. He seemed to have been restrained by the surrounding darkness.\nAnderson was taken aback as he didn't hesitate to throw out the burning-white spear in his hand.\nThe spear shot straight at Ludwell, but once it entered the region enclosed by darkness and silence, it silently vanished.\nLudwell is planning to escape? How decisive...Klein was first stunned before he recalled that Azik's copper whistle was still on the Black Tulip.\nWith the gigantic sailboat halfway inside the bronze door and about to enter another world with no way to stop them, Klein threw a matchstick and snapped his fingers.\nHe appeared fifty meters above the stern where the undead creatures were fighting for Azik's copper whistle. This item which kept changing hands finally burst into a scarlet flame due to the matchsticks tied to it.\nAmidst the flames, Klein's figure surfaced there and grabbed Azik's copper whistle.\nThis was the preparations that he had made for retrieving the copper whistle!\nFurthermore, to prevent any mishaps from happening, such as the matchsticks being pulled away by the undead creatures, he had also coated the copper whistle with an easily flammable essential oil of the sun!\nPa!\nSurrounded by countless undead, Klein didn't have the luxury of time to retract his hand that grabbed the copper whistle. He immediately snapped his fingers again.\nAt this moment, transparent, rotting, pale, or illusory hands grabbed him!\nThe matchstick Klein had previously thrown into the air ignited in midair as it produced a flame.\nHis figure quickly materialized amidst the flames. His face was livid and his lips were white.\nHaving been grabbed by countless shadows, wraiths, and undead creatures, Klein felt that the depths of his Spirit Body was ice-cold. He couldn't control his body as he plummeted into the sea dyed in gold.\nWith the Black Tulip almost completely crossing the bronze door, the sea which appeared like an entrance to hell had been restored to normal.\nKlein sank a few meters and swallowed a few mouthfuls of bitter and astringent seawater before he ultimately recovered.\nThankfully I was sufficiently prepared...As this thought flashed past his mind, he suddenly felt something amiss.\nBy wearing the Murloc Cufflink, he had the passive ability to breathe underwater for ten minutes. He shouldn't have drank mouthfuls of water!\nKlein suddenly turned his head and looked at his wrist, only to realize that the blue cufflink had detached itself at some point in time.\nIt's lost... Tinder lost it... I was on the Black Tulip the entire time...Klein splashed a few times and floated to the surface, just in time to see the gigantic sailboat's tail meld into the darkness as the bronze door slowly closed.\nHe instinctively swam forward a few seconds before ultimately stopping. He selected one of his remaining charms and gave himself the Beyonder effect of Underwater Breathing.\nIn midair, Anderson Hood clicked his tongue when he saw this.\n\"This fellow is really crazy...\n\"He's actually trying to engage in pursuit!\"\nAt this moment, the starlight above the Future fell and condensed into a long bridge that extended over.\nCattleya had finally finished off the grayish-black monster with immense vitality!\nWhat a pity. If only Admiral Hell had hesitated a little and didn't flee in such a timely fashion...Anderson Hood sighed silently and firmly landed on the star bridge.\nAs he watched Gehrman Sparrow fly over, he was just about to greet and praise him when he saw the cold and gloomy expression.\nAnderson instinctively made way and chuckled dryly, allowing Gehrman Sparrow to walk past him.\nAfter returning to the Future via the star bridge, Klein held back his effusing emotions and watched Frank Lee walk over and give him a thumbs up.\n\"You're the craziest fellow I've ever met!\n\"You actually dared to board the Black Tulip alone and single-handedly challenge Admiral Hell. You even returned alive!\"\nSorry, in terms of craziness, I'm far inferior to you...Klein thought in response.\nAt this moment, pirates with long or disheveled hair expressed their astonishment and amazement.\nIn such an atmosphere, Klein closed his eyes and felt his Faceless potion completely digest."}
{"num_chp":1111,"summary":"Upon hearing the Red Angel evil spirit's reply, Demoness of White Katarina's expression instantly froze, unable to contain her anger.\nSauron Einhorn Medici laughed and continued, \"You must've become a demigod at the end of the Fourth Epoch. It's been more than a thousand years, but you haven't become an angel. Don't you feel inferior?\n\"As for that fellow just now, he had to rely on Azik Eggers to face you head-on in the beginning. He was as weak as a chick that had just hatched. But now, in less than a year, he has already advanced to Sequence 4 and obtained godhood. He has the ability to match your strength. Don't you have any thoughts about this? Didn't you think that the past thousand years were a waste? Even a dog might open the gates to angelhood after living for more than a thousand years.\n\"I know what you're thinking. You're very jealous, and on the other hand, you also have a twisted desire. You want to prove yourself by sleeping with him. You Demonesses are really laughable. On the one hand, you insist that you were originally men so as to prevent yourself from losing yourself, thus, resulting in you losing control. On the other hand, you have to showcase the charm of a woman and try your hand at extreme pleasure and intense love. But we Hunters have no such problem. Regardless of what gender we were in the beginning, all we need to do in the future is war, war, war!\n\"Primordial really is a twisted fellow. Letting a pure woman take the path of a Demoness would be so much better; however, generation after generation, you pass the damage down. And for what? Isn't the main goal merely to seek revenge on fate?\"\nEvery word of the Red Angel evil spirit was like an arrow that stabbed into the heart of the Demoness of White. It made her beautiful and exquisite face twitch, and her smooth, raven-black, long hair seemed to grow thicker.\nSauron Einhorn Medici glanced at Katarina and immediately chortled.\n\"Don't tell me that you're losing control because of my provocation?\n\"What a nostalgic feeling.\"\nThe Red Angel evil spirit paused for a moment before saying:\nYou can leave now. If there's anything, then remember to recite my honorific name. Of course, I will come to you directly if I have to.\"\nDemoness of White Katarina's expression returned to normal. She frowned slightly and asked in disbelief, \"You're letting me leave, just like that?\"\nThe Red Angel evil spirit chuckled.\n\"Why? Do you want to sleep with me? It's not impossible if the timing is right, but there's something very important that needs to be done right now.\n\"Don't worry. Since you've already recited my honorific name and given me a drop of your blood, you'll be under my watch, and you can be affected by me at any moment.\n\"Have you already forgotten the differences between an angel and a saint? Don't you know how powerful a real high- level figure is?\n\"Heh heh, unless you directly pray to Primordial and receive a response; otherwise, you'll never be able to free yourself from my gaze. Well, in normal circumstances, an angel can do such a thing, but that's only limited to the situation of you only chanting my honorific name. If you don't believe me, I'll let you seek the help of an angel.\"\nDemoness of White Katarina listened with a gloomy expression before finally smiling.\n\"I'll keep your teachings in mind, Lord Medici.\"\nSauron Einhorn Medici's eyebrows twitched.\n\"You don't seem so compliant. I can even imagine how you were when you faced Gehrman Sparrow, but I don't care.\n\"Ah, I forgot to tell you. It's best if you immediately confirm the condition of your bloodline descendants. Don't you find it suspicious that Gehrman Sparrow managed to find you so easily?\"\nKatarina's face turned slightly pale, but then it grew serious. She slowly nodded and said, \"I understand.\"\nWith that said, she immediately retreated and entered the glass window again. It was unknown where she was headed for in the illusory, stacked mirror world.\nWith the Demoness of White disappearing, a bloody gash suddenly appeared on the left side of the Red Angel evil spirit's left cheek and made a sound:\n\"What an excellent actress. She made it seem like she wasn't good at controlling her expression, showing her restlessness and lack of intelligence as though it was easy for her ulterior motives to be discovered.\"\n\"That's right. That way, there's a high chance that we would belittle her and let our guard down against her.\" The Red Angel evil spirit's right cheek also cracked open in a hideous manner.\n\"Tsk, Demonesses are indeed very cunning. However, I've never underestimated any prey.\" The Red Angel evil spirit used \"His\" normal mouth to say, \"She wants to desensitize me and make me belittle her, but it's impossible.\"\nThe bloody gash on \"His\" left cheek opened and closed and replied, \"Then why were you captured by Alista Tudor?\"\n\"That's because of the two of you.\" The personality that belonged to Medici pouted and said, \"It had nothing to do with belittlement and desensitization.\"\nThe blood-colored crack on his right snorted and said, \"How does it feel like to become someone else's prey? The mighty God of War, the Red Angel beside the Creator?\"\n\"Not bad.\" Medici's expression darkened a little, but \"His\" words seemed to contain some self-complacency.\nThe personality that belonged to Sauron said with the left cheek, \"You really like to bluff in order to achieve your goals. Back then, Alista and company managed to see through your lies, which was why they managed to seize the opportunity.\n\"And just now, you were bluffing Katarina. You're only capable of releasing your aura, relying on traps and surprise attacks to bring about a certain amount of damage. There was no way you could quickly finish her off, but you pretended that you had returned to your Sequence 1 state, tricking her into reciting your honorific name and handing over her blood.\"\nMedici pouted again and said, \"A bluff is also a normal playstyle in poker. The effect is pretty good, isn't it?\"\nAt this point, the Red Angel chuckled and said, \"Furthermore, it's not just a bluff. What I'm most fond of is to mix in a truth or two every few bluffs, allowing me to wait for fellows who think they've seen through my disguise to step into a trap. It's just like the mistakes you two idiots made back then.\"\n\"But you were the first to die!\" The two sides of the Red Angel evil spirit's face cracked at the same time.\nWithout any hesitation, Medici said, \"That means I'm the strongest, worthy of having the most attention!\"\nWith that said, the three personalities of the Red Angel evil spirit fell silent at the same time. After a few seconds, the blood-colored crack that represented Einhorn opened and closed.\n\"Gehrman Sparrow's connection with Evernight is tighter than I imagined. He should've noticed Katarina's true state just now.\"\nMedici chuckled and said, \"It's alright. This is something \u2018She' has tacitly allowed in the first place.\n\"Back when the Great Smog of Backlund happened, the ones who participated in the operation are all gone. Only that Demoness named Trissy is still alive. Isn't that enough to explain something?\"\nSauron and Einhorn didn't speak further as they allowed the bloody crack on the cheeks to wriggle and heal.\nThe Red Angel evil spirit then reflected \"Himself on the glass window and disappeared from the area around the Bell of Order.\nAbove the grayish-white fog, inside the ancient palace.\nLooking at the spinning topaz pendant in his hand, Klein nodded indiscernibly.\nHe had already used spirit dowsing to confirm Katarina's answers, and he came up with a concrete conclusion.\nRight on the heels of that, he began his dream divination based on what he knew of the eight secret mausoleums. He saw the corresponding areas and their blurry states.\nThis made him understand that entry was impossible via normal methods. Even the process of prying without interference had difficulties in locating the interior of the mausoleums.\nThis is very troublesome... Also, when I was channeling the Demoness of White girl's spirit, it was quite different from the time when I did it for Qonas Kilgor and Hvin Rambis. She had too many expressions, and her answer was more proactive... Is this something special about Demonesses, or is it due to other factors? With a thought, he beckoned with his hand to draw out a piece of paper that was stained with Vice Admiral Ailment's blood. He wrote down the corresponding sentence and made a dream divination to search for his target.\nIn the blurry world, Klein saw Tracy, who had escaped from her spider webs, looking out the window.\nThere was a dark and illusory storm around there, making it impossible for him to know where it was.\nTracy has escaped... She doesn't look sad. She only feels a certain amount of anger and confusion... Her relationship with the Demoness of White is so terrible? Or could it be... Just as he was feeling puzzled, he saw a black flame suddenly ignite and melt his dream away.\nHe opened his eyes and confirmed that he could no longer use the blood in his hand to divine the location of Vice Admiral Ailment Tracy. This meant that a demigod powerhouse had used a mysticism technique to sever the connection between the two.\nCould it be that the Demoness of White Katarina isn't dead yet? This... Right, when the Red Angel evil spirit answered me, \"He\" was using rhetorical questions. He didn't admit it at all... I was channeling the spirit of a living person! Klein was instantly enlightened as he hurriedly made another divination. Finally, he confirmed that the Demoness of White really was still alive.\nIndeed, the Red Angel evil spirit's true target isn't the Demoness of White... Also, combined with the feedback from the progress of my potion's digestion, is it right for me to say that the Red Angel evil spirit is weaker than I imagined? \"He\" hasn't even recovered to the level of Sequence 2, and he was unable to quickly finish off the Demoness of White. \"He\" could only rely on other means to subdue her? After pondering for a moment, Klein realized he couldn't come to a conclusion.\nHe quickly reined in his thoughts and stopped considering the problem. This was because he had already obtained the information he needed from Demoness of White Katarina.\nKlein put down the piece of paper that was stained with Vice Admiral Ailment's blood and suddenly chuckled.\nSevering the connection between the blood and the body, preventing powers of divination and prophecy from using it as a medium?\nI wonder if it will work when rubbing it on the surface of Groselle's Travels?\nAfter looking at the piece of paper for a few seconds, Klein temporarily gave up on the idea of testing it, because there was no need for it.\nHis focus quickly shifted to the other eight mausoleums of George III.\nOrdinary lines of thought shouldn't work. The things that I can come up with are definitely things that the angels and saints under George III can figure out as well...\nIf it wasn't for the fact that the gods have already tacitly allowed this matter, exposing this matter by printing it on flyers might've been effective...\nHmm, teleportation nexus... the Tudor Ruins... This...\nAs he thought about it, a thought suddenly came to his mind. He had an idea."}
{"num_chp":929,"summary":"Chapter 929 True Soul Body\n\"Fate!\"\nAs the dragged out and abstruse ancient Hermes term resounded, the spots where the Spirit World Plunderer and Klein stood suddenly darkened.\nIt wasn't very obvious, as though a cloud had drifted over in midair without stopping.\nBut when this illusionary shadow dissipated, the invisible figure that was donning a translucent white robe stood frozen on the spot. The surface of its clothes showed signs of worms crawling across it. It was sluggish, slow, and in a dire state.\nAcross it, Klein's eyes had their lucidity return. The meat tendrils on the shadowed face beneath the papal tiara vanished.\nIt appeared as though it wasn't the Spirit World Plunderer who had controlled Klein's Spirit Body Threads and nearly succeeded; instead, it appeared as though Klein was the one who was controlling it and had nearly converted it into his marionette!\nThe Fate Siphon charm switched one's fate!\nThis was a high-level charm made using a Worm of Time. It could siphon off the target's subsequent fate, and in a short period of time, burden it with that of the target's, so as to complete an exchanging of fates.\nTherefore Klein and the Spirit World Plunderer's situations had switched. One went from death to survival, while the other went from victory to instant despair.\nAfter confirming that the Spirit World Plunderer was intelligent and extremely difficult to deal with, making it difficult to hunt it, Klein began putting on an act of retreating. He appeared rash as he deliberately walked into the Spirit World Plunderer's control, enticing its actions, ready to use the Fate Siphon charm at the critical moment!\nThat way, what terrible acts the Spirit World Plunderer did to its enemy, the charm would then allow it to experience the same despair!\nOf course, if the Fate Siphon charm didn't have the expected effect, or if the Spirit World Plunderer's main soul didn't appear and had ended up using other means to control the situation, Klein still had his last trick up his sleeve to protect himselfdirectly end the summoning and return above the gray fog. He would sacrifice his two marionettes and a few mystical items in order to ensure his own safety.\nWithout the time to marvel at how magical the Fate Siphon charm was, or how terrifying angels from the Marauder pathway were, Klein didn't hesitate to raise the Sea God Scepter high up before the swapping of fates ended.\nThe dark blue papal robe flared up with the wind as the golden papal tiara emitted meshed blue and silver beams of light. At the tip of the white bone scepter, it shot out bolts of lightning that gathered into a ball before landing on the Spirit World Plunderer's body!\nA swath of silver color brightened up immediately, inundating the target, turning the surroundings white.\nOnce, twice, thrice. Klein continuously triggered terrifying lightning balls, expending his spirituality without holding back.\nFinally, he heard a roar that seemed to stem from the depths of one's soul as he instinctively sensed that his target had collapsed and dissipated.\nOnly then did Klein lower the Sea God Scepter and watch the silver lightning sizzle away.\nAt that moment, his entire Spirit Body had turned rather illusory. Even with the Tyrant's augmentation, it didn't seem real.\nAs the lightning dispersed, the invisible figure in the white translucent robe appeared once again in Klein's sight.\nFlickering light emerged from within as the Spirit World Plunderer's body cracked, turning into countless illusory bubbles that disintegrated bit by\nbit.\nThe Tyrant had succeeded in the hunt.\nAt this moment, deep within Calder\u00f3n City, there was a sudden quake. It was as though a massive creature had awoken as a result of the Spirit World Plunderer's death, or that countless dangerous creatures were surging out.\nThe indescribable feeling combined into a swath of illusory grayish-white and, like a tidal wave, rose up from the bottom.\nOther Spirit World Plunderers? No, it appears to be a more terrifying and horrible creature. A being that the Spirit World Plunderer attends to? Also, in Calder\u00f3n City's core region, at the end of the deep pit, it's still as silent as ever. There's no sound at all, making it more horrifying... Klein pumped himself up as he diverted some attention in order to monitor the situation inside Calder\u00f3n City as he anxiously waited for the Spirit World Plunderer's characteristic to appear to form an ingredient.\nHe wasn't relishing in the delight of a successful hunt but was pacing about anxiously at the edge of the abyss.\nDuring this process, Klein got Enzo and Ludwell to stay close to him. He threw the Sea God Scepter to the former so as to escape the state of irascibility. He began considering how to deal with the subsequent development with a clear mind, as well as consider whether he had missed out on some other details.\nAs the thoughts flashed in his mind, Klein suddenly recalled something:\nBack when he made the mystical items sing, Creeping Hunger had praised the True Creator and had used \"His\" complete honorific name.\nAlthough the human-skinned glove had used Hermes instead of ancient Hermes or other languages that could stir the powers of nature, the former was still usable when it came to sacrifices! This also meant that the True Creator might've very well heard Creeping Hunger's praises and noticed the commotion here.\nApart from the rising grayish-white tide and the terrifying creature deep down in the city, there are other dangers... Wait, I'm now a Spirit Body, equivalent to a wraith. I'm not in my normal state... Just as Klein's mind thought of something, his spiritual perception was triggered as he instinctively cast his gaze at the entrance to Calder\u00f3n City.\nThe lights there flickered as a figure entered.\nThe figure was wearing a simple and ordinary linen robe with a head of silver hair.\nHe was a handsome man with soft facial features. His eyes were gentle with some hints of coldness. It was as though he was observing the fates of everyone in the world like a spectator.\nBehind him, there were beams forming illusory layers of pure wings. They spread outwards, blocking the entire entrance.\nILI\nKlein nearly hissed through the gaps in his teeth as a series of titles and names flashed across his mind:\nOuroboros!\nTail Devourer!\nAngel of Fate!\nKing of Angels!\nHe didn't have the luxury of time to consider the possibility of his previous thought. His body expanded as though it was incorporeal, enveloping his marionettes, Enzo and Ludwell, the yet-to-appear characteristic, and the Spirit World Plunderer's remnant bubbles within!\nAt this moment, Ouroboros's silver eyes already had the distant figure in \"His\" sights. It was a figure wearing a papal tiara and a dark blue robe, exuding extreme oppression and tyranny. There was a grayish-white fog that had been blurred by the Tyrant's aura.\nA river of flickering light appeared in \"His\" eyes, seeming to circle the Tyrant figure and the periphery of Calder\u00f3n City.\nSilently, the square houses and the pale-white columns stood up again despite being destroyed by the Lightning Storm from before. The charred legs of the giant blacksmith once again possessed a body as he appeared inside the tomb, striking at the anvil.\nAll of this returned to what it was like shortly after the Tyrant stepped in.\nHowever, Klein in his pontiff attire had vanished. His two marionettes along with the remnant bubbles of the Spirit World Plunderer had vanished as well.\nThe corresponding figure was unable to return as the rebooted scene shattered, turning back to the desolate state after the battle.\nTail Devourer Ouroboros watched silently for a long while before making a move. The grayish-white swath that rose up from the depth of Calder\u00f3n City slowly receded back down.\nAbove the gray fog, Klein slumped in the high-back chair of The Fool in exhaustion. He wasn't even able to get Enzo and Ludwell to massage him.\nHe had already thrown the Sea God Scepter back to the junk pile. The Tyrant card had left his soul body and was placed facing down beside the Black Emperor card. The Spirit World Plunderer's bubbles were floating ahead, with the Beyonder characteristic constantly seeping out before combining with the points of light.\nAfter resting for a while, Klein saw grayish-white powder fall onto the mottled table's surface. Following that was a transparent item that seemed weightless.\nThe item was the size of a palm, formed by coiled maggots. It was almost shaped like a human, and its interior was filled with a colorless liquid. Bubbles often emerged, scattering black hints of light.\nKlein didn't dare to look at it carefully, as there was a more complicated structure in the weightless transparent object. They formed indescribable patterns and symbols that seemed to fuse knowledge, power, transformation, secrets, bizarreness, and madness within, making them no longer abstract.\nThis made Klein feel very dizzy. His mind was even on the verge of breaking down, with his soul almost losing control.\nThis is likely the true soul of the Spirit World Plunderer... I have the corresponding powder as well. There's about 70 grams, more than I needed. It's more than I expected. Klein nodded indiscernibly and stored the powder into a box. Together with the true soul body, he threw them on the junk pile and covered it with the gray fog.\nAfter completing this, he raised his hand to rub his temples and made a self-deprecating remark:\nIf it wasn't for the Sea God Scepter, I probably would've had to leave Calder\u00f3n City due to the assault of the Spirit World Plunderer. I would then wait until I had helpers and could make the most solid of hunting plans so as to control the stirrings of the area to not alarm the unknown entity at the core region...\nSigh, I was rash the entire time. Although the outcome was fine, it really doesn't suit my character. It's also completely at odds with the Seer pathway's acting. In the future, I should try to avoid using the Sea God Scepter in the outside world.\nUh... The Spirit World Plunderer has been successfully hunted. There's no need for me to get Miss Sharron's help. In a few days, I'll write to her so that she won't be thinking over this matter.\nHowever, I have a premonition that I'll still be heading to Calder\u00f3n City in the future. When that happens, perhaps I might still need Miss Sharron's help.\nIn addition, I have to seek out information on Bizarro Banes. I can't put all my hope on the City of Silver...\nAmidst his thoughts, Klein directly returned to his body, without bringing his marionettes. He ended the ritual and headed straight for bed, falling asleep the moment his head hit the pillow.\n\"Escaped?\" Soest looked at the man opposite him and asked Daly Simone who was carrying out a spirit channeling\nThey had just finished their operation and had captured a few Numinous Episcopate members. However, the key personnel the intel pointed at, Hand of White Palenque Taciblius, wasn't at the secret gathering point.\nHe was a Sequence 4 demigod; therefore, not only had the Red Gloves team used a Grade 1 Sealed Artifact, they had even requested Goddess's Eye Ilya's help. However, it was all futile.\nDaly Simone nodded.\n\"Yes.\"\nShe then looked at the captive, suddenly speaking with an ethereal voice, \"Where did Palenque Taciblius go?\"\n\"H-he said he was going to meet someone,\" the Numinous Episcopate member answered slowly.\n\"Who is that person?\" Daly Simone pressed. Leonard Mitchell and company also cast their gazes over.\nThe man who was being spirit channeled answered with an unperturbed voice, \"Ince Zangwill.\""}
{"num_chp":776,"summary":"Without the high tea session, Klein decided to pray at Saint Samuel Cathedral, so as to show his devoutness.\nOf course, he didn't forget to stop and admire the white pigeons on the square, allowing himself to appear leisurely and calm.\nHe entered the cathedral, passing through the murals that were illuminated by the sun from high above and arriving at a dark and deep prayer hall.\nThis place wasn't as gorgeously decorated like the other Churches that had all kinds of dazzling elegant taste that produced a visual impact. Instead, it was mild and peaceful, allowing one to feel a natural sense of tranquility. As for the pure light that resembled twinkling stars up ahead, they were filled with the intense solemnity of holiness.\nKlein removed his hat and handed it to Richardson along with his cane. Then, he walked down the aisle.\nAt this moment, two figures stood up in the front pew and turned towards the entrance. One of them was the black-haired, green-eyed Leonard Mitchell who looked suave with his untidy hair.\nAlmost at the same moment, Leonard Mitchell also saw the middle-aged man with the white sideburns and deep blue eyes.\nDwayne Dant\u00e8s...He tensed up momentarily as his body showed signs of indiscernible stiffness.\nKlein gave Leonard a side look as he nodded with a smile. He had a friendly and casual expression.\n\"...\"\nLeonard forced a smile as he nodded in a slightly sluggish manner.\nFollowing that, he turned to the side, made way, and brushed shoulders with Dwayne Dant\u00e8s.\nThis made Klein see who the person was behind him. It was also someone he knew-Daly who was wearing a spirit medium's black robe.\nThis lady still wore blue eyeshadow and blush, presenting quite an uncanny sense of beauty.\nDaly glanced at the middle-aged gentleman when her expression suddenly went adrift. She retracted her gaze as she silently approached the exit.\nNo way, I was just mimicking Captain's profound eyes. Even the color is different, yet Ma'am Daly could still find it familiar? A woman's intuition is truly terrifying...Klein had a vague guess when he noticed Daly's brief abnormality.\nA long time ago, as an insensitive man, he believed that Ma'am Daly was secretly in love with Captain; otherwise, she wouldn't have endured the risk to rush to Tingen to get Klein to find an opportunity to teach the acting method to Dunn Smith.\nAs for Captain, Klein wasn't sure about his thoughts. After all, Dunn Smith, at that moment, was often unable to distinguish reality from a dream. His bad memory was rather pronounced, and he might unknowingly have forgotten certain things that lay at the bottom of his heart.\nHowever, Captain often mentions Ma'am Daly, using her as an example to educate us. He was so familiar with how many years she took to advance and the kind of talent she had that it seemed like he had memorized it... Yes, whenever Captain mentioned these matters, he would occasionally add that he spent nine years going from Midnight Poet to Nightmare... C-could it be that he was feeling a little inferior when facing Ma'am Daly? Inferior...Klein recalled the past as his mood suddenly felt dampened.\nHe realized that he didn't really understand Dunn Smith. He didn't understand how many things the man had hidden inwardly.\nAnd Ma'am Daly isn't much younger than him. She appears to be very open and doesn't care about marriage...Klein silently sighed and reined in his thoughts. He found a nearby pew and bowed his head, closing his eyes to pray.\nOutside the prayer hall, Leonard had recovered as he gathered with the other Red Gloves teammates with Daly.\nThey waited for a while as Soest, who had become a Spirit Warlock, walked out from another side. He scanned them and said, \"Our mission this time is to use the various clues discovered from the explosion of the Black Skeleton Gang's headquarters to find all the formal members of the Numinous Episcopate in Backlund.\n\"Ma'am Daly is a Beyonder from the Corpse Collector pathway. She knows quite a bit about the Numinous Episcopate, so His Grace, Saint Anthony, has gotten her to assist us.\"\n...\nIn the evening, Klein, who had dismissed Richardson, took four steps counterclockwise and entered above the gray fog. He conjured The World Gehrman Sparrow and made his blurry figure pray.\n\"...Please inform Miss Magician that she needs to reserve a hotel room before Friday night. It's best that it's far from the place where Mr. X holds the gathering...\n\"...Pass me the stone and spellbook ahead of time. I need to make certain preparations...\n\"...On Friday night, she needs to stop her friend who participates in Mr. X's gathering and also present to me that person's external appearance when in disguise...\n\"...If there's anything else, I'll inform her in time.\"\nWith only two days left before the assassination attempt on Mr. X, Klein undoubtedly needed to prepare ahead of time. And there were many things that needed preparation. Dwayne Dant\u00e8s wasn't able to do everything, so he had to rely on Miss Magician.\nHis preliminary plan was to use the powers of a Faceless to disguise himself as a participant in Mr. X's gathering. He would enter directly with the passcode, and then he would employ different plans based on the situation.\nAccording to the experience he had in engaging in combat and controlling his marionette, Klein had a feeling that a Marionettist's principle was \"try to hide behind the scenes, covertly directing a script.\"\nUnless necessary, a Marionettist had to avoid engaging in direct combat with others!\nCurrently, the most troublesome point is that Mr. X's gathering is at eight. And usually, at this time, Dwayne Dant\u00e8s clearly wouldn't have fallen asleep. He won't be able to escape the notice of his butler and servants and secretly head to East Borough... Of course, on the contrary, it can also create an alibi, but the problem is, what method should I use to fool everyone in his house... If only I had a Faceless partner who can act as Dwayne Dant\u00e8s... Miss Justice's necklace can do it, but she's not in Backlund...Klein leaned back into his chair as he rubbed his temples.\nHe had even considered directly summoning and responding to himself, using his identity as Hero Bandit Black Emperor to carry out the operation, but doing so would cause him to lose the ability to change his physical appearance. It also made it difficult for him to possess others and disguise as Fors's friend to participate in the gathering.\nUnless Miss Magician's friend is a part of this, allowing me to possess him or her... That wouldn't do either. First, it will expose some of the Tarot Club's secrets, and second, Mr. X might have the means to discover a Wraith. Of course, traces of this can be concealed using a series of seals with a gold coin, the Paper Angel, or the iron cigar case...Klein considered for a while before deciding on a method he was very proficient in from his previous life.\nFeigning sickness!\nI'll begin acting sick tomorrow. I'll eat very little, and sleep before eight... This way, the butler and servants wouldn't disturb me... But if there's an emergency, what do I do when Walter and company knock on the door? A Magician's Illusion Creation can only fool the eyes. It isn't some artificial intelligence... Artificial intelligence... Right, I can fix the illusion onto a mirror, letting it look like Dwayne Dant\u00e8s. Then, I'll get Arrodes to answer remotely!With this in mind, Klein's thoughts suddenly opened up.\nI have to say that Arrodes can be quite useful at times...After a poignant comment, Klein returned to the real world. He walked to the desk, took out pen and paper, and began drawing a picture comprising of symbols that implied secrecy and mystery prying.\nJust as he finished his final stroke, the room's lighting dimmed suddenly. The full-body mirror first turned deep black before silver light surfaced. Loenese text appeared one after another.\n\"Great Master, your loyal and humble servant, Arrodes, heard your summoning. W-was I late?\"\nThere's something new every time...Klein shook his head in amusement.\n\"No.\"\n\"How tolerant you are of me, Great Master. You can ask your question.\" Words neatly appeared on the mirror.\nKlein thought for a moment before saying, \"I plan on eliminating the Aurora Order Oracle, Mr. X. Do you have any suggestions?\"\nThe full-body mirror's words froze for a few seconds before changing.\n\"It's best you do it after Thursday.\"\nIt's in line with my divination... Angel of Fate Ouroboros or a Saint of the Aurora Order might be around Mr. X tonight and on Thursday...Klein smiled and said, \"Arrodes, I have something that requires your help.\"\n\"T-this is my honor! You are giving me an opportunity!\" Words quickly emerged, fully professing what it meant to be excited and delighted. \"May I ask what the mission is?\"\nKlein nodded and said, \"This Friday night, I will be using a mirror as an illusion prop, changing it to look like my present identity... If any emergencies happen, you're in charge of controlling the mirror to answer without letting anyone discover any abnormalities.\n\"Can you do it?\"\nThe air around the full-body mirror suddenly gushed around, and a toady voice belonging to Dwayne Dant\u00e8s sounded:\n\"Great Master, I'll try my best to complete anything you command.\n\"Although it won't be able to last long, and it doesn't match my usual habits, it's enough to deal with everyone here.\n\"If you wish, I can simulate any voice!\"\nYou're more talented than I expected... It's not easy being a mirror these days... However, why does that final statement sound odd...Klein's facial muscles trembled as he said, \"When dealing with them, hide the nature of the question-and-answer game. Don't let others notice it.\"\nArrodes immediately presented a new sentence on the full-body mirror:\n\"I will play your identity well!\"\n\"Very good.\" Klein nodded.\nHe was truly worried that Arrodes would begin asking Butler Walter and Valet Richardson embarrassing questions. Questions like: \"have you fantasized about ladies you shouldn't have any urges for?\" or \"who do you think of late at night when resolving your physical needs?\"\nHe believed that with the magic mirror's way of doing things, it might very well carry out such an act without any forewarning. Back then, Danitz nearly broke down thanks to its questions.\nWithout speaking any further, Klein switched to saying, \"That will be all for today. I'll contact you again on Friday night.\"\n\"Yes, Great Master. Your humble servant already looks forward to serving you!\" Arrodes first conjured a single line before producing a drawing of a hand waving."}
{"num_chp":234,"summary":"It was the same dream divination, but this time Klein saw more.\nThe first scene was still the small, dark, squalid room with Ian Wright sleeping soundly on a bunk bed.\nThe second scene was the same sewer they had both gone to. Ian squatted in front of Zreal's mutilated body, reached out with his hand to rub the two rows of white teeth, and removed one of them.\nThe third scene was a busy and noisy street. The passersby were all dressed in plain clothes, some of which that could be described as old and tattered.\nIn the middle of the street, there were gardens and lawns, surrounded by low chimneys that were puffing out smoke. Ian, in his old overcoat and round hat, warily watched as he entered the telegraph office not far from the center of the street. Diagonally across it was the mall entrance to the steam metro.\nThe image quickly turned transparent. Klein opened his eyes, tapped his index finger on the edge of the long bronze table and made a preliminary judgment.\nFrom that tooth and the telegram, it seems that Zreal and Ian aren't just a detective duo that found themselves involved in a dangerous situation. They have an organization behind them!\nI should be able to determine where the third scene is...\nKlein was in no hurry to deeply analyze it, as he didn't want to stay too long above the fog.\nLeaving the high back chair belonging to The Fool, he went to a corner, rummaged through the paper bag that he had been placed there previously, and found Meursault's Beyonder characteristic.\nHolding the crimson, jelly-like object, Klein sat down again and wrote a new divination statement: \"The corresponding potion name.\"\nAs he silently recited the statement, he held onto the Beyonder characteristic with one hand and the piece of paper with the divination statement in the other. With the help of Cogitation, he fell into a deep sleep.\nIn the gray, dreamy dream, the ambassador who was dressed to the nines, appeared again before Klein with his thin, stubbly face.\nHolding a bottle of crimson liquid, he said to Meursault, \"Drink it, drink this Hunter potion, and you'll rule the Zmanger gang. Of course, money is also indispensable, as Emperor Roselle once said-a stick in one hand and a carrot in the other.\"\n\"Hunter? Backlund is a huge metropolitan city...\" Meursault frowned and asked curiously.\nTo someone illiterate like him, hunters were associated with the wilderness and animals.\nThe middle-aged ambassador chuckled and said, \"The biggest city is the largest dark forest.\n\"Here, everyone has two identities. One, the prey, and the other, the hunter.\n\"Even the weakest hunter is a hunter. It's possible for them to harm stronger prey.\n\"Go, join this magnificent hunt.\"\n...\nThe scene shattered and turned into countless specks of light. Klein looked down at the crimson Beyonder characteristic in his hand and said to himself silently,So it's the Hunter potion. It's no wonder Meursault was so good at fighting. He even used a blowpipe to shoot poison darts.\nIt's no wonder how he was able to track me here...\nHowever, he doesn't seem to fully understand the essence of being a Hunter. He didn't set any traps ahead of time or use any weapons. He didn't put his advantages to use... This is partly because he didn't know that I'm also a Beyonder, one that happens to be a Sequence 8. He underestimated me. It's also evident that he only recently consumed the potion...\nThe Hunter pathway is both wielded by the former Intis royal family, the Sauron family, and the Feysac Empire's rulers, the Einhorn family, as well as the secret organization, the Iron and Blood Cross Order, which appeared in the past two to three centuries. Taking into account his attire, that ambassador's identity can essentially be confirmed... a high-ranking diplomat of the Intis Republic, an ambassador of the Loen Kingdom...\nI wonder what that important item he's trying to get his hands on is...\nAs his mind churned, Klein wrapped himself in his spirituality and began the rapid descent.\nAs soon as he returned to his room, he immediately checked his surroundings vigilantly, but he didn't notice any unusual changes.\nPhew.Klein let out a silent breath. He felt a bit more confident that he would be able to convene the members of the Tarot Club on time tomorrow afternoon.\nHe rummaged through the map of Backlund that he had bought on the steam locomotive, looking for a telegraph office that was along the subway line, one that wasn't far from the middle of the street.\nThere were only a few subway lines in Backlund, so Klein quickly identified three targets: one in West Borough, one in St. George Borough, and one at the junction of East Borough and the Backlund Bridge.\nHe recalled how most of the pedestrians in his dream were dressed to determined their socioeconomic statuses and arrived at the final answer.\nThe third spot!\nThe place where the East Borough intersected with the Backlund Bridge!\nSometimes, interpreting a revelation requires a plethora of practical knowledge and the ability to infer...Klein mocked himself, walked to the desk, and added another sentence after the previous statement, adding more to the contents written on the piece of paper.\nI don't know where Ian is. I haven't seen him since we discovered Zreal's corpse. However, I learned through my own channels that Ian Wright had appeared at the telegraph office on Bacardi Street.\nAfter he finished writing, Klein didn't fold the piece of paper and put it away. Nor did he burn it with his spirituality. Instead, he allowed it to remain spread out on the desk, freely revealing its contents.\nAfter giving it a deep look, Klein went back to the bed and took off his clothes to sleep.\nOutside the tightly closed curtains, the crimson moon peeked out from the layers of clouds, shining brightly and perfectly.\n...\nIn a house at Hillston Borough.\nFors, who didn't sleep with Xio, sat up suddenly and put her hands to her head.\nHer relatively pretty face was extremely twisted as if she was a devil.\nFors pressed against her ears and constantly tossed about in bed, as though she was resisting the illusory muttering.\nSweat trickled down her forehead, and veins bulged on the back of her hands.\nHer body randomly tensed up or rolled. Her originally teasing and languid pale blue eyes were filled with pain.\nIn the depths of those pupils, countless layers of light and shadows seemed to appear.\n\"No!\" Fors finally couldn't hold it in anymore as she let out a low tragic cry.\nHer hands stopped covering her ears and resorted to yanking at her hair, as though she was going to fight pain with pain.\nAfter a few minutes of writhing, she finally stopped.\nShe released her hands, looked at the handful of slightly curled brown hair, and weakly laughed at herself.\n\"I lied to Xio, telling her that the murmurs every full moon don't have much of a negative effect on me... At least losing hair is a serious concern...\"\nWith difficulty, Fors sat up and looked at the curtain that half covered the window. Through it, she could see the dreamy crimson moon outside.\n\"It's getting worse each and every time. Will I lose control the next time because of this...\" Fors could no longer suppress the weakness that she had buried deep in her heart.\nShe had attempted to separate herself from the bracelet that allowed people to teleport through the spiritual world, but it no longer resulted in the disappearance of the murmurs during a full moon.\nShe had tried to take sedatives, had tried chanting the name of the God of Steam and Machinery, had tried some ritualistic magic, but it hadn't changed the fact that she was gradually slipping into the abyss.\n\"If only I could understand what the murmurs are saying... I wish to die in the know, and not be buried clueless... P-perhaps, I might be able to hear it clearer after advancing to Sequence 8? But I've never encountered anyone selling the Trickmaster potion formula.\" Fors looked out the window in a daze as her eyes were dyed red by the moonlight.\n...\nOn Monday morning, Klein woke up early from his restless sleep and got out of bed.\nHe went to his desk and began to draw the curtains and open the window to let the light and wind into the room.\nAt that moment, he caught sight of the paper on the desk at the corner of his eye.\nIt was facing the window, maintaining its original spot.\nHowever, Klein clearly remembered that before he slept, this piece of paper was facing the chair and the bed!\nIt had flipped over and changed orientation after a night's sleep!\nKlein's pupils constricted as he abruptly reached out and pulled the curtains open. He saw that the oriel windows were still shut tight, not letting even a waft of wind in!\nWithout any wind, the paper had rotated hundred and eighty degrees by itself!\nNo, someone came in without me noticing!Klein felt a chill run up his spine to his head.\nHe was shocked that he didn't realize it while sleeping!\nThis meant that he was almost at the mercy of others, and his life and death depended solely on the other party's mood and thoughts!\nWas it a member of the military's special department, or was it a powerful Beyonder sent by the ambassador? From the fact that the paper wasn't returned to its original orientation, it's more likely to be the latter, indicating a certain level of warning... To be able to sneak in like that without a trace, how incredible... Should I thank him for his kindness? No, there must be a reason why he didn't do something that could've been so conveniently accomplished... They don't want to alarm the members of the military's special department who are monitoring the area?Klein couldn't help but think of countless reasons.\nThe reason he wrote those words last night and spread the paper on the desk, was to let others see it. He wanted to let the ambassador know what he wanted to know and delay any possible acts of revenge until the matter was over so that he himself could have more time to prepare.\nHowever, Klein had expected that the other party would sneak into the room while he was out, and when the surveillance of his house by the special military department would be reduced. Who knew that the person in question was able to bypass the Beyonders around him and quietly enter the bedroom while he was still sleeping.\nThe feeling of having his fate controlled by someone else was extremely uncomfortable!\nA Beyonder who's very powerful or with extremely odd abilities...Klein turned his back and faced away from the oriel window and pulled out a copper penny.\n\"Someone sneaked into this room last night.\"\n...\nHe silently chanted the statement, and with the help of his body's concealment, he flicked the coin.\nThe coin tumbled in the air and fell without exceeding Klein's shoulder height and landed in his open palm.\nThis time, the number faced up.\nIt was a negative result.\nNo one had sneaked into Klein's bedroom last night!\nThe paper wouldn't have turned around for no reason... Could it be sleepwalking? No, I can even stay awake after the Captain invaded my dream...Klein suddenly frowned and thought of two possibilities.\nFirst, the divination was disrupted and resulted in misleading results.\nTwo, the one who sneaked in was not human!"}
{"num_chp":1019,"summary":"\"How was it? Did you take a good look?\" Just as Fors left the street where Viscount Stratford's mansion was, she saw Xio walk out with a down and vacant expression.\nXio nodded hesitantly.\n\"I did...\"\nHaving said that, she seemed to come to her senses and said in shock, \"I know her-no, him!\"\n\"Him?\" Fors was confused.\nXio habitually observed her surroundings before saying, \"He's Sherman! The Sherman I told you about!\n\"H-he actually became a woman!\"\nFors was stunned as she subconsciously asked, \"Were you mistaken?\n\"Could she be Sherman's sister?\"\nXio firmly shook her head.\n\"No, she admitted it herself and even told me not to disturb her. She wants to bid farewell to her past!\n\"But... how did he become a woman...\"\nFors's eyes darted around as she suddenly recalled something. She said in thought, \"It's not impossible either... There's a Beyonder pathway that allows a man to become a woman at a certain stage.\"\nShe recalled Miss Justice mentioning something similar during a free exchange session.\n\"Ah? Really?\" Xio's widened as she asked in disbelief.\nYes!\" Fors had already recalled the exact conditions as she gave a rather confident answer.\n\"This...\" Xio was momentarily unable to accept it, but she couldn't find a rebuttal. All she could do was ask, \"Which pathway is it?\"\nFors replied, \"Demoness!\n\"Uh, it's the Assassin pathway.\"\n\"Demoness... Sherman actually became a Demoness...\" Xio repeated to herself.\nSuddenly, her voice became louder.\n\"Could it be that she's being taken advantage of?\n\"No, I must warn her!\"\nJust as she said that, Xio turned around and ran with great strides in an attempt to catch up with the rental carriage again.\nHowever, she couldn't find the target after attempting to pursue it for a few blocks. Sherman and the carriage seemed to have disappeared into thin air.\nXio gradually slowed down and finally stopped. She looked at the bustling streets ahead of her with a complicated expression.\nBehind her, Fors passed through a few walls and finally caught up to her.\n\"Gone...\" Xio whispered.\nFors also cast her gaze forward and thoughtfully replied, \"We were discovered...\"\nWithout waiting for Xio to speak, she turned around and sighed.\n\"Let's return and find another opportunity.\"\nXio didn't take a step forward as she continued standing there.\nAfter a few seconds, she said under Fors's puzzled gaze, \"Since they discovered a problem, will they speed up their plans ahead of time?\"\n\"It's possible! If they don't wish for their plans to be foiled, they might attempt one final strike tonight before we're prepared!\" Fors immediately agreed with Xio. \"Let's return to Viscount Stratford's place and hide in a more concealed spot. We'll continue monitoring it!\"\nXio immediately nodded and replied without any hesitation, \"Okay.\"\nIn the dock area, inside a warehouse with plenty of goods.\nShermane was sitting on a dirty wooden crate. Her hands were crossed behind her back as her body had thin but firm spider webs coiled around her.\nShe appeared as though she was encased in a transparent cocoon, unable to make a single sound.\n\"It's not a bad thing for you.\" Trissy stood in front of Shermane with a pitch-black flame that resembled ink burning in her palm. \"At the very least, you can determine if he really loves you or is lying to you.\"\nShermane was angry and afraid. She desperately used her whimpers to express her wish, but Trissy was unmoved. She turned her flame-wielding palm around and pressed it into Shermane's stomach.\nThe flames seemed to have intelligence as they scattered like flowing water. Following that, they penetrated her skin and flesh in an attempt to drill inside.\nTrissy's smooth, black hair flared up in defiance of the laws of nature. They were being pulled by invisible hands as they extended out in every direction. It stained the surrounding air with a peculiar smell.\nThe strands of hair thickened as they scattered into distinct strands.\nBeneath them, dark beams of light surged, bringing about curses and words. They flowed rapidly, fusing into the pitch- black flames. Upon entering Shermane's stomach, they quickly vanished.\nShermane's face twitched uncontrollably, but she didn't feel any pain. It was as though it was purely on reflex.\nShe soon calmed down as she saw Trissy's figure turn faint and gradually turn transparent until it vanished.\nShermane's pupils widened as she struggled again, but she was unable to break free from her restraints.\nShe tried again and again like a flood was rising, centimeter by centimeter, inside the silent warehouse.\nAfter an unknown period of time, the door to the warehouse opened with a thud and slammed into the two sides of the wall.\nA figure staggered in-it was the middle-aged Viscount Stratford.\nHe didn't wear his white wig like he always did while outside. This revealed his rather high receding hairline and rather messy black hair. The latter was stuck together as though it had been drenched by a storm and was air-dried. But in the past few hours, the clouds were thin and the crimson moon high in the sky. It hadn't rained at all.\nDrops of sweat dripped down Viscount Stratford's rather cut facial contours as there were countless black threads flowing beneath his skin.\nHis body was slightly hunched, and his facial muscles were somewhat twisted. His eyes were filled with pain and concern.\nHe surveyed the area and was delighted when he found Shermane. However, he turned anxious as he charged over without much confidence.\nWhen Shermane saw him enter the warehouse, her face lit up as though it was covered in a halo.\nShe then revealed a worried and fearful expression as she attempted to shake her head frantically. However, her neck was held firmly by the spider webs that prevented her movement.\nShe reeled in anxiety, to the point of tears flowing out of her eyes, drop after drop-crystalline and frail.\nJust as Viscount Stratford was about to reach her, a loud bang suddenly rang out between the two.\nIt was as though there was an invisible wall that separated him from Shermane, one that was couldn't be surpassed.\n\"If you wish to break the curse and take her away, you have to answer my question without hiding anything.\" At this moment, a figure quickly appeared in a comer of the warehouse.\nHer facial features were charming, forming together into an abnormally sweet look. She resembled the lover that every young lad would fantasize about in his youth. She was none other than Demoness Trissy.\nWithout waiting for Viscount Stratford's response, she raised her right hand and conjured a pitch-black flame.\nViscount Stratford's face, hands, neck, and exposed skin instantly turned transparent as they protruded with blood vessels.\nAnd in every blood vessel, there was a black flame silently burning as it flowed silently.\nThe pain in Viscount Stratford's eyes immediately reached a peak, but it vanished the next moment.\nHis expression turned extremely cold as a jibing look appeared in his eyes. It was as though the one being cursed wasn't him, but Trissy who was a distance away.\nTrissy, who was in the corner of the warehouse, suddenly burst into black flames. Dense, countless spider webs appeared, but they couldn't be lit up.\nIn the blink of an eye, Trissy was like Shermane, being sealed inside a transparent cocoon. She couldn't move or escape.\nIn a ventilation vent high above the warehouse, a figure appeared. It was a woman whose age wasn't obvious. She wore a simple and sacred white robe. She had black hair, blue eyes, looking sweet and beautiful, giving off an indescribable charm.\n\"Katarina Pelle...\" Trissy seemed to expend all her strength before she shouted a name.\nAt this moment, Viscount Stratford grabbed at his body, pulling out an illusory doll covered in thick black flames.\nHe glanced at Shermane and smiled at Trissy.\n\"When it comes to matters related to life, I would never be careless. After that fellow, Sikes, died, I knew that it would be my turn one day.\n\"Heh heh, since you're hunting me, it means there are obviously others who wish to hunt you. We're very patient, afraid of scaring you away. We did nothing and waited until today.\n\"Also, your gift was pretty good.\"\nUpon hearing Viscount Stratford's words, Shermane, who was still struggling out of habit, instantly stopped moving. Her expression turned blank.\nHer eyes widened, but there wasn't any focus. The look in her eyes seemed to sink deeper and deeper. \"Love...\" Trissy suddenly laughed, seemingly mocking herself.\nShe wasn't nervous at all.\nMaygur Manor. Night had fallen.\nAfter settling more than twenty guests and preparing the hunting trip the next day, Klein woke up not long after he fell asleep.\nHis intuition had been triggered as a scene formed in his mind.\nBrigadier General Qonas Kilgor, who was wearing a shirt and pants, had flown out of the guest room's window in secret. He landed outside in complete defiance of the laws of nature.\nThis... I haven't even taken action... He came here for his own goals... With a thought, Klein controlled a cockroach outside and turned it into his marionette. He then used its \"eyes\" to observe the surroundings.\nAlmost at the same time, Qonas Kilgor appeared.\nAfter this demigod left Maygur Manor, he immediately distorted the \"distance\" and quickly arrived by the bank of the Tussock River. He prepared himself to cross it.\nThe cockroach watched quietly without any reaction.\nHe's heading for the south bank of the Tussock River... What does he want to do... Does he have the preference of hunting in the suburbs so that he can attempt to conceal such actions? He also introduced Maygur Manor to me for this reason? Klein lay in bed and seriously analyzed Qonas's actions.\nAfter the MI9 demigod stepped onto the south bank of the Tussock River, Klein suddenly recalled a matter:\nBack when he escaped the underground ruins where Ince Zangwill and company were, he appeared somewhere in the northwest of Backlund. This was the south bank of the Tussock River, making it rather close to where Maygur Manor was."}
{"num_chp":1230,"summary":"As he had personal experience, Klein placed himself in the shoes of the Dark Demonic Wolf and pondered.\nUsually, he would shut down the automatic prayer response to prevent an enemy from using the feedback to establish a connection and lock onto his position;\nUnder this premise, to receive a sudden prayer from a stranger would no doubt lead to \"Him\" relying on the corresponding point of light to observe the supplicant and grasp more information. This allowed \"Him\" to make preparations for what might happen in the future;\nIf the person chanting the honorific name was a powerful existence like Amon or someone relatively more familiar, it would be best to destroy that point of light immediately. However, if the person was a stranger, under such a situation where \"He\" was completely safe, \"He\" would monitor him for a long period of time to understand the exact situation and see if there was a need for a counterattack. It was something that every rational creature would most likely do. At the very least, Klein would do so.\nThe essence of this matter was that non-Mythical Creatures were marked by high-level existences. They could die in a baffling and tragic manner at any moment. To the supplicant, this was equivalent to suicide or something even more terrifying. To the Dark Demonic Wolf, it was only a positive outcome, nothing negative.\nAt the beginning, the suspicious Dark Demonic Wolf would definitely suspect that there was a conspiracy. \"He\" wouldn't dare to establish a connection and influence Klein from a distance. However, with the passage of time, as the observations deepened and a confirmation was made that the other party was a non-angel weakling who possessed the aura of Sefirah Castle with signs of being unprepared, \"He\" would definitely find an opportunity to attack from afar. At the time when Klein was most unprepared, \"He\" would mark the prayer light and deal a remote attack.\nThis aligned with Klein's previous conclusion about his advantage that Klein-\"I'm very weak.\"\nThe only problem with this plan was that the initiative was completely in the hands of the Dark Demonic Wolf. Everything Klein did would be monitored, and there was no way to prepare ahead of time. Once the other party tried to exert \"His\" influence on him, he would not be able to fight back and wouldn't be spared.\nPhew, by doing so, I would successfully bait the prey, but kill the hunter as a result... It's meaningless... Yet, if I don't place myself in such a passive position, it will be difficult to bait an angel of the Seer pathway, the paranoid demonic wolf... This is something that a marionette or others cannot do in my stead... If only I can be certain that the Dark Demonic Wolf wouldn't rashly attack remotely because of \"His\" paranoia and will only choose to monitor and observe... Thoughts raced through Klein's mind as he sought out the possibilities amongst numerous impossibilities.\nWith regards to this, he could only sigh inwardly, feeling regretful for not being an angel from the Spectator pathway.\nAccording to his assumptions, the angels of the Spectator pathway would more or less have some special characteristics of \"the more others know about you, the more you understand them.\" When the Dark Demonic Wolf monitored him closely through prayer light and ended up carefully observing an angel from the Spectator pathway, \"His\" position would undoubtedly be exposed to the other party.\nUnfortunately, I'm not... Besides, the Spectator pathway's Sequence 2 might not be able to do so. I can only be certain that a Sequence 1 has this special trait... Summoning 0-08 from the fog of history? No, let's not talk about whether I can summon that quill without Groselle's Travels. Even if I successfully create a projection, the quill is a quill while I am still myself. The Dark Demonic Wolf's understanding of me doesn't make 0-08 do the reverse. Also, I can only use it for a mere two minutes. It wouldn't be enough to sense anything... It can be used as supplementary to the plan, writing the development I wish to see happen, making the Dark Demonic Wolf's \"choice\" appear reasonable so as to eliminate uncertain elements... Klein considered for a long while, but he failed to find a suitable plan to bait his prey.\nApart from feeling regretful that he wasn't a Sequence 1 angel of the Spectator pathway, he had also thought of the cosmos:\nJust learning of it would result in corruption from the cosmos!\nIf I had the nature of the cosmos, then after the Dark Demonic Wolf uses the prayer point of light to monitor me, \"He\" would be corrupted, allowing me to lock onto \"His\" position. However, the cosmos's nature is higher than that of an angel. How could I have it... I keep feeling like I've forgotten something... Klein made The World Gehrman Sparrow shake his head indiscernibly as he surveyed the area.\n\"There's no need to discuss the answer now. You can go back and communicate with the right person with suitable methods.\"\nHe focused his attention on The Star Leonard and The Hermit Cattleya, hoping that they would be able to get advice from the existences that were more experienced such as Pallez Zoroast and Queen Mystic Bernadette.\nAs for himself, he would return to Backlund with the aid of the historical projection. He would seek advice from Miss Messenger, Will Auceptin, and the ascetic, Arianna.\nThis is what it means to seek the opinions of angels or quasi-Angels before making a major decision... Klein made a self-deprecatory comment.\nWhen Leonard and Cattleya heard that, they nodded in unison.\n\"Alright.\"\nFollowing that, the members of the Tarot Club began discussing the situations of the various battlefields until the end of the gathering.\n...\nAfter returning to the real world, Leonard, who was resting in Saint Samuel Cathedral's basement, spoke in a low voice, explaining all the questions that Klein had posed to him and said, \"Old Man, do you have any suggestions?\"\n\"This is him trying to obtain the Miracle Invoker Beyonder characteristic left behind in the Forsaken Land of the Gods...\" Pallez Zoroast was first enlightened before he chuckled. \"Tell your former colleague that there's no way he can resolve this matter himself. I only have one suggestion. That is to seek help from The Fool!\"\nLeonard knew Old Man's character very well. He hurriedly asked, \"Is this really the only suggestion?\"\nPallez Zoroast harrumphed and said, \"That's a Mythical Creature that even Amon can't capture. It's possible only by relying on The Fool's help.\"\nOnly then did Leonard nod and sigh.\n\"It seems that's the only way...\"\n...\nTwo days later, two minutes before the meeting time that The Moon Emlyn had agreed to meet Maric.\nFors sat on a reclining chair beside the fireplace and listened to the commotion on the second floor. She cast her gaze at her friend, Xio.\n\"If the war continues, Backlund will definitely suffer more attacks. Are you really not going to evacuate your mother and brother to the surrounding villages?\"\nXio's short, light-blonde hair was parted in an asymmetrical fashion and was neatly combed. Compared to last year, she looked more serious and had the bearing of an adjudicator. She was like a high-ranking knight leading an order of knights.\nShe hesitantly said, \"The population in the surrounding villages has reached its limit. Besides, I can still get enough food from MI9 now.\"\nHaving said that, she paused and said, \"If the flames of war really reach Backlund, take them \u2018Traveling' to Intis and Feynapotter...\"\n\"It seems that's the only way...\" Just as Fors was about to mention the matter of her buying food in Intis a few days ago, she suddenly heard the alarm ring.\nShe shivered and suddenly sat up straight. She stretched out her right hand, which was wearing a red string, and grabbed into the air.\nHer arm sank as she pulled out Gehrman Sparrow, who was wearing a silk top hat and a black trench coat without glasses.\nThe cold adventurer's eyes rolled and gained consciousness, reducing the amount of spirituality that Miss Magician had to expend.\nHe nodded gently as he made the glove on his left hand become transparent.\nIn less than a second, Gehrman Sparrow \"Teleported\" away and disappeared from Fors and Xio's rented apartment.\n\"...\" Fors was stunned for a moment before the corners of her mouth twitched slightly. She turned to Xio and said, \"I think I'm just a tool...\"\n...\nThe sky was already dark, but the street lamps weren't lit up. Only the crimson moon illuminated the entire city.\nWhen Klein arrived at the agreed-upon place, he looked around and saw the unusually cold streets, the burning marks on the walls, and the collapsed buildings not far away for a few seconds.\nJust based on what he saw, Backlund was desolate and dilapidated. It even had the smell of gunpowder wafting through the city.\nAt this moment, Emlyn White walked out of an alley and nodded at the crazy adventurer.\nAccording to Gehrman Sparrow's instructions, he didn't say a word or bow. To prevent any delay in whatever precious time Gehrman Sparrow had, he led him to a nearby house and knocked on the door rhythmically.\nWith a creak, the door opened automatically, revealing a dark environment blanketed with faint moonlight.\nThe moment Emlyn and Klein entered, they saw the white-shirt and black-vested Maric sitting on the sofa. The door behind them seemed to have a life of its own as it slammed to a close.\nAfter taking a glance at him, Emlyn smiled and pointed at him.\n\"This is my partner, Mr. Gehrman Sparrow.\"\nJust as he finished speaking, he suddenly realized that the way Maric looked at him was even odder, as though he was examining an idiot.\n\"Long time no see.\" Maric immediately stood up, pressed his hand to his chest, and bowed at Sherlock Moriarty.\nSince the other party didn't appear in the image of Sherlock Moriarty, he definitely wouldn't take the initiative to mention such matters.\n\"Long time no see.\" Klein took off his hat and surveyed the area. \"Miss Sharron, please come out for the discussion. I have limited time.\"\nAs he spoke, he took out a silver adventurer's harmonica and blew into it.\nA figure wearing a dark and complicated long dress holding four blonde, red-eyed heads walked out from the void.\nThe messenger summoned by the harmonica's historical projection was an objective existence. It didn't increase the spirituality burden of Fors.\nAt the same time, Maric nodded and said, \"Alright.\"\nHe cast his gaze on the high stool on the other side of the room.\nEmlyn looked at the Wraith in a daze, then at Gehrman Sparrow and the spirit world creature he summoned. For some reason, he felt like he had been ostracized and didn't belong here.\nAnd on that high stool, a figure quickly outlined itself. Her skin was fair like a doll, and she wore an exquisite black regal dress and a small bonnet of the same color. Her blonde hair and blue eyes were slightly pale in color."}
{"num_chp":1289,"summary":"After returning to Biles's house, Klein pulled a chair over and sat down without waiting for Roy and company to make inquiries. He made a rather pious wish:\n\"I wish for my spirituality to be restored.\"\nWith that said, he raised his right hand, snapped his fingers, and granted his own wish; thus, allowing his spirituality to return to its normal state.\nRight on the heels of that, he extended his left palm, preparing to end the maintenance of the historical projection of the \"curtain\" before summoning a new one, so as to continue sealing off the spirit world area corresponding to Belltaine City. This prevented the Church of the God of Combat's chief shepherd, Larrion, from escaping.\n\"There's no need to do so. There's always a next time.\" At that moment, Arianna slowly shook \"Her\" head, indicating that Klein no longer needed to summon the \"curtain\" that originated from the Dark Demonic Wolf.\nThere was a limit to the power of \"Wishes.\" A Miracle Invoker couldn't satisfy the same wish in a short period of time, which meant that, within the next one or two hours, Klein couldn't recover his spirituality by granting his own wishes.\nOf course, to a qualified Seer-pathway angel, this limitation was something that could be avoided. For example, he could get Pasha, Roy, Biles, and Arianna to take turns to wish for Klein to regain his spirituality before granting their wishes as a Miracle Invoker.\nHowever, the problem was that, even if he could recover his spirituality that many times, he wouldn't be able to maintain the \"curtain\" which was at the level of a Sequence 1 for more than an hour. Furthermore, he needed to wait an hour before 0-02 erased all the previous rules and rewrote them.\nAfter some deliberation, Klein nodded slightly and replied with a smile, \"Let's give it a try first. After all, we're rather free right now. I'll give up after my last spirituality recovery attempt. Yes, this will purely depend on the chief shepherd's luck. Perhaps \u2018He' might lose control because of anxiety, frustration, and nervousness?\"\nAs he spoke, Klein dispelled the maintenance of the original \"curtain,\" and his left hand moved forward immediately after that. He pulled out a new \"curtain,\" allowing it to appear inside the spirit world that corresponded to Belltaine City.\nIn an area where saturated colors overlapped one another, Larrion, who was wearing a black robe with white edges and a square hat, felt the restriction disappear. Just as \"He\" was about to make \"His\" way out, he saw a new \"curtain\" descend, sealing him off again.\nThe smile on his face instantly froze.\nPhew... A few seconds later, Larrion slowly exhaled and composed \"Himself\" mentally as he continued to wait.\nIn the next hour, the chief shepherd of the Church of the God of Combat repeatedly experienced the despair and pain of having \"His\" hopes extinguished.\n\"He\" attempted to find the pattern and attempt to figure out the time interval so as to grasp the fleeting opportunity. \"He\" wanted to rush out of the barrier the moment the old \"curtain\" disappeared and before the new \"curtain\" was produced.\nHowever, \"He\" eventually discovered that the intervals didn't follow any pattern. The person stopping \"Him\" didn't restore the barrier only when his spirituality was about to be depleted. At times, the other party would recreate the barrier far ahead of time.\nIf it wasn't for the fact that Feysacian citizens weren't forced to change faiths from the God of Combat, and that the decree that Larrion was considered a traitor hadn't been widely spread, this Grounded Angel might've already lost control on the spot.\nAs time passed, Larrion once again sensed the collapse of the old \"curtain.\"\nHowever, this time, there was no new \"curtain.\"\n\"He\" has finally reached his limit... Larrion was delighted. Without any hesitation, \"He\" rushed out of the collapsing nascent divine kingdom.\nIn the next moment, \"He\" saw a woman holding four blonde, red-eyed heads, dressed in a complicated long dress, an unknown existence that was wrapped in bandages with yellowish-brown liquid covering the entire, and several strange but abnormally powerful spirit world creatures...\nThe \"curtain\" that Klein had summoned the previous times were Historical Void projections that had been tainted with Sefirah Castle's aura. It naturally attracted objects sensitive to it. He wouldn't even be surprised if Amon was among the group!\nThe smile on Larrion's face froze again.\n...\nBelltaine City, in Biles's rental apartment.\nKlein suddenly raised his head and looked up into the sky. He muttered softly, \"Impressive...\"\nFollowing that, he became silent again until the magic mirror emitted an aqueous light that reflected the noticeboard's current state.\nThe rules on the paper disappeared in reverse order of their appearance.\nThis meant that 0-02 was beginning to erase the rules that it had set up, and was preparing to redo everything.\nOnce the curfew order was abolished, the highly-focused Klein immediately pulled Ma'am Arianna and used Flaming Jump to appear outside the shrunken Belltaine City LIbrary.\nAs he looked over, he realized that, on the brass pages of 0-02, the speed at which the rules were being wiped clear had become very fast. In just a blink of an eye, the second half of the book was only left with the clause: \"All the following rules are ineffective.\"\nFollowing that, the clause disappeared as a new set of rules rapidly emerged without any gaps:\n\"The Trunsoest Brass Book is the most precious item. No living being is permitted to touch it...\"\nBefore this clause was completed, Arianna's figure had already appeared beside the rectangular table. \"Her\" finger touched the brass page.\nWith a crack, the leader of the Church of Evernight's ascetic had \"Her\" neck suddenly constricted as though an invisible rope had hoisted \"Her\" up.\nAs an angel, \"She\" had actually suffered bone fractures and had difficulties breathing.\nDeath by hanging!\nHowever, with Arianna's finger sliding over with some difficulty, the first clause that appeared was \"erased\" before it was fully displayed. It entered a \"Concealed\" state.\nAs for all the rules set by 0-02, it had to be publicized or announced before it could truly be effective!\nWith a whoosh, Arianna picked up the Trunsoest Brass Book and threw it to Klein, who was outside the window.\nIn the previous hour, Klein had already anticipated all the possible developments and had a discussion with Arianna. He was in no way nervous or flustered. While 0-02 was still in midair, he dragged another himself wearing a human-skinned glove out of the void.\nThen, he grabbed the Trunsoest Brass Book and used his historical projection to \"Teleport\" away.\nAfter his figure disappeared from his spot, Arianna landed on the ground with a loud thud, a deep mark left on \"Her\" neck.\nIn just a few seconds, Klein, who was holding 0-02, appeared at the top of the main peak of the Hornacis mountain range. He used his Spirit Vision at the level of an angel and saw the collapsed, dilapidated, and fogged palace.\nWithout any hesitation, Klein allowed his historical projection to take the Trunsoest Brass Book and \"Blink\" to the main door of the palace before pushing the door open.\nWhat appeared before him was a hall with many corpses hanging from above. Every corpse was different. There were men and women, either dressed beautifully, simply, exquisitely, or casually.\nBehind each of these hangers was a transparent and slippery tentacle with complicated patterns. They came from the depths of the hall-from that ancient stone chair.\nOn the huge stone chair, transparent and distorted maggots were formed into a ball. They grew wantonly and extended out strange tentacles.\nThis was The Half-Fool of the Antigonus family, who had lost control and gone mad!\nSensing the door open, and sensing Klein's historical projection approach, the cluster of maggots left the stone chair and fiercely flailed their slippery tentacles, causing them to surge towards the door as if they were being affected by an invisible suction force.\nSimilarly, at the bottom of the stone chair, the tarot card with Roselle's image, which was written with a stellar radiance, flew towards the door.\nJust seeing this scene pushed Klein's historical projection towards experiencing a breakdown. Thankfully, he didn't possess any sentience and was remotely controlled by Klein. He didn't suffer the chaotic thoughts and the negative side effects of the mental mutation, nor did he stand motionless and helpless.\nBefore the historical projection dissipated, it threw the Trunsoest Brass Book at the terrifying cluster of maggots.\nThe transparent and slippery tentacles sensed danger and instinctively reacted by wrapping around Sealed Artifact 0-02.\nUnder such interference and the invisible strong winds, The Fool card had reached the door one step ahead of the strange tentacles.\nKlein's historical projection had mostly collapsed. Seeing this, he mechanically extended his right hand, grabbed the Card of Blasphemy, and threw it behind him.\nIn the next instant, the slippery tentacles that were reassembled had reached out to the door, but they were blocked by the fog, unable to exit. All it could do was wildly pound at the barrier.\nThe open door slowly closed, blocking out this scene.\nKlein, who was hiding somewhere on the mountain peak, frowned slightly. He felt a sense of joy and relief, as well as a strong sense of doubt.\nIn other words, I used 0-02 to exchange for The Fool's card? The Goddess doesn't need me to seek clues regarding the River of Eternal Darkness for the time being? Klein silently muttered to himself. He walked out of the hidden area and arrived not far from the ancient palace. He bent down and picked up the Card of Blasphemy.\nOn the surface of the card was Roselle Gustav, who was wearing colorful clothes and holding a stick and luggage. His eyes were filled with a longing for the future, and behind him was a puppy.\nOn the upper left corner of the card, the resplendent stellar radiance outlined a few words:\n\"Sequence 0: The Fool!\"\n...\nInside the ancient palace, the Trunsoest Brass Book fell to the ground and opened up to the first page of the second half of the book.\nNew rules began to form:\n\"...The Trunsoest Brass Book is the most precious item. No living being is permitted to touch it. Those in violation are to be sentenced to death!\n\"...One is not allowed to change the condition of the Trunsoest Brass Book in any way. Those in violation are to be sentenced to death!\nJust as the two rules just appeared, and before it could \"inform\" the owner here, a line of words suddenly appeared between the two halves of the book:\n\"All the following rules are ineffective.\"\nAn hour later, the two rules were wiped out, and new rules were written. However, after just two lines, there was an additional clause in front of them-0-02 seemed to have reached a blank slate that happened when the entire book was filled up.\nAgain and again, the Trunsoest Brass Book fell into an endless cycle."}
{"num_chp":698,"summary":"Deities walked the land, and not in the astral world... In the early Fourth Epoch, during the era of the Solomon Empire, there was no distinguishing between the worlds of myth and reality. Deities directly walked the land without the need for a descent?\nThis is somewhat similar to the Second Epoch as written in the City of Silver's books. The Giant King's Court and other locations are separated by a door in the real world. They just needed to pass through it and return the same way. Mortals and deities mixed together in the chaos and darkness... Also, the astral world really does correspond to deities...After hearing Viscount Mobet Zoroast's description, Klein instantly began connecting the dots.\nHe subconsciously swept a glance at Groselle, as this giant was very likely someone who had experienced the history of the Second Epoch!\nGroselle picked up a cup larger than a wooden bucket and gulped down some melted snow as he laughed.\n\"Mobet, what's there to be surprised about? Why are you so solemn?\"\n\"I've no idea why I became so solemn either.\" Bit by bit, Mobet Zoroast revealed a smile. \"Haha, it might be something very normal for us, but in their eyes, it's terrifying and unbelievable. I have to use a suitable expression to describe it in order to achieve a satisfactory result. Do you still remember Frunziar's expression when we told him those stories in the very beginning? He almost knelt down to seek forgiveness from the Lord of Storms.\"\n\"...\" Klein, Danitz, and company were momentarily unsure of the expression of words they should use to respond.\nAnderson leaned over to Gehrman Sparrow and said with a suppressed voice, \"I think he has the talent to be a Provoker.\"\nHe appeared to be suppressing his voice, but his words could be heard by everyone present.\nMobet didn't mind as he chuckled before continuing, \"I know that you aren't very convinced and find it unbelievable that deities walked the lands, just like Edwina's previous reactions. Heh heh, I can give you two examples. The Chasm of Storm on Pasu Island and the Tenebrous Heaven in the Amantha mountain range were the divine kingdoms of the Lord of Storms and Evernight. They were divine kingdoms located on land. They were divine kingdoms separated from the real world by a mere illusory door!\nPasu Island? Isn't that where the holy altar of the Church of Storms is? The Amantha mountain range... Amantha means serenity in Hermes; this refers to a holy cathedral, the Cathedral of Serenity? When the deities no longer walked the land, \"Their\" kingdoms became the headquarters of their respective churches?Klein instinctively believed that Mobet Zoroast wasn't lying as he used it to come to certain conclusions.\nDanitz was puzzled and horrified by what he heard. He subconsciously wanted to leave, but when he saw his captain listening attentively, Gehrman Sparrow who was in thought, and Anderson Hood who wore a look of interest on his face, he could only hold back his urge as he sought a better, more comfortable seating position.\nAt that moment, the Elvish Songster Siatas, who was in charge of the perimeter, walked in and said with contempt, \"Do not mention that fake god. The authority of the storm only belongs to the king of us elves!\"\nHer voice was clear and beautiful, but her tone was filled with anger and irascibility. It felt as though she would raise her hands at any moment to shoot an arrow at Mobet Zoroast.\n\"Alright, I will use the words \u2018fake god,'\" Mobet raised his hand to adjust his sharp and hard black hat.\nSiatas retracted her gaze. She then said to the former Loen soldier, Frunziar Edward, who wasn't a staunch believer of the Lord of Storms, \"It's your turn!\"\nFrunziar raised his head a little; his expression in a trance-like state.\nApparently, he hadn't noticed the conversation and argument from before. He drew the iron-black sword beside him and walked towards the cave entrance.\nKlein observed for a moment and took the opportunity to speak to the elf, Siatas.\n\"Do you know of Queen of Calamity, Cohinem?\"\nHe wasn't actually sure if Cohinem was Elf King Soniathrym's subsidiary god, Queen of Calamity. His inquiry was for Elvish Songster Siatas to give him the answer.\nSiatas's gentle and exquisite face immediately produced a trance-like expression like Frunziar's.\n\"I haven't heard \u2018Her' name in a long time. \u2018She' is the queen of us elves.\n\"Mobet and Frunziar didn't even know of \u2018Her' existence...\n\"Where did you encounter \u2018Her,' no-learn of \u2018Her' situation?\"\nAs she spoke, Siatas's tone became urgent.\nAt that moment, Danitz looked at Gehrman Sparrow in surprise, reflecting over the revelation that the madman was so knowledgeable. He was even able to share a common topic of interest with an elf from ancient times.\n\"I never expected you to be a scholar... I really couldn't tell. Couldn't tell at all...\" Anderson sighed as he shook his head.\nVice Admiral Iceberg Edwina likewise cast her gaze at Klein. Her limpid blue eyes had a strong desire to learn from him.\nKlein answered frankly, \"I've once entered a ruin belonging to Queen of Calamity Cohinem and obtained some items.\"\n\"Ruin?\" Siatas ruminated over that word in a soft voice, her tone having seemingly lost something unimportant, but something that she couldn't bear to part with.\n\"From the situation inside, \u2018She' might not be truly dead.\" After seeing Siatas's eyes light up, Klein went straight to the point. \"Do you have the Ocean Songster's potion formula? Can I use something to exchange for it?\"\nHe felt that being honest and direct with a Beyonder from the Storm pathway was the best choice.\nSiatas thought and said, \"Use one of Her Majesty's items for the exchange.\"\n\"I only obtained a wine cup made of gold. It's already been crushed flat. Complicated patterns are engraved on it, with the Elvish phrases Calamity and Cohinem.\" Klein didn't hide the truth.\n\"I know about that cup. It was the cup Her Majesty loved the most,\" Siatas said, unable to hide her excitement. \"Deal!\"\n\"The cup is outside.\" Klein had no intention of heading above the gray fog in front of everyone.\nSiatas nodded.\n\"I understand.\n\"We will complete the transaction after we leave this book.\"\nHaving said that, she pressed her palms together.\n\"The Storm will definitely belong to the elves!\"\nBefore anyone spoke, she asked curiously, \"What else did you discover there?\"\n\"Some murals depicting the Elf King battling an ancient sun god.\" Klein shot a glance at the ascetic, Snowman, who believed in the Lord that created everything, the omnipotent and omniscient God.\nWith his back still facing the fire, the middle-aged man who was facing the stone wall finally opened his mouth.\n\"No, \u2018He' isn't the Sun God.\n\"\u2018He' is our Lord, the father of all things, the great source of everything.\n\"\u2018He' wasn't battling the Elf King, but taking back the authority which belonged to him.\nJust as Snowman said that, Siatas stood up and aimed her arrow at him.\nSuddenly, this Elvish Songster's plaited black hair flared up in violation of the laws of nature. The strands of hair were distinct and they were all swirling with silver lightning, emitting a strange deep blue luster.\nJust as Siatas was about to release the arrow, a huge grayish-blue palm appeared before her, blocking the arrow tip, without any fear of being struck.\nIt was the palm of the giant, Groselle. One of the traits of this race was its exaggerated limbs. They were so long that they appeared a little distorted. Therefore, simply by sitting there, he could stop Siatas by extending his arm.\n\"Alright, Snowman, cut it out. As you know, Siatas is an elf who likes to put actions before words,\" Groselle said to the ascetic before turning his head to the Elvish Songster. \"Siatas, we are companions who can leave our backs to each other. We have experienced plenty of dangers together. You can retort Snowman and even beat him up, but do not attempt to harm him.\"\nAs expected of the lead of the book. He's filled with positivity... But what's the difference in beating him and harming him?Klein couldn't help but mumble.\nSiatas grunted and sat back down, turning the mood heavy and silent with a level of awkwardness.\nGiant Groselle used his single vertical eye to survey the area before chuckling.\n\"Then, I'll talk about my past.\n\"Before entering this book, I lived in the Giant King's Court. I was one of the guardians of the Waning Forest. It's somewhere only our king can enter. Rumor has it that buried inside it are \u2018His' parents, who also form the origins of us giants.\"\nThe Giant King's Court is formed of many parts, and the Waning Forest is one of them? Buried in there is the most ancient ancestor of the giants?Klein listened attentively, only wishing to ask more.\nTo him, this was more valuable than the Fourth Epoch's history. This was because the City of Silver's hope likely laid in the Giant King's Court.\nHowever, before he opened his mouth, Edwina spoke before him.\n\"Groselle, what did the book look like when you received it?\"\nGroselle raised his hand to rub his cheeks.\n\"It had nothing, like an empty book waiting to be written.\"\nI even thought that Groselle might be a completely fictional character in the book...Klein deliberated for a few seconds and didn't directly ask about the details of the Giant King's Court. He turned to say to Mobet Zoroast, \"Do you know of Blasphemer Amon?\"\n\"Blasphemer refers to the entire family of Amon. They are the archenemies of us Zoroasts. It's said that they have a very powerful and terrifying ancestor that even Ouroboros and Medici viewed with great importance. They even feel fear towards \u2018Him,' but no one knows of \u2018His' actual name,\" Mobet introduced in detail.\nOuroboros, Medici? Yes, back then the True Creator and Rose Redemption supported the Solomon Empire...Klein's heart stirred as he immediately asked, \"Then, have you heard of the name Sasrir?\"\nMobet was taken aback as he slowly shook his head.\n\"Never.\"\nDark Angel Sasrir's name and title vanished after the Cataclysm? It was buried?Klein confirmed a fact through this.\nAt that moment, Snowman, who was facing the stone wall, said with a deep voice, \"Sasrir is the Dark Angel, the leader of the Kings of Angels, the one closest to the Lord.\"\nI was waiting for your answer...Klein cast his gaze on the ascetic and asked in a deep voice, \"Apart from \u2018Him,' Ouroboros, Medici, and Amon, what other Kings of Angels are there? You don't have to say out all \u2018Their' names.\"\nKlein was afraid that it would result in unnecessary reactions, just like the \"repenter\" in Afternoon Town.\nEdwina, Anderson, and Danitz were at a loss from the very beginning. This was because the contents of the conversation between Gehrman Sparrow and the few ancient figures were things that they had never heard of. They found it unbelievable that this crazy adventurer knew so many secrets!\nAfter a few seconds of silence, Snowman said, \"There's also the Angel of Imagination, Adam...\"\nJust as he said the name, the entire cave shook. The familiar and crazy tyrannical aura rapidly descended!\nKing of the North Ulyssan had arrived!"}
{"num_chp":664,"summary":"Mermaids?\nKlein felt delighted as anticipation and excitement filled him.\nHaving left Backlund for nearly four months and experiencing a series of events, he finally arrived at the destination of his travels. He was completing the last condition needed for him to advance to Sequence 5 Nimblewright Master!\nHis irascibility and frustrations had been constantly growing ever since he entered these waters, and it was all thanks to the waiting. The various ridiculous and humorous matters on the Future, the matters that seemed abnormally harrowing on careful thought, and the dangers and unknown things contained within the night, noon, and dreams in the ruins of this war of gods had left him even more mentally tense. He lived through every minute and hour with great torment.\nNow, the pressure from these emotions finally had a chance of being released!\nPhew...Klein slowly heaved a sigh of relief. He directly returned to the cabin and entered the room that belonged to him.\nWithout being flustered or letting the joy get to his head, he followed the planned sequence of taking out Azik's copper whistle and Will Auceptin's paper crane to interfere with the possible spying of Queen Mystic.\nAfter taking out the remnant spirituality of ancient wraiths, the pair of eyes from a six-winged gargoyle, drago bark, and a metallic bottle containing Sonia Island's Golden Spring from his suitcase, he spread them across his desk, entered the bathroom, and locked the door. He then familiarly set up the bestowment ritual.\nAfter setting up the ritual, he wasn't in a rush to go above the gray fog to respond to the prayer. Instead, he set up another ritual of summoning himself!\nWhile taking four steps counterclockwise and chanting the incantation, Klein arrived above the gray fog. He responded to the summoning ritual and used his Spirit Body state to come to the real world. He then brought Tinder back to the mysterious space.\nAfter doing all of that, Klein didn't relax. He came to the seat of The Fool, conjured a pen and paper, and quickly wrote the divination statement: \"The singing ahead comes from mermaids.\"\nTaking off his topaz pendant, he used divination to confirm the situation.\nThe singing ahead of the Future was from mermaids!\nAfter calming his emotions, Klein summoned the iron cigar case from the junk pile and made it land on the ancient, mottled bronze table.\nWith a snapping sound, he opened the lid and saw the pupil-less All-Black Eye sitting there in silence. He could sense the extreme madness and danger from it, but it appeared to be in deep slumber.\nAfter observing it for two seconds, Klein took out Tinder and slowly wore it on his right hand.\nAfter completing all of this, Klein didn't hesitate and reached out his right palm and spread his fingers.\nAll sorts of blobs of light surfaced before his eyes. Grayish-white, bronze-green, dark red, and black colors formed the foundation of this mysterious space.\nAnd inside the All-Black Eye, there was a flaring and flailing iron-black beam lingering around the remaining colors.\nWithout using his spiritual intuition, Klein knew with certainty through his understanding of objects that the True Creator's mental corruption was represented by this iron-black light!\nFeeling extremely wary, he closed his fingers and grabbed at the target before turning his wrist.\nThe iron-black light was instantly extracted as it fused with Tinder. Immediately, the illusory, evil, terrifying, and indescribable ravings boomed in his ear like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\nThis destroyed his line of thought as it ground at his psyche. It brought about a fracturing pain to his brain, but it was soon repressed by the gray fog's power and turned completely silent.\nKlein didn't think further. He followed his plans and reenacted the trial runs that he had practiced numerous times by grabbing Tinder with his left hand, pulled it off, and threw it onto the stone ground of the magnificent palace.\nRight on the heels of that, Klein grabbed the All-Black Eye which was now completely fine. He quickly replied to the bestowment ritual and passed the Nimblewright Master Beyonder characteristic through the illusory door and into the altar in the bathroom.\nHe didn't dare delay any further. All he did was glance at the evil-exuding Tinder which was tainted with an iron-black color as its fingers twisted and its palm cracked opened. He then used his spirituality to envelop himself as he stimulated a plummeting sensation to return to the real world.\nKlein opened his eyes, grabbed the All-Black Eye on the altar and ran out into his room. While doing so, he had a thought.If I allow Creeping Hunger to watch what happens to Tinder and its outcome, I wonder what its thoughts would be...\nComing before the desk, from the side, Klein took out an iron pot that originally belonged to the Future. He then poured 80 milliliters of Sonia Golden Spring into it.\nAs the pale gold liquid slowly spread out in a clear and transparent state, it made him subconsciously feel thirsty, as if he wished to drink a cup of it to quench his thirst.\nThe items-drago bark, eyes of the six-winged gargoyle, and the remnant spirituality of an ancient wraith-were thrown into the pot by Klein, causing different reactions. Finally, the potion turned into a pale gold color, but it looked ethereal as though it was weightless.\nAt this critical juncture, Klein became abnormally calm instead. He steadily picked up the pupil-less black eye and dropped it into the potion.\nHe had already confirmed that the True Creator's mental corruption hadn't penetrated the gray fog or returned inside the All-Black Eye!\nAnd this was something he had expected.\nThe All-Black Eye was instantly submerged by the pale gold liquid as the surface began bubbling.\nEvery bursting bubble made the potion turn blacker. About ten seconds later, all the changes came to a halt.\nInside the pot, the potion took form as a completely black liquid. Inside, it seemed to contain countless tiny worms that were squirming about, worms that couldn't be seen by the naked eye.\nKlein took out a gold coin and made a quick divination as a confirmation.\nAfter receiving the revelation that it was a success, he heaved a sigh of relief and poured the Nimblewright Master potion into a metallic bottle he had prepared and stuffed it into his pocket.\nHe didn't act in a fluster or rush. He followed the process he had planned by quickly clearing up the altar in the bathroom, and he retrieved Azik's copper whistle and Will Auceptin's paper crane.\nAt this point, he walked out of the cabin and onto the deck.\nAt this moment, the symbols and magical labels on the Future had once again lit up, forming a resplendent sea of stars. It significantly reduced the mermaids' singing.\nRumors claimed that the singing of mermaids could make humans lose their reasoning and turn irrational. They would then jump off their ships to become food for the mermaids.\nKlein subconsciously nodded at the window corresponding to the captain's cabin.\nAdmiral of Stars was standing there as her body swirled with starlight. The gaze she sent back at him appeared mixed.\nHave you recalled what you said and how you acted in the dream?Klein lampooned as he said with a calm expression, \"I need a dinghy.\"\n\"It has already been prepared.\" Cattleya pointed towards the shipboard without any signs of surprise.\nGehrman Sparrow had mentioned that his purpose was to seek out mermaids back when he hired the Future!\nSoon, Klein left the Future and the protection of the resplendent sea of stars. He headed into the ocean on his tiny dinghy.\nAs the singing grew louder, a voice seemed to drill into his Spirit Body, numbing his body, making him wish to hear more of it.\nThis was far from sufficient for Klein. Besides, his spiritual intuition told him that he needed to be closer to make the singing clearer so as to satisfy the requirements of the ritual.\n\"Storm!\"\nKlein took out a charm made of tin, and he summoned a controllable gale that could push the dinghy ahead.\nAfter an unknown period of time, the mermaid's singing increased in volume. They were so clear, it was as though they were singing softly by Klein's ears. Each tone stirred his Spirit Body, and the melody was intoxicating.\nKlein felt his mind adrift as he nearly jumped into the sea and swam towards the source of the melodic singing.\nHe tried his best to control himself and discovered many reefs ahead. Figures were seated at its edge as they sang.\nThese creatures with a human head had quite some beauty in their clear, pure eyes. Their breasts were lifted up high, but they were also covered by dark red scales. The lower halves of their bodies were comprised of massive fishtails as they rhythmically struck the reef.\nThe mermaids looked different and had different colored scales. From a human's standpoint, they were all a different kind of beauty.\nKlein relinquished his control of the dinghy, raised his right hand, and reached into his pocket for the potion.\nAt that moment, the mermaids sensed his approach and looked over.\nThen, these creatures, who were also known as sirens, stopped singing out of shock. All of them leaped into the water with a splash.\nDon't go...Klein feebly reached out with his right hand.\nIsn't it said that you use your singing to attract humans for food? Why are you running with a human here? I'm not a bad guy. I'm only here to listen to your singing...At this moment, Klein's heart was filled with \"what the f**k\" emotions.\nHe soon discovered that the mermaids' singing didn't completely stop. Further away on the reef were a few mermaids with their backs facing him. They didn't discover the fleeing of their companions, due to the crashing of the winds as they continued boldly singing.\nKlein's mind stirred as he thought for a moment and took out a charm.\nThis was the charm from the Sea God domain that gave the user affinity with underwater creatures!\n\"Storm!\"\nAmidst the incantation, blue flames enveloped the tin plate, making it vanish from the real world.\nAlthough the remaining mermaids noticed him, they didn't flee in fear. Immediately, Klein took out the metal bottle containing the Nimblewright Master potion and unscrewed the lid.\nHe made every second count so as to prevent any mishaps!\nAs he gulped the potion down, a somewhat bitter potion with a mustiness surged down his throat, into his gullet, and into his stomach.\nSuddenly, Klein found himself abnormally stiff. He felt as though he had returned to Tingen, back when he was being controlled by the strange puppet known as Sealed Artifact 2-049.\nHe tried moving his joints, but he felt as though they were filled with lead.\nAt the same time, he felt that tiny worms were boring into every one of his cells and into his Spirit Body.\nHis thoughts slowed down as his brain reflected the gradual loss of control over his body.\nThe mermaids' singing floated over, stirring those desires, the accumulated fanaticism and infatuation, allowing Klein to hold onto his final lumps of emotions. Through this temptation, he slowly escaped the state of petrification.\nA grayish-white fog quickly surfaced before his eyes as he heard the illusory ravings of \"Hornacis... Flegrea... Hornacis... Flegrea...\" Compared to his advancement to a Seer, Clown, and Magician, these ravings appeared staccato, as though they were being disrupted by something.\nIt's different from when I became a Faceless. The ravings are clearly much stronger. It can intermittently break through the obstacles produced from the fusion of the powers of the gray fog and reality... I can think again!Klein was delighted as he attempted to raise his arm.\nHis joints still felt heavy, but the feeling was weakening!\nAt the same time, Klein \"saw\" his present appearance.\nHis skin was yellowish-brown, like a puppet that had been buried alive for years with old bandages.\nFleshy tendrils were hidden beneath his skin as they squirmed, separated, and fused.\nKlein immediately outlined the countless spherical lights in his mind, and he used Cogitation to calm his present state.\nDuring this process, the mermaids' singing continued to reverberate in his ears, allowing his joints and muscles to twitch before the numbness slowly receded.\nAfter an unknown period of time, Klein opened his eyes, his body having completely restored to normal.\nHe took a deep breath and silently sighed.\nFinally...\nI'm finally a Sequence 5!\nI'm finally a Nimblewright Master!"}
{"num_chp":1235,"summary":"The silver-black, three-tiered accessory box with many embedded gems quickly opened, revealing the interior of the second level.\nIt was dark. Even the surrounding barriers seemed to blend in with it. It gave one the feeling that it was a pocket of infinite space.\nIn an instant, the darkness lit up with countless resplendent speckles, as if they had transformed into a miniature cosmos, a miniature universe.\nThese bright points of light rapidly spun as the surrounding scene changed several times in a second.\nWhat Klein expected was to move Abomination Suah, the Rose School of Thought Shaman, and many of their followers to the ruins of the battle of the gods. By making them leave the Southern Continent, they wouldn't be able to immediately sense that Klarman had been attacked. This way, they wouldn't be able to provide any timely and effective assistance. However, the second level of the Box of the Great Old Ones had an element of randomness to it. The act of sending things to the designated scene succeeded a handful of times. Most of the time, the selected destination would suffer an unavoidable change. This was something that couldn't be influenced with luck, and at the very least, no one below Sequence 0 could do so.\nTherefore, when he opened the second level of the Box of the Great Old Ones, Klein didn't know what would happen. It was the same as not using any Beyonder powers to cheat at gambling. He had to rely solely on observation to push out all his chips. This left his heart filled with anxiety. Of course, he wasn't too worried. No matter where the Box of the Great Old Ones brought him and Miss Messenger, it was impossible to harm him in any way. After all, Reinette Tinekerr was fake, the Box of the Great Old Ones was fake, and even he himself was fake.\nWith this in consideration, even if he was thrown underground by the Box of the Great Old Ones and faced a terrifying corruption, Klein could instantly dispel the Historical Void projection, enter Sefirah Castle to do a complete \"disinfection\" and sever all connections.\nBuilding on this foundation, he had the ability to help Miss Messenger's main body resist the corruption. Since it wasn't directly experienced-through the layer of a historical projection-the outcome was relatively better.\nThe only thing he needed to worry about was that the random scene selected by the Box of the Great Old Ones was where Miss Sharron and Emlyn were attacking Shaman King Klarman. That way, it would be equivalent to leading the main enemy force to head straight for his headquarters. This meant that they could only consider giving up on the operation, and he and Reinette Tinekerr would undertake the responsibility of helping all participants escape from the battlefield and escape the Southern Continent.\nThe probability of this happening was very low, but he had to be wary.\nAt that moment, due to the influence of Abomination Suah's aura, Klein's spirituality had \"frozen\" quite a bit. It seemed to bind his body and soul, but it still flowed into the Box of the Great Old Ones, maintaining its open state.\nIn the blink of an eye, the scene in the second level of the Box of the Great Old Ones changed, revealing a tiny, vast sea.\nKlein, Reinette Tinekerr, Abomination Suah, the hooded Shaman King, and many Rose School of Thought believers and subordinates saw endless yellow sand and the extreme cold of the night.\nOther than the projection of the Chained God, all the living beings on the battlefield were instantly transported to a desert!\nAs for the projection, due to the departure of Abomination Suah, the connection was severed, preventing \"His\" powers from seeping into reality.\nWithout the luxury of time to examine where he was currently, Klein dispelled the Box of the Great Old Ones and snapped his fingers, summoning a scarlet flame as he constantly jumped within them.\nHe had done so to avoid the attention of Abomination Suah, as well as grab the opportunity to complete the summoning of the Historical Void projection.\nAt that moment, he heard an extremely evil roar. His mind suddenly went blank, and he temporarily lost all his thoughts.\nThe scarlet flames he was immersed in came alive as well and, like a cage, bound him to the ground.\nWith just a roar and the influence of some auras, Abomination Suah had already restrained him to a certain extent.\nIf it wasn't for the fact that Reinette Tinekerr, who was in \"Her\" peak condition, was his teammate, Klein's projection would've been helplessly executed. Perhaps his actual body would suffer certain effects.\nAt this moment, the huge doll the size of a castle took a step forward and opened its tightly shut mouth.\nThere was no sound, but the distorted \"wood\" that was covered in pitch-black liquid seemed to encounter a flood dike. It repelled backward and raised the arms with strange protruding objects.\nThis was a curse that Reinette Tinekerr had been silently accumulating for a very, very long time. The root of the curse was the anger, hatred, and \"Her\" grudge that had emerged after \"She\" suffered an attack!\nHowever, Abomination Suah didn't show any obvious changes. \"He\" only staggered a little and froze for a second before returning to normal.\nHigh-level existences were always able to restrain low-level Beyonders of the same pathway. They could even exert a certain influence over space!\nAnd using this opportunity to escape the restraints of the flames, Klein used Creeping Hunger to flash to another side, avoiding the Blood Moon Arrow created by the Rose School of Thought's Shaman King.\nHe didn't dare to look directly at Abomination Suah. He seized the opportunity and reached out with his right hand to pull out from the void ahead.\nThis time, he didn't drag anything out.\nKlein continued Blinking about and repeated his actions. Then, he successfully dragged out a figure. It was none other than the leader of the Church of Evernight's ascetics, the angel of the Concealment domain, Arianna, who wore a simple linen robe and a tree bark belt!\nMy report from before worked after all... A thought flashed through his mind as he activated Creeping Hunger once again and teleported elsewhere.\nThe eyes of Arianna's projection darted slightly as her eyes instantly turned dark and deep. Following that, she joined in the battle between Reinette Tinekerr and Abomination Suah.\nWith \"Her\" help, Reinette Tinekerr, who was in a rather difficult situation and trying hard to create opportunities for him, finally managed to catch \"Her\" breath. \"She\" didn't get possessed by Abomination Suah, nor did \"She\" become a real doll.\nThe Rose School of Thought's Shaman King showcased his well-rounded aspect towards the Darkness and Moon domains. He attempted to use spells like \"Abyss Shackles\" to restrict Klein's movement, but the short-distance \"Blinking\" was simply too effective. Without the projection of the Chained God and \"His\" influence of the surrounding area, and the interference of Abomination, Klein was like a fish in water. He was free and relaxed. He only needed to consider how to deal with his enemy's spells every two \"Teleports.\"\nHowever, the Shaman King could hardly stop him in an effective manner due to the unpredictability of where he would appear next.\nDuring this process, Klein grabbed at the void a few more times until he dragged out a figure.\nThis figure had bronze skin, black hair, and brown eyes. His facial features were soft and his gaze was cold. He wore a deep black robe embroidered with golden thread. He wore a golden crown and was none other than the former Death Consul, Azik Eggers!\nAnother angel... The Shaman King's eyelids twitched as he watched. At this moment, Abomination Suah suddenly inserted multiple black arms into the desert.\nThe desert nearby boiled and was blanketed with a thick black liquid. This extended into the distance and invaded the void, disrupting the overlapping of reality and the spirit world.\nTaking advantage of the fact that his teleportation wasn't completely affected, Klein \"Blinked\" behind Mr. Azik. With \"Him\" shielding him, he quickly grabbed at the air a few times.\nHis arm suddenly sank and he pulled out a silvery-white snake's tail.\nAnother angel!\nThe reason why he dared to directly summon the three angels was because this Historical Void projection of his was summoned by Reinette Tinekerr using the Staff of the Stars. The spirituality consumed was borne by this Ancient Bane, not Fors.\nOtherwise, Fors would've already fainted the moment the Servant of Concealment, Arianna, descended. There was no way she could endure spirituality expenditure such as this.\nFors's purpose was to first summon Gehrman Sparrow's historical projection so that he had plenty of time to set up the ritual and bring the Staff of the Stars to the real world. Then, the maintenance of the historical projection would be dispelled, allowing him to return to the fog and have Reinette Tinekerr summoned another him.\nIn less than ten seconds, as Abomination Suah had focused his attention on Reinette Tinekerr and subconsciously belittled Klein, leading \"Him\" to not only losing the help of the Chained God's projection, but also being thrown from the state of being the one who had laid in ambush to the one being besieged by four powerful angels.\nWithout any hesitation, this Sequence 1 angel opened \"His\" mouth and chanted in ancient Hermes words. \"He\" had once again prayed to the Chained God.\n...\nWhen the Door of Summoning opened in front of Shaman King Klarman, just the extension of two trembling hands was enough for a thought to abruptly flash across Emlyn White's mind.\nThe other angel of the Rose School of Thought, the King of Curses, Barranca!\nThis was information provided by Sharron and Maric.\nUpon seeing this, Emlyn's mind tensed up. Without any hesitation, he waved his arm and threw the Vision of White at the Door of Summoning!\nThis was partly because he was experiencing a battle at the demigod level for the first time, so he couldn't help but overreact. On the other hand, he wasn't worried about losing the Vision of White. After all, it belonged to the Sanguine. At worst, he would repay it in the future over time.\nAt the same time, even without the Sealed Artifact, he still had other mystical items to use, such as Leymano's Travels.\nWith the notebook, Emlyn could summon the Unshadowed Crucifix to replace the Vision of White.\nAfter the eyeball-shaped glass sphere flew out, it continuously absorbed the light along the way, bringing with it extreme darkness.\nWhen it got close to the Door of Summoning, the Vision of White suddenly exploded into an extremely brilliant glow. Like a blazing sun at noon, it enveloped both the hands and the door, melting away all evil, degenerate, darkness, filth, and undead auras.\nThe full blood moon on Klarman's forehead was clearly affected. All the light beams were compressed to his side, preventing him from affecting his surroundings.\nSeizing this opportunity, Sharron's figure that appeared in midair distorted, turning into a human-sized puppet.\nThis puppet was identical to Shaman King Klarman. It had messy, black-and-white hair and a pair of bright red eyes.\nAs for Emlyn, he raised his left arm and revealed a translucent ring that was worn outside his gloved index finger.\nThe ring seemed to be made of light-red amber, and there was a blood-colored gem embedded on it.\nLilith's Ring!\nThis was a ring personally made by the Sanguine Ancestor, the ancient goddess, Lilith.\nIt could project a door that led deep into the spirit world for a certain amount of time, summoning an unknown creature.\nEmlyn wasn't sure what he would obtain. He only knew that, under normal circumstances, the summoned object was usually slightly stronger than him, but the possibility of directly pulling out a demigod wasn't impossible.\nAt the tip of the ring, the blood-colored gem emitted a faint glow as an illusory door covered in mysterious patterns appeared in front of Emlyn.\nThe door creaked open, the gap in the door widening.\nShaman King Klarman had just recovered his senses from the Sun's illumination when he saw a moon rise up behind the Door of Summoning.\nIt was a bright moon, one that was slightly silver in color."}
{"num_chp":1386,"summary":"Upon hearing Amon's \"you're crazy,\" Klein raised his head and laughed out loud.\n\"I just gave up according to your arrangements. It's just that it's more complete than you think.\"\nAs he spoke, an illusory brand appeared on the forehead of the ice-cold and bizarre mask he was wearing.\nIt was a strange door of light that was tainted with bluish-blackness.\nAs for Klein, he was also enveloped in something similar.\nUnder the translucent dark-colored cloak, more and more slippery and sinister tentacles appeared. They were densely packed and extended until they occupied the nearby sky.\nAs his dark eyes flashed, Klein looked at Amon and said with a smile, \"For me, instead of you becoming the Lord of the Mysteries, wouldn't it be better if we let the past \u2018Him' revive?\"\nAfter his mental state stabilized and he figured out the key to Amon's surprise attack, Klein's thoughts of \"giving up\" removed his resistance towards the Lord of the Mysteries's will in his body, allowing \"Him\" to further revive.\nIt was precisely because of this that he was able to control Sefirah Castle at critical moments and borrow the power of \"Error\" to avoid the collapse of the space created by Amon.\nWithout waiting for Amon's response, the corners of Klein's lips curled up as he said with a smile, \"After you were corrupted by Sefirah Castle and showed signs of madness, you immediately recovered and could use Sefirah Castle to create the effects of \u2018Blind Stupidity.' After releasing the suppression of the Lord of the Mysteries's will in you, you didn't enter a half-crazy state, as there are external powers helping you.\n\"You should have an extremely key important avatar. It might even be like Pallez's choice to lower \u2018His' level. It's sleeping at Adam's place, and it allows a Visionary like \u2018Him' to personally protect your mental state. As long as the awakening of the Lord of the Mysteries's will doesn't exceed the limits of what Adam can withstand, you won't go crazy here if you don't lose control there.\n\"Therefore, your most serious problem is that you have to maintain a normal connection with that body. Once it's interfered with, your condition will be in trouble. And this connection is actually very weak under Sefirah Castle's isolation effect.\n\"You deliberately showed a half-crazed state for two reasons. Other than luring me to find an opportunity in this direction and stepping on the trap you set up, you were also hiding this fact so that I won't be able to target this aspect while engaging in a battle with you.\n\"Of course, there are plenty of problems outside these ones. After all, you aren't fully prepared. If I had discovered these problems earlier, even if I was a King of Angels with the Uniqueness, there's no way for me to defeat you.\"\nAmon listened quietly and raised \"His\" hand to adjust the crystal monocle in \"His\" right eye. The corners of \"His\" lips curled up as \"He\" let out a sigh with a smile.\nUpon seeing this, Klein smiled and shook his head.\n\"You truly are powerful, cunning, and terrifying, truly worthy of the title of \u2018God of Deceit.' If it wasn't for the fact that I had long considered what I would do when forced into a corner by you and had no other choice, I definitely would've hesitated just now. And if I hesitated slightly, I would've already died.\"\nIn that case, Amon would completely control Sefirah Castle, preventing Klein from returning from the fog of history for a resurrection.\nAmon stared at the increasing number of sinister tentacles extending out from under Klein's dark-colored cloak. \"He\" slowly took a deep breath and said with a smile, \"The Lord of the Mysteries in you is about to truly awaken.\"\nKlein's smile had a nerve-wracking feeling to it.\n\"You can also compete with me on this point.\n\"Our next battle is very simple: It's a competition of who awakens the Lord of the Mysteries's will to a greater extent, a competition of whose control over Sefirah Castle is deeper. 50%, 70%, 90%, until we reach 100%. Then, with a bang, we explode and \u2018He' returns.\n\"What do you think? Are you going to take the bet? Let's see who can't hold on any longer first? It's very thrilling, very interesting, and very suited to your preferences. It's like the roulette that's popular in Feysac. Two people, each having a revolver and a bullet inside. They take turns pulling the trigger at their temples. Whoever gives up first results in his opponent winning. And if no one gives up and persists until the end, there won't be a winner. \u2018He' will be the winner.\"\nAmon's brows pricked up as \"He\" smiled without saying a word.\nKlein looked at \"Him,\" and said with a smile, \"Although you've always been pursuing thrills and are known to be a risk-taker, you achieve your goals most of the time. Not only do you not lose much, you often gain a lot. And in the few failures that you do experience, you only lose some of your avatars and some items. You've never suffered any serious injuries or been placed in a desperate situation.\n\"Your every action is a product of meticulous planning. Even if you fail, you will have a way out.\n\"Does this mean that you value your life more than I imagined? You do like thrills and seek it for pleasure, but to do so regardless of the price is just an image you portray. How can a real God of Deceit wager a bet with \u2018Himself' at stake?\n\"Of course, this is just my own guess. Perhaps it's wrong. Anyway, do you want to take the bet?\"\nAmon stroked the crystal monocle and made a tsk like Medici.\n\"You're really crazy.\"\nKlein replied with a smile, \"In the eyes of others, this is indeed insane.\n\"But to me, it's just a choice.\n\"Compared to you, I'm more willing to believe in the former Lord of the Mysteries. \u2018He' is a true Great Old One, looking down on the Universe from high above and treating most of the living beings as insects. This would make \u2018Him' distance \u2018Himself' from reality.\n\"Besides, I should still have time to get the Genie to be my witness. I'll get the Lord of the Mysteries to promise me certain things. To \u2018Him,' it's very simple and worthless.\"\nHaving said that, the corners of Klein's mouth curled up as he said,\n\"I won't lose too much, just myself.\n\"There are always some things that are more important than others.\"\nAmon maintained \"His\" smile but didn't say a word.\nKlein then surveyed the area and found the Magic Wishing Lamp and Trunsoest Brass Book among the floating fragments of the wilderness.\nHe immediately laughed out loud.\n\"Look, I didn't get punished. This means that I'm not lying. I'm telling the truth.\"\nIn fact, the laws set up by the Trunsoest Brass Book had long been abolished since the divine kingdom was destroyed during the star's descent. Later on, the Amons dared to attempt to use \"Steal,\" but Klein's main goal wasn't to prove anything, but to show his determination, firmness, or perhaps madness.\nOf course, what he said was the truth. He was indeed willing to put them into practice. Otherwise, there was no way he could hide it from Amon or exert enough pressure on \"Him.\"\nAmon smiled and said without a hint of panic, \"Sounds interesting.\"\n\"Isn't it? Let's begin,\" Klein replied without hesitation as his eyes turned darker.\nAmon's smile froze as \"His\" palms suddenly gathered together.\nBeneath \"His\" classical black robe, there were also slippery and sinister tentacles.\n\"His\" aura changed a little as \"His\" body seemed to have a dark cloak on it.\nAt that moment, Amon became more like the Lord of the Mysteries.\nHowever, \"He\" wasn't competing with Klein in the progression of the awakening of the Lord of the Mysteries. Instead, \"He\" was using this to deceive Sefirah Castle to create a corresponding \"Bug\" and creating a chance to escape.\nIf the authority of the Error were to take effect at the same level, it would often have different preconditions:\nFirst, the medium and target had to be similar enough; second, there was a certain connection between the two; third, there were certain logical contradictions between certain matters or objects; fourth, some of the rules were indeed incomplete; fifth, while not directly affecting the target, construct an \"Erroneous\" environment as a divine kingdom...\nIn this aspect, the restrictions of \"Fooling\" were even fewer, but once an \"Error\" satisfied the conditions, it would be difficult to defend against or terminate it.\nAmon now wanted to take the initiative to disguise \"Himself\" and satisfy the first category.\nThis was similar to the invasion of a virus. First, it had to make the other party believe that they were on the same side to avoid detection and then paralyze any defenses to achieve their respective goals.\nWhen a fruit looked like a strawberry, smelled like a strawberry, tasted like a strawberry, then it would basically be considered as a strawberry.\nBut in reality, there might be an exception.\nAt this moment, Amon's appearance resembled that of the Lord of the Mysteries. \"His\" aura was like the Lord of the Mysteries, and \"His\" powers were like the Lord of the Mysteries. \"His\" mental imprint was also similar to the Lord of the Mysteries. With the authority of an \"Error,\" it would naturally make Sefirah Castle believe that \"He\" was the Lord of the Mysteries.\nSuddenly, Klein's damaged The Fool divine kingdom completely collapsed. The grand and ancient palace and the mottled table inside appeared.\nThe grayish-white fog beneath Sefirah Castle rose and enveloped the space.\nThe grayish-white fog split into two waves. They clashed fiercely in a particular spot, producing vortexes one after another. They tore open a gap that led to reality.\nThe power of Sefirah Castle was at odds with itself in this second. It was as though it didn't know which Lord of the Mysteries to obey.\nAmon's figure immediately vanished, using Door's authority to rush out of Sefirah Castle.\nJust as \"He\" touched the edge, \"His\" body paused before being sent flying backward.\nAt The Fool's seat, the corners of Klein's lips curled up as he sat there. His glabella and the strange door of light around him became more obvious, as though they were corporeal.\nThis released an immense convergence force that reached an unimaginable level. It was like an invisible hand that pulled Amon back!\nAmon's body suddenly split apart, transforming into countless \"selves.\"\nAnd in front of every Amon, an illusory astral door appeared.\nSilently, the astral doors opened at the same time, but in the endless darkness behind the doors, slippery and sinister tentacles appeared, blocking Amon's escape.\nAt the tip of the tentacles, resplendent starlight lit up as they instantly enveloped the Amons.\nThe Amons couldn't help but gather together, turning into a conceptual cluster.\nThese concepts included but weren't limited to pointed hats, classical black robes, monocles, fate, time, keys, doors, bugs, and trojan horses.\nKlein slowly stood up and smiled at the conceptualized Amon who was now in a passive state.\n\"You can also awaken the Lord of the Mysteries's will further, but this is different from death. It'll definitely affect the body at Adam's side.\"\nA conceptualized Amon rapidly gained a physical form. \"He\" relied on the \"Door\" authority to escape from \"His\" current state.\nThe corners of \"His\" mouth curled into a smile, but \"He\" didn't respond to Klein. \"He\" seized this opportunity to use the \"Error\" authority to deceive; using an avatar outside that \"He\" had prepared ahead of time, it could be used to replace \"Him\" and swap places with \"Him.\"\nThis was similar to the swapping of marionettes in the Seer domain, but at this level, the principles were different. It wouldn't be affected in most situations.\nHowever, Amon still failed.\n\"He\" realized that \"His\" \"Error\" authority had been forcefully suppressed.\nAs Klein slowly got up, more slippery and sinister tentacles appeared around him. The smile on his face became more exaggerated.\nRight on the heels of that, Amon's eyes glazed over and the smile on his face froze as the crystal monocle lost its luster.\nAt the same time, the cold, bizarre mask on Klein's face squirmed.\nThe \"Blind Stupidity\" effect!\nIn the next second, he \"Grafted\" himself to a certain concept in the cosmos, and he used his authority to influence the corresponding environment.\nThe surrounding slippery tentacles aimed at Amon, like revolvers.\nIn Amon's eyes that were still glazed over, a supernova exploded.\nAn unimaginable sea of scorching light surged out, shattering \"His\" monocle and drowning \"His\" body."}
{"num_chp":1350,"summary":"Adam turned \"His\" head and looked at Klein. \"His\" limpid, light-colored eyes reflected the face that was stained with blood.\n\"His\" expression remained unchanged, and there was a hint of pity in its warmth. It was as if a god was looking down upon the world.\nKlein smiled at \"Him\" as his head cracked apart.\nThis trend on his body caused him to collapse into a pool of blood.\nIn the pool of blood were his clothing, the blood-soaked stake, and an ancient mirror.\nIn the corpse cathedral, in the divine kingdom of Visionary Adam, Klein had died a strange death.\nAdam, dressed in a simple white robe, looked at the scene before \"Him\" with gentleness and calmness. It was unknown if \"He\" had expected it or if \"He\" had avoided having any emotions.\nIn the ancient palace above the fog.\nThat crazy maggot vortex instantly stopped as they broke apart into numerous frozen, dead Worms of Spirit.\nIn the next second, these Worms of Spirit turned illusory as they became stained with grayish-white as though they had fused into the fog of history.\nThen, they came back to life. As they shimmered with a dark glow, they gathered together.\nIn just a few seconds, the Worms of Spirit reassembled into a figure. It was Klein Moretti, who had black hair, brown eyes, and a formal suit.\nWith the return of the owner of Sefirah Castle, the destroyed mottled table and the twenty-two high-back chairs rapidly restored to normal. The junk scattered all over the floor was piled up again.\nKlein picked up the Staff of the Stars embedded with various gems and sat on the seat belonging to The Fool.\nThe entire space above the gray fog quaked as boundless and mighty invisible forces surged out.\nKlein immediately nodded at the golden figure that occupied Bernadette's prayer.\n\"I will fulfill my promise.\"\nGenie laughed and said, \"It looks like you haven't inherited \u2018His' cunningness and shamelessness. Very good.\"\nAs soon as \"He\" said that, the blurry and distorted golden figure rapidly receded, no longer projecting itself on Bernadette's prayer light.\n\"Well done.\" As Klein separated a Worm of Spirit to respond to Queen Mystic's prayers, he lowered his head and made a wish to himself. \"I wish to be restored to how I was like before tonight.\"\nWhen his main body died, he had only taken away the core portion of the Miracle Invoker Beyonder characteristic, leaving behind the remains in Adam's corpse cathedral. He was unable to retrieve them.\nOf course, Klein still had a large portion of the characteristics in the Worms of Spirit in his body above the gray fog and the remaining marionettes in Utopia. Zaratul didn't need any additional Beyonder characteristics, nor did \"He\" want them to end up affecting \"His\" condition. Therefore, \"He\" didn't directly use the law of convergence of Beyonder characteristics to suck all the characteristics of the same pathway in Utopia. \"He\" collected them using a different method which was relatively slow and would require a certain amount of time.\nAfter making this wish, Klein summoned the \"curtain,\" draped it behind him, and snapped his fingers.\nInside the junk pile, the Seer pathway's Sequence 9 and 3 Beyonder characteristics that were separated from the \"curtain\" previously floated up at the same time, transforming into pure light dots that drilled into Klein's body.\nHis condition instantly returned to the time when he was almost done digesting the Miracle Invoker potion. Apart from the lack of a physical body, he was no different from when he was attacked.\nRight on the heels of that, Klein cast his gaze at Utopia, which was closely connected to him.\n...\nInside Utopia, the hooded, black-robed Zaratul, whose face was covered in white whiskers, stood on the roof of Saint Arianna Cathedral. Beside him were Roselle Gustav's, William Augustus's, and Abomination Suah's historical projection. \"They\" patiently waited for the door to the corpse cathedral to open and for Gehrman Sparrow to walk out.\nHe controlled some of \"His\" marionettes, dealing with a few of the mutated Utopian marionettes, leaving the remaining portion of marionettes which remained normal to the end.\nAt that moment, dense, illusory Spirit Body Threads suddenly floated up from the rigid Utopian marionettes into an infinitely high height away.\nThey instantly came to life and turned around, looking at Zaratul and \"His\" historical projections.\nThe pairs of eyes sparkled in the darkness.\nAt the same time, a huge shadow descended from the faint grayish-white fog, enveloping the entirety of Utopia.\nZaratul and \"His\" historical projections instinctively raised \"Their\" heads and looked up at the sky that suffused a faint gray fog.\n\"Sealing is prohibited here.\" In the next second, William Augustine's historical projection raised the sword in \"His\" right hand and solemnly made an announcement.\nThe shadow that enveloped Utopia immediately shook as many gaps appeared. It was unable to completely isolate the marionette town from the outside world.\nRoselle Gustav's historical projection immediately transformed into a torrent of information that surged towards Klein's remaining marionettes in an attempt to interfere with their movements. As for the historical projection of Abomination Suah, it attacked the shadow that appeared like a curtain in a bid to expand the corresponding gaps.\nZaratul extended \"His\" hand and \"Grafted\" the void in front of \"Him\" to another island in the Berserk Sea that \"He\" had previously fixed.\nFollowing that, as long as \"He\" took a step forward, \"He\" would be able to leave Utopia.\nAt that moment, Klein's marionettes snatched the opportunity before the torrent of information entered their Spirit Bodies. At the same time, they opened their mouths and chanted in Jotun, \"Leodero!\"\nIn the Forsaken Land of the Gods, with the remnant divine powers of a Tyrant, Klein could directly trigger the power of a deity based on this name alone, but that wasn't the case in the outside world. As for whether or not \"He\" wanted to punish the fellow for calling out \"His\" true name, it was decided by the Lord of Storms.\nKlein had his marionettes recite the honorific name at the same time only to get the Lord of Storms to cast \"His\" gaze over.\nAs one of the members of the five pathways of Omnipotence and Omniscience, the Lord of Storms was probably one of the true deities that didn't wish for Adam's plot to succeed. If Amon became the Lord of the Mysteries, the King of Space-Time, this Tyrant would be in a very dangerous situation. \"He\" would have to constantly worry that the son of the Creator would deal with \"Him\" and help Adam or the True Creator to ascend to the position of the Lord of the Astral World.\nTherefore, compared to the Evernight Goddess and Earth Mother, Lord of Storms, Eternal Blazing Sun, and the God of Knowledge and Wisdom were probably the existences who didn't wish to see Adam and Amon succeed.\nIf there was a chance, Klein planned on getting his marionettes to continue shouting \"Aucuses\" and \"Herabergen\"!\nUtopia's surroundings instantly turned gloomy, as if it contained the indescribable wrath of nature.\nBefore Zaratul could take that step, the night sky instantly produced different colors of lightning. They bared their fangs and brandished their claws as they wantonly expanded. They seemed to envelop the entire sky in a sea of lightning.\nBoom! Boom! Before the deafening sounds could be heard, the lightning blasted like a torrential rain at Utopia.\n...\nThe Rorsted Archipelago, New City of Silver, the top of the spire.\nDerrick Berg, who was looking at the source of the earthquake, heard the sound of doors and windows opening at the same time. Furthermore, it repeated thousands of times.\nAlthough it didn't bring him any direct danger, the bizarre change still made Derrick very wary.\nWith some hesitation, he prepared to seek out the current Chief, Waite Chirmont, and suggest using the god-level Sealed Artifact, Proof of Glory. He wanted to first protect the New City of Silver and the nearby New Moon City. Then, he decided to pray to Mr. Fool based on the progress of the anomaly.\nJust as he turned around and walked to the door, Waite Chirmont, who had a dark-blue symbol engraved on his head, walked out from the corridor's light. He said in a deep voice, \"The seal underground has failed.\"\nThe seal has failed... Derrick instinctively believed that it had something to do with the anomaly in Blue Mountain Island.\nCompared to doors and windows opening, the consequences of the seal's failure were extremely terrifying!\n\"Immediately use the Proof of Glory!\" Derrick said without hesitation.\nThis was a god-level Sealed Artifact that could be used for a short period of time. It had once helped the City of Silver avert repeated disasters in the Forsaken Land of the Gods, allowing them to persist until the present era and obtain salvation.\nDerrick's thoughts were very clear. He was using the Proof of Glory to suppress the other god-level Sealed Artifact-Gift of the Land. The suppression effect would soon affect the saint-level Sealed Artifacts that would have negative effects on the surroundings.\nWaite Chirmont didn't say anything else. He immediately made up his mind and brought Derrick underground using the light as concealment.\nProof of Glory required at least two saints before it could be utilized. This was also the reason why Waite Chirmont didn't immediately head underground and came to find Derrick first. Of course, if he wanted to make use of it simply, there were tricks to do so, but he had to be prepared in advance to brand the corresponding mark on his body.\n...\nBayam, Cathedral of Waves.\nA bolt of lightning shot into Alger Wilson's room, turning into a hurried voice.\n\"Your Eminence, most of the underground seals have failed! Only certain items remain in a balanced state thanks to their effects!\"\nAlger's brows twitched as he combined it with the phenomena of opening doors and windows in Bayam City happening at the same time. He sensed that something was amiss.\nHe immediately said to the void, \"All of you immediately form groups of three. Take out the Grade 2 and 3 Sealed Artifacts that won't cause immediate danger, or those with living characteristics from underground to prevent any chain reactions.\"\nThis way, the underground area would become uninhabited. The dangerous Sealed Artifacts wouldn't be able to cause casualties within a short period of time.\nWith the passage of time, when the anomaly of the seals losing their effects passed, the Mandated Punishers would have the time to deal with the items.\nHowever, the premise was that they hadn't lost control of the three Grade 1 Sealed Artifacts.\nOnce there was a problem with them, the negative effects would soon affect the entirety of Bayam.\nHowever, with the seal no longer working, it was very difficult for the three items to remain without problems.\nThe first thought that flashed through Alger's mind was to bring along the one whose negative effects had the greatest range. Then, using his own powers to make temporary restrictions, he would fly to the sea and away from Bayam.\nThis wasn't too dangerous for him for a short period of time. After all, he was a demigod. The biggest problem was that the remaining two Grade 1 Sealed Artifacts would undoubtedly cause serious damage to Bayam.\nAt least I did my best... Alger felt that this method was safe and could handle the subsequent investigations from the Church of the Lord of Storms. It was pretty good.\nHis gaze subconsciously looked out of the window. It corresponded to the few schools and the workhouses near the cathedral.\nAlger retracted his gaze and fell silent for two seconds before sighing. He continued, \"Leave the rest to me.\"\nHis words transformed into electric waves that transformed into silver lightning that flew underground."}
{"num_chp":1424,"summary":"Did someone enter my room?\nOr rather, is it a paranormal incident?\nErm, there's a ghost following me. It's normal to have paranormal incidents...\nIn that second, countless thoughts flash through my mind.\nAt the same time, I see a monster drawn on the page of the open notebook.\nThe monster is humanoid, but it's made of tiny squirming worms.\nThis sounds very bizarre and terrifying, but in reality, it feels nothing of the sort. This is because this drawing is very simple and crude. It resembles the random scribbling of a kindergarten child.\nNo way? Some brat entered my room? A relative of one of my flatmates? As I think about it, I pick up my notebook and flip through it quickly, searching for other traces.\nAfter flipping through two pages, I see lines of text:\n\"My drawing expertise is really bad.\n\"The main problem isn't me. I was once called a master artist.\n\"War is art! War is aesthetics!\n\"It's like I've had a dream that I often had. The dream is filled with such strange languages.\n\"I'm such a decadent fellow!\n\"We really are women!\"\n...\nThese lines of text weren't that difficult to read, but the things written down look very chaotic. It gives me a headache as I instinctively stop reading and close the notebook.\nThere's a problem with this!\nThis is like an incantation for dark magic!\nI've experienced quite a few things in the past two days. I barely managed to calm myself down as I cast my gaze towards the window.\nOn the glass window, the blonde female ghost that looks like she's cosplaying appears.\n\"Do you know who did it?\" I ask in a suppressed voice.\n\"It was done by an evil spirit,\" the female ghost replies with an ethereal voice.\nEvil spirit sounds more advanced than some spirit or poltergeist... As a modern youth who has played many foreign games and watched some foreign television series, I think the name sounds pretty cool.\n\"Er... Is an evil spirit more powerful?\" I ask after some deliberation.\nThe female ghost nods her head in agreement.\n\"Will this be more troublesome?\" I think of asking Madam Daly to exorcise the ghosts again, but I'm also worried that she won't be able to deal with ghosts at the level of evil spirits.\n\"I'm also an evil spirit,\" the female ghost says simply.\n\"...Okay.\" I don't know how to respond.\n\"W-what's that evil spirit's intention behind scrawling in my notebook?\" It takes me a few seconds to recall the main purpose of my question.\nThe female ghost shakes her head.\n\"I don't know.\"\n\"...\" I open my mouth and change the topic. \"How should I address you?\"\nI can't just keep calling her female ghost, right? That's not polite.\n\"Sharron.\" After the female ghost says that, her figure gradually fades and disappears from the glass window.\nSeeing that she's very calm and composed, I'm relieved. I tease myself, It's a huge incident. There's no use panicking. Just focus on sleeping!\nThen I wash up and go to bed. It ends up being an uneventful night.\nThe next morning, I wake up on time as usual. I laze in bed for ten minutes and take my time to leave the house. On the way to the bus stop, I buy a burrito that can virtually wrap everything.\nWith the burrito in hand, I take the bus and arrive at the company. I sit in my seat, then I get some water from the water dispenser and get down to eating breakfast.\nSigh, if I hadn't treated myself last night, then I should be having a cup of sweet soy milk.\nThinking of sweet soy milk, I associate it with the new product that has just been released at the store I frequently buy from.\nSalted soy milk!\nThis seems to be the unique way to eat in a few places. Soy milk with soy sauce added to it!\nI don't know what it tastes like... I eat my breakfast seriously and start preparing for work.\nAt this moment, Rozanne, who is almost late, rushes in with a huge bag in her hand.\n\"Here, have some beverages. My treat,\" she says to everyone in the office.\nShe's a lady with good personal relations. Including me, most of the people stand up and surround her.\n\"What beverages are there?\" I ask casually.\nRozanne puts down her bag and hands the bag to everyone.\n\"Aiya, I bought a lot of bottles to get what I wanted.\n\"They all have different flavors.\n\"Sigh, if you're alive, then you should have a gambler inside you!\n\"Come, let's see what I picked.\"\nWhat in the world is she talking about?... I'm beginning to doubt Rozanne's ability to express herself.\nHowever, I still understood the last sentence. I quickly reach into the bag and take out a beverage.\nI wonder what flavor it will be? Just as I have this thought, I see a familiar bottle design.\nIt's a bottle formed by twisted snake-like patterns!\nThis is very similar to the Assassin beverage I drank before, but the color is a little different!\nIt was black before, but now it's blue!\n\"...\" I quickly turn the bottle around and see the name on the front:\nInstigator\n\"Aren't you going to drink it? You don't like this? Why don't you drink this last bottle instead?\" Rozanne points at the last bottle in the bag, puzzled.\nThe beverage bottle is like a ball of extended flames. It's very cool.\n\"No, I'm just thinking, I'm thinking...\" I subconsciously refuse, searching for an excuse.\nAs these thoughts flash through my mind, I blurt out, \"I'm wondering if I should match it with some snacks!\"\nAs I speak, I take out the snack that was given to me by CEO Huang's non-blood-related granddaughter, Cattie Huang.\nThat small bag of dried mushrooms."}
{"num_chp":384,"summary":"In Empress Borough, the opulent villa of Count Hall.\nThe aroma of Feynapotter's top-quality Mount Saint Dersee coffee blended with the splendid fragrance of the Queen's black tea to create an intoxicating symphony of smells. They lingered around the elegant three-tiered high tea tray, that served delicious and delicate desserts.\nThis was the high tea party organized by Audrey.\nShe had invited her friends of blue-blood parentage, all who were fellow enthusiasts in mysticism. They sat around her, talking and laughing.\nUnder Audrey's imperceptible guidance, Jane, Murray, and the others became extremely interested in the Dark Emperor, the Hero Bandit who had appeared last night. All of them cast their eyes towards the noble-born Kance Leerhsen who had joined MI9.\n\"What Beyonder powers does that Dark Emperor have?\" the sweet-looking Christine asked curiously.\nAmong the few of them, the lowest rank among their fathers was that of a viscount. It allowed them to have sufficient status and channels to understand the existence of Beyonder powers and potions in their endearing pursuit of mysticism. But just like Audrey before, they were all unwilling to join the Nighthawks, the Mandated Punishers, the Machinery Hivemind, and MI9.\nOther than that, the families that they belonged to didn't have histories that traced back to a thousand years ago, and even the ancient aristocrats that had just been established in the Fourth Epoch of the Loen Kingdom weren't completely loyal to the royal family or to the upper echelons of the military. They weren't bestowed with any formulas, and even if they had Beyonder ingredients, it was unlikely that they could recognize them. They wouldn't even know how to use them even if they did recognize them.\nThis limited the possibility of Murray, Christine, and the others in becoming Beyonders. They could only look forward to it, but it was difficult for them to take that crucial step.\nAs for whether or not their elders had collected the potion formulas and nurtured Beyonders for their families, that was beyond their purview. After all, this wasn't allowed; if the King were to find out, they could use this as a reason to strip them of their noble titles.\nOf course, there were already two traitors in the living room: Audrey, who had advanced to Sequence 8 Telepathist; and Viscount Glaint, who had gathered one portion of Beyonder ingredients. It wouldn't be long before he became an Apothecary.\nThe tall, thin, young gentleman, Kance, took a sip of his coffee and said, \"I won't give you a direct answer. I'll just tell you some facts.\n\"Other than traces of a gas explosion in the dining room where the battle happened, various means were used to detect poison, substitutes, Specter's Shriek, bullets condensed with holy powers, and other elements. By the way, that Dark Emperor, no-Hero Bandit was in a specter state.\"\nIt doesn't look like the person who had killed Rear Admiral Hurricane Qilangos, nor does it look like the person who had dealt with Lanevus in the sewers... Is the person involved in Capim's case Mr. Fool's third adorer who stole the Dark Emperor's card? There are at least three adorers in Backlund alone... How many adorers does \"He\" have in total?Audrey's heart skipped a beat as she deliberately asked, \"Was there an intense Beyonder battle?\"\nMurray, under her lead, asked one step further, \"There were Beyonders at Capim's place? Relatively powerful Beyonders? And there was more than one?\"\n\"He's just a trafficker...\" Viscount Glaint unconsciously expressed his doubt.\nAudrey maintained her faint smile and curious gaze, patiently waiting for Kance's reply.\nKance laughed and said, \"Murray's guess is correct. I can only say this much.\n\"Do you want me to be locked up by Captain?\"\nCapim's place had more than one relatively powerful Beyonder...\nIndeed, he's not an ordinary human trafficker. He might be involved in many matters regarding mysticism...\nHuman trafficker... Could he be involved in some cult's sacrificial rite? Mr. Fool's adorer attacked because of this?\nIt was roughly the same with Lanevus. It involved a cult and sacrifices, as well as the descent of the True Creator... I wonder which cult and evil god is behind Capim...\nMr. Fool's goal seems to have always been targeting these evil gods... Is it really strife between the gods? Who knows how many grand schemes of those evil gods \"He\" has foiled...Audrey made many connections as her heart surged with emotions.\nOur Tarot Club's enemies are the evil gods!\nThe rest aren't qualified!\nDoes Mr. Fool wish to get the title of \"The Nemesis of Evil Gods?\" Audrey pursed her lips and chuckled softly in her heart.\nThen, she suppressed her emotions and secretly made a confession.\nAudrey, how can you do this? How can you use Mr. Fool as a joke...\n...\nAt noon, when Klein returned to Minsk Street, he found, as he had expected, a letter from Old Kohler who had paid a carriage driver to deliver to his mailbox.\nThis was their agreed upon contact method during an emergency.\nOf course, according to Klein's prediction, Old Kohler, who didn't know many words, could only use simple symbols to tell him where and when they would meet. To his surprise, it was actually written in neat writing when he opened the letter.\nWith a quick glance, Klein confirmed that it was identical to the handwriting in Daisy's vocabulary book.\nLooks like this girl was the one who helped Old Kohler write it... This piece of paper doesn't seem to be exposed to moisture. Perhaps Old Kohler had bought some in the event he needs to contact me urgently...Klein opened the door to the living room and read the letter.\nOnly taking off his hat and cane, he leaned his cane against the wall. He didn't take off his coat because the fireplace in the room wasn't lit yet, and the early November cold was silently seeping into his bones.\nThe letter was simple; after all, Daisy didn't know many words either.\nShe thanked the detective for his kindness and good intentions before telling him that she safely returned home, and she finally said, in a tactful way, that she hoped he would bring her vocabulary book with him the next time he came to East Borough.\nWhat a polite girl...Klein chuckled. He snapped his fingers and burned the letter, leaving no clues behind.\nHe decided to return to East Borough the next day and return the book to Daisy, as well as reimburse Old Kohler for the cost of the letter delivery letters, paper, and fountain pens.\nWith this in mind, he couldn't help but sigh and chortle.\n\"Captain, now it's my turn to approve the expense claims of others...\"\nWithout wasting any time, he went out again and went straight to the Quelaag Club, where Dr. Aaron was seen more often during Friday afternoons. Klein wanted to ask about Will Auceptin, the child who had played with tarot cards.\nAfter entering the Quelaag Club in Hillston Borough, Klein said to the red-vested attendant, \"A cup of marquis black tea and a serving of dessert. Send it to the corner seat of the main hall. Dr. Aaron, Reporter Mike, and the others are sitting there.\"\nKlein had already spotted the relatively cold and famous surgeon, Aaron Ceres, who was wearing gold-rimmed glasses, as well as Reporter Mike Joseph from the Daily Observer, who he had worked with twice and had a pair of charming blue eyes. He also saw the aristocratic equestrian teacher, Talim Dumont, whose frequency of appearing at the club was only second to his.\n\"Oh, our great detective is here, and we happened to be talking about you.\" Talim stood up with a smile.\n\"Speaking bad things behind my back?\" Klein joked.\nMike stood up and shook his hand.\n\"No, I want to hire you again.\"\n\"What's the matter this time?\" Klein bowed at Dr. Aaron and sat down at their table.\nMike chuckled and said, \"I'm sure you've read the papers? Capim has been killed off by the Hero Bandit Dark Emperor, and his crimes have been exposed. What a joyous event!\n\"And as a reporter, I need to have an acumen for the news. I plan to get a list of names of the girls who were rescued in East Borough from the police department to interview them. Then, I'll paint Capim's most cruel, most evil, and most unforgivable side to the readers of the newspaper. Of course, the victims must remain anonymous.\"\nHe paused for a moment and suppressed his voice.\n\"I also have a hidden objective, or should I say, I wish to use the interview to know if these girls or their family know any relatively special friends. Who knows, that might be Hero Bandit Dark Emperor!\"\nYou've found the right person...The corners of Klein's mouth almost twitched.\nHe smiled at Mike and said, \"We've already worked together on East Borough's matters. We have sufficient familiarity and trust, so I have no reason to decline.\"\n\"I hope for a pleasant partnership.\" Mike stretched out his hand. \"We'll start tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, and we'll be paid the same as last time for a total of ten pounds.\"\nAt that moment, Dr. Aaron, who had been listening by the side, said, \"Sherlock, I want to hire you as well. This evening, or after dinner.\"\nIt looks like my business is improving recently...Klein asked, amused, \"Will it conflict with Mike's request?\"\n\"No.\" Aaron shook his head. \"My luck recently has been pretty good. This makes me suspect that my bout of bad luck was because of that child's inverted Wheel of Fortune card and the words he said. I'm very troubled and puzzled in this regard. I swear to god that I was very nice to him, and I treated him with the best of intentions. Why would he treat me that way? I wish to visit him at his place and confirm that he didn't do it on purpose. However, I'm ultimately afraid that something similar would happen again or some accident might occur. Therefore, I wish to hire you to protect me. Just for tonight. It won't conflict with Mike's request. How about it?\"\nThat's what I wanted to do! After challenging the impossible and doing good deeds, my moral standing has become pretty good... Am I really going to become the King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck?Klein was pleasantly surprised as he said with a reserved smile, \"No problem, we can talk about the remuneration.\"\n...\nCity of Silver.\nDerrick Berg once again examined the translucent worm with twelve circles, the remains of Amon's avatar.\nHe had originally wanted to ask Mr. Fool what this was exactly, but considering how he had already troubled this godlike figure once, he couldn't bring himself to ask as he abandoned this plan. Now, he planned on showing it at the next Tarot Gathering and ask Mr. Hanged Man, Miss Justice, and the rest.\nAfter hiding the worm, Derrick suddenly thought of something. It was about time for the team that had gone with Shepherd Elder Lovia, to explore the half-destroyed temple of the Fallen Creator, to return-it wasn't too far from the City of Silver, and it was in a direction that they hadn't set foot in before.\nHe decided to take a look. There were quite a few people he knew among the expedition team."}
{"num_chp":172,"summary":"\"How long has the Member of Parliament been dead for?\" Klein asked straightforwardly as he packed up his things.\nIf it was more than fifteen minutes, the information that he could obtain would decline considerably. If it was more than an hour, there would be very little left to find.\nIf it was more than a month, contact with the spirit of the dead would most likely fail.\n\"Regrettably, the initial autopsy report shows that Mr. Maynard died between nine and eleven last night.\" Dunn shook his head and said, \"You only need to provide assistance and not consider if you can be of use.\"\n\"Alright.\" Klein took his coat and walked out of the duty room with his hat and cane in hand. Dunn Smith took his place at the Chanis Gate guardroom.\nTheoretically, as a Beyonder, as long as one's spirituality was enhanced, things like Spirit Vision, divination, and ritualistic magic could be learned. Especially for Beyonders from the Sleepless Sequence who were known for their high spirituality.\nBut in actual fact, the differences between the various sequences was vastly obvious. Dunn Smith and Leonard Mitchell had learned Spirit Vision, but they could only see faint white or light blue in the auras of others. They were unable to precisely differentiate the status of different body parts. Of course, they could definitely see spiritual things with Spirit Vision, but doing so wasn't as effective as using their spiritual perception.\nThat also led to a problem in which Beyonders at the Sleepless, Midnight Poet, and Nightmare Sequences didn't enjoy activating their Spirit Vision.\nSimilarly, if they were willing to, they could also learn spirit pendulums, dowsing, dream divination, and so on. But their rate of success wasn't something worth noting.\nIt was the same situation with ritualistic magic as well.\nWhen the two of them walked past one another, Dunn suddenly said, \"I forgot to tell you that Inspector Tolle is in charge of the case. He's waiting for you at the reception hall in the security company. Remember to change into your new uniform and grab your new documents.\"\nKlein wasn't surprised and replied with a smile, \"New uniform, new documents? The Tingen Police Department sure is efficient.\"\nHe had just advanced to Sequence 8 the day before...\n\"It's because this case is very important, so...\" Dunn spread his hands and took up Klein's previous spot.\nKlein walked upstairs, but he wasn't in a hurry to go to the reception hall. He entered the Nighthawks' break room and entered the attached bathroom to relieve himself. There was only a toilet bowl, a water bottle, and a bucket in the duty room.\nThen, he changed into his police uniform that revealed his promotion to two silver stars and put on his peak cap with the \"two crossed swords and a crown.\"\nAfter transferring his Flaring Sun Charm, Azik's copper whistle, his ritual ingredients, and other items, Klein smoothed out his uniform, took his cane, and exited the break room.\nHe passed through the partition and saw Inspector Tolle seated in the sofa area.\nIt had been a while since they last met. The tall police officer seemed to have gained some weight, and his stomach was even more outstanding. With his thick mustache and hair, he looked like a brown bear that had just escaped from a circus.\n\"I'm glad to work with you again.\" When Tolle saw that it was a Nighthawk that he knew, he let out a breath of relief. He stood up and extended his bear paw.\nNo, palm...Klein corrected himself and shook the other person's hand as a polite gesture.\n\"Me too.\"\nTolle stole a glance at Klein's two shimmering silver stars shoulder strap and said with envy, \"We're at the same rank now, and it hasn't even been a month.\"\nAt first, Klein wanted to reply solemnly that \"The danger that we encounter is ten times worse than yours,\" but he remembered his identity then: Sequence 8 Clown.\nMaybe I can give it a try...Using his spirituality, he looked at the reflection of his facial expression. He lifted the corner of his lips and replied with a smile, \"Maybe in another few months, you'll have to call me \u2018Sir.'\"\n\"You sure are humorous.\" Tolle chuckled and pointed at the door. \"Shall we head out?\"\n\"Alright.\" Klein hadn't given up his cane. Now that he had become a Clown, the cane was truly a viable weapon.\nAfter exiting the Blackthorn Security Company, Klein and Tolle walked down side by side, forming a great contrast due to the skinniness and fatness of the two.\n\"I feel like we could even make an audience at the circus laugh,\" Klein suddenly jested.\nTolle nodded in absolute agreement and said, \"Yes, I feel our vast contrast brings a comedic effect. Do you know that some circuses are trying to use fat and skinny, tall and short clown combinations in their performances?\"\nNo, actually I meant a beast tamer and a brown bear...Klein, of course, wouldn't make such a rude remark. He went along with it and replied, \"It's a pity that there are no fixed circuses in Tingen.\"\n\"That's right, but we have operas, theaters, and music halls,\" Inspector Tolle replied wistfully.\nThey casually chatted until they got onto the police carriage. Then, Klein redirected the topic back to the case.\n\"Is it confirmed that Mr. Maynard was murdered?\"\n\"We can't be certain, but his wife and two sons aren't willing to believe the possibility that he died due to a sudden illness. And there was really something wrong at the scene. When Maynard was found, he was naked on the guestroom's bed,\" Tolle said as he deliberated.\n\"He sleeps separately from his wife?\" Klein leaned back against the carriage wall and mimicked the main character in various detective films.\nTolle shook his head and said, \"No, his wife hasn't been in Tingen recently. She went to Backlund to attend a very important social ball. You might not know, but she's the leader of a new party. She's the daughter of someone from the House of Commons. She's still on her way back to Tingen via steam locomotive. She merely used the telegram to express her opinion on this matter.\"\n\"Maynard is also a member of the new party. He's been a Tingen's Member of Parliament for more than ten years. He intended to run for mayor in next year's election.\"\n\"In other words, his death might be related to this?\" Klein asked casually and immediately laughed. \"I'm sorry, I'm only supposed to be helping with the autopsy. The rest of the matter is not within my area of concern, you don't have to answer.\"\nTolle didn't mind much but sighed.\n\"Autopsy... You're very cautious.\"\n\"As for your guesses, I would only say that there's a possibility. There was a gathering last night at Maynard's place. There were too many guests, and we temporarily can't find any main suspects. Plus, these guests have decent backgrounds, so we have to be very careful. We can't make any mistakes.\"\n\"I understand.\" Klein nodded faintly and asked about the details of the scene.\nMaynard's house was a bungalow located in the Golden Indus borough. It was surrounded by gardens and fields, there was a stable, a fountain, and a broad pathway built from cement.\nKlein put on his peak hat with its police badge and followed behind Inspector Tolle. They passed through the police streamer and entered the double-story house under the gaze of every policeman present.\nIn the living room, there were two male and four female probationary inspectors who were talking to people individually to gather statements.\nKlein looked around and saw many gentlemen in tuxedos and a few ladies in glamorous dresses and checkered gauze hats.\n\"They're the guests who spent the night here,\" Tolle explained and led Klein up the stairs to the second floor directly.\nAlong the way, when the police constables who were searching through the rooms saw the two, they revealed a look of respect without stopping them. Perhaps it was the effect of the inspector epaulets.\n\"This is the guest room where Maynard's corpse was discovered.\" The brawny Tolle stopped by the crimson wooden door.\nKlein thought and asked, \"Which guest was assigned to this guest room?\"\n\"Nobody. There are too many guest rooms in the house, so it wasn't used.\" Tolle put on his white gloves and turned the knob of the crimson wooden door.\nHe made the constable who was keeping watch leave temporarily. Then, he nodded at Klein and said, \"Inspector Moretti, I'll leave the rest to you.\"\n\"May the Goddess bless us, and I hope that we find something.\" Klein put on his white gloves too and locked the door behind him.\nHe walked to the side of the bed and saw that the crimson bedsheets were abnormally messy. The corpse laying on it was covered with a white cloth.\nAt this point, Klein could be considered to be quite experienced. He pulled away the white cloth without fear and looked at Member of Parliament Maynard.\nThe man was in his forties. His blond hair was trimmed short, and his expression was a mixture of pain and happiness.\nKlein took two steps back and took out the ingredients he needed. He quickly finished the setup for the mediumship ritual.\nAs the faint calming fragrance swirled around him, he recited the divination statement that he thought of long ago, \"The cause of Maynard's death.\"\n\"The cause of Maynard's death.\"\n...\nAs he recited the statement, Klein retreated to a nearby high back chair and sat down slowly.\nHis eyes darkened, then he leaned back and quickly fell into a deep sleep.\nIn the illusory and blurry world, he suddenly saw the gentleman from earlier.\nWith his opened blue eyes, Maynard was laying prostrate above a woman with an outstanding body and fair skin. He was thrusting hard against her body.\nHe first displayed an expression of extreme satisfaction and happiness. Then, he suddenly clutched his chest with his right hand. His expression then grew contorted.\nPa!\nAs Maynard fell, the image quickly shattered. Klein opened his eyes and woke up from his dream.\nI can't believe I can actually watch porn in such a manner... So, Maynard had an affair and died of exhaustion?Klein chuckled and massaged his temples.\nHe took out a pen and paper before doing another ritual. He drew a portrait of the lady he had seen in his dream with the aid of the ritual. Of course, everything below her neck was omitted.\nIt was a woman whose age was hard to tell. She had the mature vibe of a woman in her thirties, but there was a remnant of innocence to her. Her eyes were crystal clear, and she had a delicate look.\nKlein looked at his work, then put away his ritual ingredients, and dispelled the spirituality wall.\nHe leaned sideways to grab his silver-edged cane.\nSuddenly, he heard the reverberating sound of someone clearing their throat. He immediately got goosebumps!\nKlein looked towards the bed and saw Maynard gripping the crimson bedsheets so tightly that the tendons on the backs of his hands were protruding out.\nWith a swoosh, the Member of Parliament who died between nine and eleven the previous night suddenly sat up. Saliva drooled from the corners of his lips as he opened his vacant eyes wide."}
{"num_chp":314,"summary":"The Nation of the Evernight, at the peak of the Hornacis mountain range, believed in the Ruler of the Evernight, the Mother of the Sky... Is there some connection between that and the Evernight Demonic Wolf, Flegrea? The illusory ravings I hear are actually \"Hornacis... Flegrea?\"\nWhat is the connection between the ancient god, Evernight Demonic Wolf Flegrea and the Goddess? According to Roselle, Sequence 0 is equivalent to a true god, and each sequence can only have one Sequence 0... The Goddess had inherited the power from the Evernight Demonic Wolf? He wasn't the oldest deity, nor was he the eye of the Creator as he claimed?\nYes, there's a circumstantial clue that doesn't count as proof. The Life School of Thought worships the moon, the crimson moon that evolved from the Creator's eye, but they don't believe in the Evernight Goddess...\nKlein suddenly made several connections as he manipulated The World to speak.\n\"Is there nothing else?\"\n\"No. Matters regarding the King of Demonic Wolves, Flegrea, is also considered a myth in the City of Silver.\" Derrick felt as though he had not given any answers. He suggested out of embarrassment, \"Mr. World, you can change to another question.\"\nChange the question? Little Sun, you're too honest... Then I won't stand on ceremony!Klein made The World say hoarsely, \"Your honesty and trustworthiness leave a deep impression.\n\"I met a Beyonder before. He was able to freely switch between the body and spirit, and they were also able to direct zombies. Do you know which pathway this belongs to, and which Sequence it is?\"\nAlthough it was impossible for The Sun, who was located in the Forsaken Land of the Gods and the City of Silver, to form a connection with the capital of the Loen Kingdom, Backlund, Klein was cautious enough to change the pronoun referring to Miss Sharron from \"she\" to \"he.\"\n\"By the way, he's not a High-Sequence Beyonder,\" The World added in a deep voice.\nDerrick recalled the education he had received seriously before saying, \"If he's not a High-Sequence Beyonder, then the Phoenix pathway can be eliminated.\"\n\"The Phoenix pathway?\" Klein deliberately made The World show a certain level of surprise.\nAfter attending so many gatherings, Derrick was very clear that there was a discrepancy between the terms used by the City of Silver and Miss Justice and company. Therefore, Derrick explained without finding it strange, \"It's the Beyonder pathway that governs death and partly controls the spirit world.\n\"Its Sequence 9 is Corpse Collector.\"\nSo it's the Death pathway... From the looks of it, Phoenix ancestor, Gregrace, was Death during the ancient times...Klein sat at the end of the long bronze table in a composed manner. He controlled World as he nodded.\n\"I understand. You can continue.\"\nDerrick replied immediately, \"I can only think of two possibilities. One is a type of special Devil. Just like I previously said, the Devils that evolve from different species can have their differences. There is a type that can freely switch between body and spirit, but they're rather rare. And they might not be able to direct zombies.\"\n\"Can they be humans?\" The World asked.\n\"No, not that I know of any similar examples,\" Derrick said honestly.\n\"What about the second possibility?\" Klein thought back to Miss Sharron's usual performance in battle, and The World changed his sitting position.\nDerrick replied seriously, \"Mutants.\"\n\"Mutants? Isn't that referring to monsters?\" The World asked hoarsely.\nKlein clearly remembered that Mr. Azik had mentioned that the term \"Mutant\" was the general term for humans that were put under a curse. Due to the different curses, Mutants transformed into different races.\nThey were usually the same as humans, but their hearts were always filled with a suppressed, twisted desire in their hearts. Their desires erupted when they came into contact with a certain scene or object, turning into monsters. They would then succumb to their desires for blood and bloodshed.\nEvery time they unleashed their desires, they would become slightly more merciless and apathetic. Finally, they would lose all their positive feelings that are expected of a human.\nThe most common Mutant was the Werewolf.\nDerrick nodded frankly and said, \"That's right. Mutants are the various kinds of monsters that evolve from humans due to the negative effects of certain Beyonder characteristics.\"\nIt's not a curse, but the negative impact of some Beyonder characteristic? Sitting upright in the thick gray fog, Klein found this to be different from what Mr. Azik had described.\nIs this the understanding of Mutants from before the Cataclysm? General knowledge in the City of Silver is quite precious to the Beyonders of the Northern and Southern continents...Klein became increasingly aware of the special nature of the Forsaken Land of the Gods.\nAt this moment, Derrick continued, \"The characteristics which Mutants possess happen to form a Beyonder pathway. Therefore, ordinary people can turn into Mutants by consuming potions as well.\"\n\"A Mutant pathway? Which pathway is this referring to? What is the name of the corresponding Sequence 9?\" Klein asked curiously through The World.\nDerrick ignored the first few questions, treating them as a necessary supplement.\n\"In the City of Silver, the corresponding Sequence 9 is called Prisoner.\n\"The mind is the prisoner of the body, and the body is the prisoner of the world. This refers to the madness that is restrained and the desire that is oppressed.\"\nPrisoner? This pathway is held by the Rose School of Thought. They're famous for their bloody sacrifices, and worship of the so-called Chained God... Miss Sharron doesn't look like such a cold-blooded, indiscriminate person... Wait a minute, Maric was apparently being pursued by some faction. Were he and Miss Sharron traitors of the Rose School of Thought? Their betrayal was because they didn't want to turn into crazy heretics?Klein speculated as he made The World say, \"I'm very satisfied with your answer. Transaction complete.\"\nFollowing that, a few members shared their experiences and news.\nAs for Klein, he ended the Tarot Gathering just before his spirituality was exhausted.\nWhen the area above the gray fog returned to its peaceful state, even the fake World was gone. He then started to travel back and forth between the real world and the mysterious space, bringing the Master Key to the ancient palace.\nAlthough I deduced from Roselle's diary that there is a high probability that there isn't a Sequence 0 for the Apprentice pathway, I can't be rash. If there is a Sequence 1 or 2, they might be able to counterattack effectively across space... And what if there really is a Sequence 0? I shouldn't gamble with my life...After Klein recovered, he wrote a divination statement: \"Its origin.\"\nNext, he held the Master Key in his hand so as not to misdirect the moniker \"it.\"\nLeaning back in his chair, Klein chanted the divination statement and gradually fell asleep.\nIn the gray haze of the shattered world, he saw a bronze lamp rack with many flickering candles.\nAround the lamp rack was what seemed to be a secret room, devoid of any external light. There were long tables, black iron pots, glass jars, brown colored notebooks, and other items.\nA young man wearing a classic black robe stood in front of the long table, staring at the potion in his hand.\n\"Ancestors, I am about to embark on the path of extraordinariness. I will definitely reproduce the illustrious glory of the Abraham family!\" he mumbled to himself and drank the potion.\nThe muscles on his face contorted in pain.\nSuddenly, he cried out miserably and fell to the ground. He squirmed continuously, strangling himself.\nAfter a few seconds, he tore off his clothes, stripped off his skin, and turned into a monster covered in blood.\nBoom!\nHis flesh exploded, and each piece of flesh seemed to possess a life of its own as they continued to crawl in every direction, leaving behind signs of corrosion.\nIn the end, they were unable to leave the secret chamber and gradually calmed down.\nThe specks of light gathered together and combined together with a broken finger, forming an ancient and simple-looking brass-colored key.\nAt the same time, Klein saw a silver pocket watch inlaid with diamonds among the tattered clothes.\nAfter the dream ended, he opened his eyes and looked forward. He said with a sigh, \"Seriously, he said he wanted to restore the glory of the Abraham family, but he failed at the first step... It's risky even at Sequence 9...\"\nThe Abraham family was a powerful aristocratic family of the Tudor Dynasty during the Fourth Epoch. It was said that they held the Beyonder pathway of Apprentice, but it was very likely that it was incomplete.\nKlein recalled the scene he had just seen. He tapped his fingers on the edge of the table and muttered to himself, \"He spoke in the Loen language. I can't tell where his accent is from.\n\"It was during the last ten years since it became popular to embed pure diamonds into pocket watches.\n\"Perhaps I should visit the Harvest Church when I have the time and ask Father Utravsky where he got his Master Key from... Perhaps I can find some clues.\"\nJust as Klein was about to leave the fog, the illusory star that symbolized The Magician began to swell and contract. Fors was requesting a sacrificial ritual.\nFors usually wouldn't have carried so much cash on her, but she had been planning to attend a Beyonder gathering, so she had left 500 pounds to see if she could buy what she wanted. Who knew that the corresponding gathering had been canceled because of the circumstances. Now, she could use it to pay for the Apothecary formula and the \"acting method'-a total of 430 pounds.\nSeeing the screen of light appear and seeing the paper money disappear, it took Fors a few seconds to react. She sincerely thanked Mr. Fool.\nI shall sell the Apothecary formula to Viscount Glaint for 300 pounds. I can't be too greedy, or else this will ruin our long-term partnership... As for Miss Audrey, I'll ignore her for the time being. She has hopes of coming into contact with the Psychology Alchemists and obtaining the corresponding formula directly. If there's really no hope with that, I'll try purchasing it from the Tarot Gathering... Sigh... I have to see if the \"acting method\" is effective. If it is, then I have to consider how to pray to Mr. Fool. Oh... Xio is such a fool. She has always been acting as an Arbiter and had unknowingly fulfilled the requirements of the \"acting method\"...Fors began thinking of the future.\nWhen he received the 430 pounds, Klein also received a prayer from Miss Justice. She said that if Mr. Fool's adorer no longer needed cash, she could promise to exchange the 200 pounds for Roselle's diary entries to make sure that Mr. Fool was satisfied.\nI'm satisfied. I'm only a few dozen pounds short of a thousand pounds!Klein declined Miss Justice's offer.\nThen, he busily helped The Sun \"awaken\" his memories regarding the seven gods.\nAfter doing all this, Klein returned to the real world in exhaustion. He drew the curtains open and started going through the dossier with the information regarding the serial murders, searching for the animal that might have existed."}
{"num_chp":559,"summary":"With that idea in mind, Klein immediately began making preparations.\nIt was to explore the spirit world and select a suitable target to become a messenger. After he left the Rorsted Archipelago and its surrounding sea, he could bring the Sea God Scepter along with him to reason with the target and convince them to become his messenger.\nOnce I find myself lost or in a dangerous situation, I would immediately halt the summoning and return above the gray fog. There's basically no risk...Klein thought for a few seconds, then he locked the door and began the ritual of summoning himself.\nAt the end of the ritual, he quickly arrived above the gray fog, but he was in no hurry to respond to himself. Instead, he sat down and let the Sea God Scepter fly out from the junk pile and land on his palm.\nHe intended to scan the prayers of the believers as per routine for anything to respond to.\nDuring this process, Klein discovered that some of the prayers were actually quite interesting, because humans could deceive friends and relatives, but it was difficult to keep their truest thoughts when confessing or praying to the gods. At most, they would modify the truth to make them look less bad.\nA mixed-blood, who had clearly changed his faith to the Lord of Storms, had already reached the middle ranks of the Bayam police department, but in his confession, he tried hard to portray his behavior as a plan of burdening himself to carry out a mission. For the sake of a brighter future for his kinsmen, he could only confess to god in misery, hoping that \"He\" would protect him, so that he could climb up the ranks in the police system as a believer of the Lord of Storms.\nAlthough his words sounded flawless, the fluctuations in his thoughts and emotions during his confession were clearly displayed in the prayer scene. It was something that couldn't be hidden.\nTrying to deceive God while you are deceiving yourself... If it were a gigantic sea serpent like Kalvetua who lacked intelligence, it might've believed you... Should I give him a lightning bolt or ten wind blades? Yes, it's pretty impressive to have a mixed-blood rise up to the ranks of senior inspector. I'll keep him. There are benefits to having a snitch...Klein raised his Sea God Staff, making one of the blue gems glow.\nThe light poured into the scene and imperceptibly seeped into the senior inspector named Boulaya.\nThis wasn't a curse, nor was it a cue. It was a mark of divinity that almost no one could discover.\nSimply put, it's a unilateral way for me to \"keep tabs\" on you...Klein silently added inwardly.\nHe continued browsing and saw a young believer with slightly curly bronze hair praying for a man named Zangmo to be caught in a storm and buried at sea. He claimed that Zangmo wasn't pious enough, but the truth was that, as a competing fisherman, Zangmo was always able to harvest more fish than he did.\nWhat kind of nonsense prayers are these? The human heart sure is hard to fathom...Klein frowned and mumbled to himself. Then he had a vague idea.\nFor a Faceless to engage in real acting, it not only requires a flawless performance in terms of external appearances and habitual actions, but it also needs to maintain the core personality. Not many changes are allowed. As for personality, every person is different, so there must be a difference to a certain degree...\nBy browsing the prayers of my believers, it's equivalent to me realizing different kinds of personalities and mental states without going through the trouble. When talking about the many masks we wear, it's not only about looks...\nThis will be rather important for my subsequent acting as a Faceless. It can save me time from figuring things out through accumulated experiences.\nKlein increasingly felt that acting as Sea God was very beneficial towards him.\nWhen you are acting the role of a demigod, even if you don't get any feedback, you will still definitely get some considerable benefits... This is a way of gaining experience of being someone of a higher level...Klein perked up, no longer being perfunctory about skimming through the prayer scenes.\nAfter quickly browsing through one scene after another, his gaze stopped at a merchant named Ralph.\nThe businessman praised the miracle of the reappearance of the sea god, and he had indicated that he planned to offer a third of his fortune-worth 20,000 pounds-to the Resistance, half for military expenses, and half for the reconstruction of God's statue.\nActually, there's no need to go through all that trouble. Just directly offer it to me...Klein muttered half-jokingly.\nHe thought for a moment, and then he conjured a background of waves and storms with heavy rain and lightning falling together. He responded in a low voice, \"You have honored my name by helping your compatriots and companions.\n\"The young lambs need help, food, and education.\"\nHe intended to get Ralph to set up a charity fund with the 20,000 pounds, and to seek donations widely from the community to make up for the damage, create a consensus; and help to provide local children with food, clothing, and education under the pretext of governance.\nAs for the military expenditures of the Resistance, Klein understood that in a world with Beyonder powers, it was very difficult to rely solely on the opposition from the natives of the colony to succeed. Therefore, they needed the help of foreign countries like Feysac and Intis.\nFunding was undoubtedly needed.\nUnfortunately, it's not possible to add a line in the Ten Commandments about \"boldly and confidently seek funding\"; that would damage the image of Sea God... The Resistance shouldn't be thinking about annihilating the garrison troops. They should just focus on destroying the transportation infrastructure and make it more difficult for the governor-general's office to rule, so as to initiate talks...As a keyboard warrior, Klein wasn't lacking in ideas in such areas.\nHe quickly restrained his wandering thoughts and made a divination to see if it was dangerous exploring the spirit world today.\nAfter obtaining the revelation that it wasn't considered dangerous, Klein took the Dark Emperor card, naturally changed his image, and stepped into the Door of Summoning.\nAfter entering the real world, he stuffed the mystical items he needed into his body as a precaution. Then, like last time, he used Cogitation to sense the spirit world.\nTaking a step forward, he passed through an invisible curtain as Klein's illusory figure floated up.\nAround him, red, yellow, blue, green, and other colors were superimposed, like they were like the most abstract oil painting ever. The concept of direction that humans were used to could no longer be used here. If one used the old means of distinguishing direction and one's location, they would definitely find themselves lost.\nKlein roamed carefully and casually, sometimes seeing a yellow sun like a child's sketch, sometimes brushing past an incorporeal river that flowed quietly.\nThere was also a flat women with her upper body naked and a face resembling a smiling moon, a canoe with its end upturned, a tangled ball of thread, and a serpentine staircase leading to the seven pure lights.\nIn this extremely chaotic world, other than spirit world creatures, all kinds of information existed as abstract symbols. Thus, what one received from a divination process would only be a revelation that required one to interpret it on their own.\nAs for those symbols, there was a chance that they would come to life and become incorporeal monsters.\nThis was the spirit world that couldn't be understood and viewed with common human knowledge.\nThe last time he came in, he had easily discovered spirit world creatures, and he had noticed the creepy gazes from unknown locations that made his hair stand on end. There was the headless woman who carried four heads, a round eye with clear blacks and whites, and a giant jellyfish with a skull attached to each tentacle. He had easily encountered all of them back then.\nBut this time, he failed to see a single spirit world creature despite roaming for so long. Even the indescribable figures in the distance had disappeared, as if they had hidden themselves.\nIt can't be that you're afraid of being my messenger, can it? Yes, I entered the spirit world in the form of a Soul Body. Perhaps the thoughts in my mind will appear in a special, formless manner here, turning into hidden symbols that interact with the spirit world. This then naturally affects my path options?Klein was puzzled, but he couldn't find the reason.\nAll sorts of thoughts flashed through his mind when his body suddenly sank down and he fell freely.\nAfter a while, Klein could only see the vivid superposition of the colors and the various symbols that took physical form.\nWhat's going on?He began to consider whether he should write to Mr. Azik and ask him about it, or to throw the radio transceiver above the gray fog and get it tainted with the aura, so that he could contact the magic mirror, Arrodes.\nWhile floating, Klein's heart suddenly palpitated as he quickly dodged to the side.\nA tinge of yellow and green flashed across his eyes as a giant foot that was large enough to squash his entire body landed, stepping into the interlaced red and blue color spots.\nAbove the sole of the foot was a long, festering leg covered in a yellowish green liquid. The leg was over three meters long, and above it was a huge body that was wrapped in corpse oil bandages.\nAmidst the solidified aura in the area, the two legs that were filled with yellow-green pus alternated as they rose up. Carrying a body that was difficult to discern, the legs quickly disappeared into the depths of the spirit world.\nKlein stood at a distance, not daring to make a sound.\nFinally, he confirmed that he was fine as he grimaced and thought,The spirit world is really scary. You can accidentally encounter a powerhouse just passing by... A powerhouse among the spirit world creatures?\nKlein shook his head and continued his search.\nAt that moment, he had no idea where in the spirit world he had wandered to.\nAfter drifting for a while, he finally found some traces of spirit world creatures.\nJust as he was about to switch from flying forward to descending to his left, he was surprised to find that his body continued to move forward uncontrollably at an accelerating speed.\nIn front of him, the chaotic superimposed colors and the grayish-white mist that filled the area suddenly split open, and a large, purely black three-masted sailboat leaped in.\nThe boat was nearly a hundred meters long, and three pitch-black sails were hanging high up like flags.\nOn the left and right sides of the ship, there were cannon muzzles and all kinds of sailors were running around on the deck.\nAll of this was so real, so substantial, and so out of place when it came to the spirit world as a whole.\nHowever, as the ship entered the spirit world, its black color quickly turned richer, tainting itself with an ethereal vibe.\nOn its deck stood a mottled stone chair that was two to three meters high; its back facing the cabin. Leaning against the chair's back, a colossal figure that was comparable to an ancient giant sat there.\nHe had a black beard that went just past his neck, and he wore a tall, pointed crown on his head. He wore a gorgeous black robe with silver fringes. The wrinkles on his face looked hardened and filled with magnificence. It made one subconsciously wish to bow their heads.\nUnder the slightly wrinkled forehead and on the high nose bridge, Klein's pitch-black full-body armor and black crown were reflected into those two dark red eyes.\nAs for Klein, he was having trouble stopping his slow flight toward the giant.\nTheir gazes met among the layers of colors and symbols in the spirit world, and then Klein disappeared.\nThe giant on the mottled stone chair didn't withdraw his gaze as he continued staring over in a long silence."}
{"num_chp":70,"summary":"Clip-clop, clip-clop.\nThe horses widened their paces as the wheels began rolling in tow. Despite activating his Spirit Vision and turning around, hoping to observe the refined and sweet lady, Klein did not have his wishes fulfilled. All his eyes reflected were brown figures moving past him.\nMeanwhile, the passengers from the stop had already boarded the carriage. The carriage door was closed tightly as it gradually departed.\nWithin the carriage, twenty to thirty people stood closely to each other, their energy fields overlapping and shielding each other. Hence, it was an explosion of colors in Klein's vision, making it difficult for him to differentiate.\nHe shook his head quietly and raised his finger to tap his glabella to deactivate his Spirit Vision.\nTo him, it was simply help he could provide if he happened to chance upon it. However, if he were to miss it, and the situation was not especially clear, there was no point taking it to heart and delaying his own matters.\nWhile bathing in the crimson moonlight, Klein strolled back home on the still bustling Daffodil Street. He returned to see Melissa sitting beside the dining table. She was busy doing her homework under a bright gas lamp.\nShe bit at the fountain pen and frowned, appearing deep in thought.\n\"Where's Benson?\" Klein asked casually.\n\"Ah...\" Melissa looked up. She blanked out for a few seconds before saying, \"He said he went around a few boroughs today and was covered in sweat. He's taking a nice relaxing bath.\"\n\"Alright.\" Klein chuckled. Suddenly, he realized that she was wearing a dress he had never seen before.\nIt was entirely beige in color. It had fashionable engageantes. The collar and edges of her top had thin frills. Apart from that, it was a rather simple design, the type one wore as daily casual clothing. It fully accentuated the youth of a sixteen or seventeen-year-old.\n\"New dress?\" Klein asked with a smile.\nIt was a purchase that he and Benson had insisted upon.\nMelissa answered in the affirmative tersely.\n\"I just took it back from Mrs. Rochelle. I was thinking that since I had to wash it later, I might as well try it on first.\"\nKlein was rather puzzled when he heard that.\n\"Mrs. Rochelle?\"\nWasn't she our former neighbor?\nMelissa nodded and explained in all seriousness, \"Mrs. Rochelle is actually a seamstress, but she was quite unlucky. She had no choice but to sew and mend clothes for others at home. She leads a pretty tough life. I knew that she had pretty good skill and the price she quoted is cheaper than at a women's clothing store. Furthermore, it's very well-tailored to my figure, so I ordered a new skirt from her. It only cost nine soli and five pence and took only a few days. A dress of a similar style would cost three halves of a pound at Harrods Department Store!\"\nWhat a frugal girl... Sis, I know that at least half the reason is due to your pity of Mrs. Rochelle...Klein did not reproach Melissa for deciding things for herself. Instead, he said with a smile, \"When did you go to Harrods?\"\nThat was at Howes Street, near the Divination Club. It was somewhere where the middle-class shopped.\n\"...\" Melissa was momentarily at a loss for words. It took her a long while before she said, \"It was Selena and Elizabeth. They insisted I accompany them. Actually, well-I actually prefer gears more. I like places with steam and machinery. Yeah.\"\n\"It's quite, well-nice for a girl to occasionally shop at a department store.\" Klein laughed as he comforted his sister.\nAfter some idle talk, he briskly walked to the second floor, hoping to wash away the repulsive mixed smells from the bar.\nJust as he was about to return to his bedroom to get a change of clothes, he suddenly heard sounds coming from the bathroom close to the balcony.\nA few seconds later, Benson stepped out while drying his gradually receding hairline.\n\"How was it? Did you compliment Melissa's new dress?\" He shot a glance at Klein and asked with a smile.\n\"I guess I forgot. All I did was ask where it was done...\" Klein thought for a moment as he said.\nBenson immediately chortled and shook his head.\n\"How unbecoming of an elder brother. When Melissa received the dress, she couldn't bear putting it down. After rushing to cook and wash the dishes, she immediately wore the dress and has refused to take it off ever since.\"\n...Wasn't she planning on changing after showering? She can wash and starch the clothes while doing so...Klein subconsciously refuted with the explanation that Melissa had given.\n\"Tsk.\" Benson sighed. \"It's been scorching the past few days. She was busy in the kitchen for a long time, so I believe she would feel much better doing her homework after a shower.\"\nThat's right...Klein was suddenly enlightened as he gave his brother a knowing smile.\nSo that's what kind of person you are, Melissa... There's nothing wrong with a girl caring for her appearance. There's no need to find excuses...The corners of his mouth curved up as he shook his head gently before walking into his bedroom.\nWhile he was showering, Klein faintly heard knocking downstairs. He immediately wondered.\nDoesn't the worker who's in charge of collecting coins for the gas meter come only once every two weeks?\nCould it be Mrs. Shaud from next door? That can't be. It's said that this lady strictly abides by the etiquette of middle-class society. She would not visit at an inappropriate time.\nIn his puzzlement, Klein wiped dry his body. Wearing old but comfortable shirt and trousers, he came down the stairs.\nHe surveyed the area but did not notice any strangers. He asked, \"Was someone at the door just now?\"\nBenson, who was reading the newspapers casually, said with a smile, \"It was Bitsch Mountbatten, one of the policemen in charge of Iron Cross Street. He asked if we met an eighteen or nineteen-year-old boy who has a rotund face. Heh, he even gave us a sketch to identify. Unfortunately, neither one of us have seen him, or we would have received a reward. What about you?\"\n\"Nope.\" Klein had a general idea what was happening.\nInstigator Tris had successfully escaped the Evil Dragon Bar at the harbor. He had escaped somewhere close to Iron Cross Street and Daffodil Street; therefore, the police were making visits from door to door.\nAnd to go this far made it clear that the operation of nabbing the Instigator had completely failed!\nKlein did not bother himself with the situation. He had yet to begin combat training. He only had basic mastery of shooting, so to consider dealing with a natural \u2018Assassin' was simply using his life as a joke.\nHe did not sleep well that night. He kept worrying that the Instigator would infiltrate their house to hide, causing another massacre.\nThankfully, Daffodil Street was quiet the entire night, with the morning sun rays dispersing all the fog.\nThe relaxed Klein changed into formal attire, wore his top hat, held his cane, and went all the way to Zouteland Street. He greeted Rozanne at the reception hall.\n\"Good morning, Klein,\" replied Rozanne happily. She suppressed her voice and said, \"I heard the huge operation last night failed?\"\n\"The operation to nab Instigator Tris?\" Klein asked in curiosity.\n\"Yeah!\" Rozanne nodded heavily. She shot a glance at the partition and said, \"Apparently an informant of the Mandated Punishers discovered the Instigator at the harbor... They were planning on waiting for additional Beyonders and another Special Operations squad from the police to arrive before beginning the operation to do the deed instantly without alarming the commoners. Unfortunately, that Instigator was extremely sharp. He charged out of the encirclement when he noticed something amiss, successfully escaping as a result.\"\n\"At such times, they need a Beyonder with tracking abilities, such as me.\" Klein made a joke.\n\"There was no lack of trackers back then.\" Dunn Smith's voice suddenly sounded.\nRozanne turned her head abruptly and saw the captain wearing his black windbreaker. He was glaring right at her with his deep pair of gray eyes while leaning against the partition's frame.\nShe hurriedly raised her hands to cover her mouth. Then, she shook her head incessantly, expressing her futile innocence.\nDunn turned his gaze to Klein and after some thought, he said, \"There were a total of six Beyonders from the Mandated Punishers, the Machinery Hivemind, and us Nighthawks. We traced the injured Tris to Iron Cross Street's Lower Street. We found his temporary residence, but the clues ended there. Be it Beyonder methods or ordinary investigations, nothing worked. It was as though he evaporated into thin air, disappearing completely.\"\n\"Do you need my help with divination?\" Klein asked probingly.\nDunn shook his head gently.\n\"The Machinery Hivemind had a Machinery Hivemind. He is a senior Beyonder as good as Old Neil. I even suspect that he's already at Sequence 8. I'm just unaware what the name of the corresponding potion is.\"\n\"The Theosophy Order's heritage to this day must have something special about it,\" consoled Klein.\nFor the rest of the morning, he continued his mysticism curriculum, read the historical information and documents, and practiced various techniques just like always.\nWith lunchtime almost approaching, Klein's mind began to wander.\nAnother few minutes later, he put away the documents, having heard the summoning of his stomach.\nAt that moment, Dunn Smith came into the clerk office. He said in a deep but mild manner, \"Klein, follow me to Chanis Gate. Sealed Artifact 2-049 has arrived. The subsequent operation might require your sensing of that notebook.\"\n\"...Alright,\" Klein got up and replied.\nHis thoughts became scrambled. He imagined how the sealed item would look or if the operation would be dangerous.\nWhile in this rather tense silence, he followed Dunn down the stairs and into the tunnel.\nAfter going straight at the intersection, Dunn suddenly stopped and turned his head, saying sternly, \"Do this action together with me. Keep doing it and absolutely do not stop. Remember, absolutely do not stop. This is for your own safety!\"\nWhile speaking, Dunn bent his arm followed by extending it. He repeated this action without stopping.\nKlein looked at the captain demonstrate in a befuddled manner. Suddenly enlightened, he asked, \"Has this got to do with the uniqueness of the Sealed Artifact?\"\n\"Yes.\" Dunn nodded with abnormal seriousness. \"Repeating such an action will allow us to discover if anything happens to you immediately. Saving you in time will not result in any life-threatening dangers.\"\n\"Okay.\" Klein did not hesitate further as he began the repeated action of bending and extending his arm.\n\"If your arm is sore, use the other one,\" added Dunn.\nSealed Artifact \"2-049\" sure is odd... What meaning does this action have? It seems very dangerous...These thoughts flashed past Klein's mind as he looked solemnly at the captain.\n\"Alright.\"\nHe had too many questions on his mind, but since Chanis Gate was in sight, he had no choice but to bear with it.\nBesides, with my security clearance, I'll probably not learn of the details. I can only do as I'm ordered...Klein exhaled as he followed Captain Dunn to the Keeper room outside Chanis Gate."}
{"num_chp":281,"summary":"In the suburbs west of North Borough, in a soon-to-be-abandoned three-story house.\nIt originally belonged to the Backlund Medical School, but the latter's main campus had now moved to a better and more suitable location, leaving behind only a small number of teaching staff and students who were left \"guarding\" the area after failing to graduate.\nAudrey was wearing a white gown and white mask. Her smooth blonde hair was also coiled up and stuffed under a cool-colored surgical cap.\nShe darted her eyes to the side and looked at Fors Wall who was dressed in the same way. She always felt that Fors had a special temperament that seemed to make her more suited to such attires than herself.\nEh... It's the kind of temperament that allows her to pick up a scalpel and cut open a patient's stomach at any moment...Audrey didn't say anything. She followed half a step behind Fors as they entered the classroom in front of them.\nShe was startled by the information she had received from Fors because Mr. Fool had said it was a simple task.\nConsidering that the simplicity of said task might be from Mr. Fool's point of view, Audrey took advantage of the moment when she was alone, changing into a disguise, to recite his honorable name and silently pray, so as to report everything that had exactly happened.\nHowever, she had yet to receive a response.\nAfter passing through the door and entering a room, Audrey instinctively looked around and found that this wasn't an ordinary classroom. There were actually four skeletal specimens and four coffins made of glass. The coffins were filled with pale naked corpses that were soaked in preserving agents.\nAt the very top of the classroom, there was a transparent glass pillar that was also filled with a liquid. Floating inside was a male corpse that wore a black scholarly robe.\nThe corpse's clothes stuck tightly to its body, giving off an extremely heavy feeling. He didn't relax and simply floated upright in the middle.\nIt's as if he had died by drowning instead of being placed in there after his death...Audrey made a preliminary judgment based on her attitude as a Spectator.\nIn addition, she saw a number of men in white coats, white masks, and surgical caps sitting around the long tables in the room. None of them said a word, just like the bodies and bones around them.\nLooking out at the crimson moon which had finally peeked out of the gloomy darkness, Audrey turned her head back to look at the scene inside the classroom. For a moment, she couldn't help but shudder as this place instilled an instinctive fear.\nBut at the same time, she felt excited and agitated.\nThis is what the life of a Beyonder should be...Audrey silently muttered to herself as she followed Fors to a corner before sitting down.\nAfter waiting for a while, the floating black-clothed male corpse inside the upright glass pillar at the front of the classroom suddenly opened his eyes. His voice transmitted through the layers of obstructions.\n\"Let's begin.\"\n...\nEast Borough, Dharavi Street.\nIn his dusty grayish-blue worker uniform and cap, he walked along the dark streets that only had a few gas lamps that were still working.\nThere was candlelight shining down from the various apartments on both sides of the street. This was combined with the crimson moonlight that passed through the clouds with great difficulty, and they barely outlined the silhouettes of the pedestrians.\nKlein encountered people with old, tattered clothes, their faces numb with despair. They were the homeless who had been chased away by the police.\nThey had no place to sleep, so they wandered aimlessly through the streets. Occasionally, they would find some inconspicuous corner or park bench to rest at for a while, but they were soon chased away again.\nIn the cold and dark night, Klein felt that they were more like zombies than the zombies he had seen, and the entire East Borough was more like an abyss than the legendary abyss.\nHe hurriedly took a quick breath which hurt his throat, causing him to cough involuntarily. He quickly gathered his thoughts and looked through the corner of his eyes at the apartment on the corner of the street. It had obviously suffered from an explosion and hadn't been repaired yet.\nThe best place to monitor the crime scene is the apartment across the street. The third and fourth story and the roof all meet these requirements...Klein analyzed the situation with the knowledge he had learned as a Nighthawk.\nThroughout the whole process, he didn't slow down his pace to avoid arousing suspicion.\nAt the end of the street, Klein smoothly crossed the apartment building numbered 1 and entered the building across the street from the crime scene.\nThe one-bedroom apartment he had rented in East Borough was similar to this apartment, and he had also lived in an apartment of slightly higher class with his brother Benson and sister Melissa in Tingen City for quite a long time. It was Klein's personal experience, but it also came from the memory fragments of the original Klein.\nAs his thoughts raced, Klein lowered his cap, lowered his head, and without rushing, he walked up the creaking stairs to the third floor.\nDue to his unlucky encounter in the evening, he no longer had a revolver, so all he could do was stick one hand into his pocket and hold a few tarot cards in between his fingers.\nThere was no light other than the faint moonlight in the corridor of the third floor. Klein was in no hurry to move forward, so he carefully observed the layout.\nThe spot directly across the crime scene is on the left. The one with the best view for surveillance should be the third room from here...Klein began to walk slowly and carefully.\nAfter walking past two rooms, he also inserted his right hand into his pocket and gently opened the iron cigarette case.\nAfter a split-second, his fingers touched the All-Black Eye, and the murmurs resounded in his ears as they attempted to tear his mind apart.\nAt the same time, with the help of this corrupted item, Klein saw many strange black lines.\nThese thin lines floated in the air, and although they were intertwined and entangled a little, he could still distinguish who they belonged to if he traced them back to the source.\nThe corresponding figures were reflected in Klein's soon-to-be-cooked brain. There were men, women, and children sleeping in the bunk beds, and several tenants lying in bed on the floor.\nOther than that, there were no other special spots, nor were there any hidden figures.\nThe illusion in front of him and the auditory hallucination in his ears slowly improved as Klein quickly retracted his hand from the All-Black Eye.\nHe endured the pain as he continued to move forward. Once he felt some relief, he would immediately observe the other room.\nUnfortunately, his efforts of \"searching\" the entire apartment to see if there were any places that allowed the observation of the crime scene was in vain.\nPhew. Phew...Klein cowered in a corner of a balcony, his hands were on his knees as he panted heavily.\nTears streamed from the corners of his eyes, and from time to time, his nose would run as if he had fallen sick.\nThis was the result of his repeated contact with the All-Black Eye within a short period of time. Even with Klein's resistance in this area, he wasn't completely immune to it.\nThe only thing that satisfied him was that it only agitated him and didn't corrupt him. Otherwise, he would've given up long ago and wouldn't have dared to try again. That would've led directly to devolving into madness.\nAfter resting for a while, Klein finally calmed down and switched to a different apartment that didn't have the same view as this one, but it was still for naught.\nDid I interpret it wrong? The clues are at the scene of the crime?When Klein returned to the street, he looked suspiciously out of the corner of his eye at the apartment with traces of an explosion.\nWith the mindset of just giving it a try, he put his hand back into his pocket, pushed the metal cigarette case open, and stuck his hand inside.\nHe wanted to see if anyone was hiding in the apartment where the crime scene was located.\nWith a hum, Klein's head suddenly felt like it was being smashed as his body wobbled a little.\nLike a drunkard, he staggered forward and looked at the apartment which had signs of an explosion.\nAs he was too far away, he couldn't \"clearly see\" the black lines, nor could he trace the source of the black lines. He could only barely distinguish where the black lines had gathered, and this indicated that there was someone present.\nNo, no, no...Klein quickly swept the area and made a rough judgment.\nSuddenly, he noticed a black line floating out from the crime scene on the third floor which merged into the air!\nThis...Klein's pupils shrank, and he made a confirmation before quickly withdrawing his hands so as to stop being in contact with the All-Black Eye.\nThere's someone in the destroyed room!\nThat murderer is actually crazy enough to wait for investigators to come to the crime scene?\nIsn't he afraid that official Beyonders will take over the case?\nI made a wrong judgment and failed to find him because I shared a different sense of logic from that of a lunatic...\nMany thoughts flashed through Klein's mind as he slowly exhaled and pretended that nothing had happened whilst he walked in a circle until he reached the entrance of the apartment building.\nBy then, all the negative effects he had suffered from the All-Black Eye had been quelled.\nControlling his facial expression and body language, Klein headed up to the third floor as if he were going home, his footsteps quick and heavy with fatigue.\nIn the darkness of the corridor, he caught sight of the doorless room which had half its walls collapsed. Then, he \"casually\" headed for the public bathroom.\nAs he neared the room, his hand, which had been in his pocket, touched the All-Black Eye.\nAgain, the mind-wrecking murmurs and the blurred hallucinations assaulted him. Through the corners of his eyes, Klein saw a black, illusory thread spread out from the crime scene.\nAs he traced the source, he found a man who had completely merged into the shadows. His aura was the same color.\nThe man was extremely tall, almost two meters in height. The corners of his mouth drooped slightly, making him appear rather eccentric.\nHis cold eyes were like those of a wild beast's, possessing a ferocity that couldn't be hidden.\nIt's not Lanevus...Klein withdrew his fingers, relaxed his body, and avoided the likelihood of staring. He entered the public bathroom at the end of the corridor without stopping. Nor did he alarm the man.\nThe public bathroom and the crime scene weren't on the same side. He wiped off his cold sweat, and after quelling the negative effects, he directly jumped out the window, climbing down skillfully before leaving with brisk steps. He didn't stay a moment longer.\nHe knew that in a few minutes the man would be alerted to the absence of someone who had gone to the bathroom, so he had to get as far away from the street as possible.\nIt wasn't that Klein didn't want to walk back the way he came from, but if he didn't know which room he could go to, it would similarly expose him.\nThe Clown quickly ran and circled around a huge area before entering that one-bedroom apartment he had rented in East Borough. He then went above the gray fog to confirm that there was no danger of him being caught.\nThat fellow must have had some sort of deep connection with Lanevus...After a moment's thought, Klein conjured a portrait of the man from earlier, sending his thoughts to the crimson star that represented Miss Justice.\nSoon after, he said solemnly in a tone of authority, \"This is a clue.\""}
{"num_chp":463,"summary":"A miracle is to be resurrected from the dead?\nKlein suddenly remembered what had happened to him!\nThe head injury of a man who shot himself in the head miraculously healing; a Beyonder who, having died from having his heart crushed, crawled out of his grave in the middle of the night-are these considered \"miracles\" of being resurrected from the dead? Is this the \"miracle\" the leader of the Secret Order, Zaratul, spoke of? And Sequence 2 of the Seer pathway is called a Miracle Invoker!At this moment, Klein felt like he had grasped something important, but he was unable to piece together all the clues to form the truth he wanted.\nAs I had guessed before, there are other factors at work for my choice of having Seer as my beginning Sequence... My greatest support is the mysterious space above the gray fog which happens to eliminate all interference and provide Seers the most coveted environment... My characteristic of \"resurrection\" also seems to have come from the gray fog as well...\nWhen I came to Backlund, the events in which Nimblewright Master Rosago was involved in were naturally drawn to me, which is consistent with the convergence of Beyonder characteristics of the same pathway. The higher \"quality\" it is, the stronger the attraction as the effects appear intermittently... The sudden change in the Antigonus family notebook's style of passing key information to me, related to the main peak of the Hornacis mountain range via the Misfortune Cloth Puppet, might also be a result of such elements...\nCombined with the other miscellaneous phenomena, does it mean that this mysterious space has a very close relationship with the Seer Beyonder pathway? That this is a Grade 0 Sealed Artifact of the corresponding Sequence? Or perhaps it's a divine kingdom left behind by a Sequence 0 of the same pathway?\nThere's also the possibility of it being the so-called \"Uniqueness\" of the Seer pathway...\nKlein moved his gaze away from Roselle's diary, his anticipation for advancing to a High-Sequence Beyonder increasing. He wondered what he would discover in the hidden area after he completed the staircase of light.\nPerhaps the reason for my transmigration and the way home will be found there...He suppressed his excitement and allowed Roselle's diary pages to disappear from his hands.\nAt the same time, he became increasingly wary of the leader of the Secret Order, Zaratul.\nHe was a powerful existence that had long since become a Miracle Invoker from the Seer pathway many years ago!\nThere might be times and matters that have his fingerprints hidden all over them!\nAlthough all of these thoughts were churning in his mind, Klein acted as though nothing had happened as he calmly said, \"You can begin your transactions.\"\nFors immediately turned to look at Miss Justice who sat on the same side of the table, and she said with expectation, \"I have received a reply. My teacher has a pair of Mirror Dragon eyes. The price is 1,000 pounds.\"\nUpon saying that, Fors felt a little uneasy. This was because Dorian Gray Abraham's reserve price was 800 pounds, which was already at a premium above the usual 500\u2013600 pounds. And on that foundation, she had added another 200 pounds.\nAfter attending so many Tarot Gatherings and all kinds of Beyonder circles, I finally understand one thing. Just like Emperor Roselle said, money isn't omnipotent, but nothing can be done without money...\nAlthough I've already received the fixed payment for my new book and have savings reaching 350 pounds, there's still the Spirit Eater stomach pouch awaiting me. There's also all kinds of expenses needed for Sequence 7, 6, 5, and even 4... The meaning before Mr. Fool's secret hint is that I should be able to be freed from the curse of the full moon once I become a High-Sequence Beyonder... Even if I can find some of them through Teacher, I can't fully rely on him and the Abraham family...\nIn this regard, saving up money on my own isn't enough, and efforts must be made to make money...\nThe price of 1,000 pounds is really expensive. If Miss Justice wishes to bargain, I'll later tell her that Teacher agreed to lower the price by 100 pounds after repeated negotiations...As Fors waited for the reply, she consoled herself.\n\"1,000 pounds?\" Audrey never expected to receive news for the Psychiatrist potion ingredients so quickly, so she subconsciously asked in a confirming tone.\nWithout waiting for a reply from Fors, she happily added, \"Okay, deal!\"\nAlthough she still owed Viscount Glaint a final installment and still owed The Fool's adorer 2,000 pounds, she would officially be declared an adult at the New Year's Ball. Not only would her control over her wealth be greater than ever before, but she would also receive many valuable gifts, such as the one promised by her father, Earl Hall, a few days earlier. He had promised to give his dear daughter a further 50,000 pounds in Backlund Bank shares and more than 2,000 pounds in cash. Hence, 1,000 pounds wasn't a number that she was bothered with.\nAudrey had originally asked Mr. Fool to extend the payment period of the 2,000 pounds to February or March in order, on the one hand, to pay off her debt to Viscount Glaint, and to save up money as discreetly as possible without arousing suspicion. On the other hand, she had to set aside an additional budget for the ingredients of the Psychiatrist potion.\nNow was the time to use the budget!\nAt most, I'll have to tighten my belt like how I did for the past few months. After March, there wouldn't be any problems!Audrey thought, not troubled at all.\nShe agreed? She agreed...Fors was both happy and confused.\nFors asked Mr. Fool to bear witness to the transaction and arranged for Miss Justice to make the payment first before she delivered the Beyonder ingredient on Wednesday. As Fors decided to head for Pritz Harbor immediately upon receiving the cash, without wasting any time in the middle, she looked at the three gentlemen-The Sun, The Hanged Man, and The World.\n\"Does anyone have any information on the Spirit Eater stomach pouch?\"\nAfter calming down, she discovered that with her experience in the acting method, she could digest the excess Beyonder characteristic much faster than she had expected. One week was almost equivalent to two weeks of the past.\nIn about ten days, she would be able to completely digest and resolve the problem.\nWhen she gathers the ingredients and advances to Trickmaster, she felt that she would be able to perfectly pass the first test given by her teacher, Dorian. She would gain more attention and would no longer be a mere student who was taken in out of gratitude.\nDerrick nodded and said, \"I was just about to tell you that during this exploration, we obtained some Spirit Eater stomach pouches. I can exchange it at low prices after I return to the City of Silver. Uh, that's under the premise that I'm no longer under surveillance.\"\n\"Okay, but it seems that you have no use for gold pounds?\" Fors asked directly.\nAfter the operation to save Little Sun, she had a preliminary understanding of the City of Silver.\nWithout waiting for The Sun to say a word, Alger interjected, \"You can hand me the corresponding cash or gold coins to me. 300 pounds is a very reasonable price. I will provide the Solar High Priest potion formula to The Sun.\"\n\"Mr. Hanged Man, you have the formula to Solar High Priest?\" Derrick asked in pleasant surprise.\nDuring his previous patrols and his recent explorations, he had increasingly felt that the powers of the Sun pathway were perfect for dealing with the dark.\nAlthough the Giant pathway's Sequence 6 Dawn Paladin could already create the light of dawn, in the realm of the Holy and Light, it's still inferior to a Light Suppliant!\nThe Hanged Man nodded slightly and said, \"That's right!\"\nHe had found the Solar High Priest potion formula in a treasury of the Rorsted Archipelago, but it was only recently that he had found an opportunity to provide sufficient justification and have the sufficient conditions to have the right to read it once.\nThe reason that he gave was that people suspected to be priests of the Church of the Eternal Blazing Sun had appeared on the Sonia Sea, and since he was temporarily unable to return to the Intis Republic, he could only search for the potion ingredients corresponding to Solar High Priest. Moreover, the hatred for the Eternal Blazing Sun could turn mere rumors into the basis for action by the Church of the Lord of Storms.\nDerrick was delighted at first, but he soon said with some awkwardness, \"The value of the Sequence 7 potion formula is higher than a Spirit Eater's stomach pouch. I... I don't have the gold pounds all of you were talking about.\"\n\"You can repay it with ingredients of the same value,\" The Hanged Man gave a terse response. \"But I don't know what I can get from you... First, you should make a list of the common monsters found around the City of Silver and their corresponding ingredients. I'll then choose from that list.\"\n\"No problem. After this exploration is over, I will do it as quickly as possible.\" Derrick was visibly relieved.\nBy the side, Klein wanted to facepalm, but in the end, he didn't manipulate The World to break the deal. It was because he also wanted to know what kind of monsters and ingredients were common around the City of Silver.\nAs Audrey secretly sighed, The Hanged Man looked around and raised his request.\n\"I need a pair of Dragon-Eyed Sea Condor eyes. I'll pay the necessary compensation.\"\nHe only mentioned the Dragon-Eyed Sea Condor eyes... In other words, Mr. Hanged Man has clues regarding the Blue Shadow Falcon's crystalline feathers... He really does have many channels and resources...Audrey, who had seen the potion formula for Wind-blessed, thought with some enlightenment.\nAfter the transactions came to an end, they began to freely exchange information about their areas, and the end of the Tarot Gathering quickly approached.\nDuring the process, The World inquired for clues about mermaids and obtained an answer similar to the one he had received from Sharron.\nWhen everything was over, Klein, who had been watching quietly, thought it necessary to warn Miss Justice and Miss Magician.\nA terrifying object that is suspected to be a Grade 0 Sealed Artifact has appeared around Prince Edessak. It might even involve 0-08, which would definitely not be a simple matter. Furthermore, the last time a similar situation occurred, Tingen City had faced the threat of an evil god's spawn, and it had almost disappeared from the map! Hence, now there's also a hidden danger in Backlund!Klein thought for a few seconds, making The World say in a hoarse voice, \"Ladies and gentlemen, I have recently received some information that a major event is brewing in Backlund. This will bring about a great deal of unrest and may lead to a tragedy.\"\n\"What's the major event?\" Audrey asked with concern.\nUnknowingly, her brow had begun to slightly furrow.\n\"I don't know.\" The World shook his head calmly.\n\"Where would the element of unrest and the possible tragedy come from?\" Fors asked nervously.\nFrom the previous gatherings, she had confirmed that Mr. World's sources were trustworthy.\nThe World acted stumped as he shook his head and said, \"There's contradictory information, making it impossible for me to give a definite answer.\"\nUpon saying this, he looked up and earnestly cast his gaze towards the figure within the gray fog at the end of the mottled table.\n\"Honorable Mr. Fool, your adorer in Backlund must've detected something, right?\"\nEveryone's eyes immediately focused towards the end of the long bronze table, with everyone feeling different feelings-curiosity, worry, anticipation, and tenseness.\nWith the attention on him, Klein leaned back and said in a casual tone, \"Edessak Augustus.\""}
{"num_chp":820,"summary":"Who is it?As a Sheriff, Xio had a sharp intuition for monitoring others and for being monitored by others. Her heart tensed up as her mind raced to consider what had just happened.\nIn the past two to three weeks, she hadn't encountered anything particularly noteworthy. The few criminals she apprehended weren't Beyonders, and they were, at best, related to certain gangs. No one would offend a famous bounty hunter in East Borough for them. Therefore, she quickly narrowed down the list of suspects, and she vaguely guessed at the spy's faction.\nA member from the Aurora Order? I didn't attend Mr. X's gathering, and an accident happened. Apparently, it was quite a stunning scene... The person from MI9 said that Mr. X was assassinated on the spot, and had his corpse taken away. Furthermore, the assassin had used powers at the demigod level... Is the Aurora Order investigating the possible culprits? Every invitee is in their sights?Although Xio was careless and short-tempered at times, her thought process was relatively direct. But in similar fields, she had a strong intuition that allowed her to figure out the crux of the matter.\nAnd on the matter regarding Mr. X's assassination, she had once been thankful that Fors had stopped her from attending; thus, avoiding the accident. On the other hand, she felt that there wasn't anything wrong about her, allowing her to stand up to the scrutiny of any investigation. Therefore, when she met the masked man from MI9 last week, she had been frank and confident, and she had accepted the mission to investigate the truth behind the matter. Unfortunately, she wasn't sure which other Beyonders had participated back then, and she had no clues to kick her off.\nHmm, that man from MI9 said that the members of Aurora Order are either lunatics or potential lunatics. You can't use common sense to guess at their actions. Even if they believe that there's nothing wrong with me, they can kill me in passing to vent their anger as a warning to the real murderer...The stressed Xio walked forward as she revised her path in East Borough.\nThis new route allowed her to obtain the help of friends at any time. If she suffered an ambush, there was a considerable chance that she could escape or kill the assailant.\nAs she walked, Xio's mind suddenly went into a daze, as she realized that she had unknowingly arrived back at her residence in Cherwood Borough at some point in time.\nXio entered blankly and drank a cup of water when she was patted on the shoulder by Fors.\n\"Accompany me to East Borough.\"\nXio was taken aback as she found herself saying something very familiar.\n\"You want to head out to gather material?\"\nFors immediately said that it wasn't the case, indicating that she had previously accepted a mission to find the dust left behind after a ghost faded away. As the deceased had been given a send-off by the priests at the cemetery to their respective deity's kingdom, there wasn't any ghosts. Thus, they could only head over to East Borough to find targets.\nXio hesitated and said, \"Can't you push it back a day? I'm planning to participate in Mr. X's gathering.\"\nFors immediately wore a bitter look and said that she had delayed it by too much, and the mission's deadline was looming.\nXio sighed and agreed to accompany her friend to East Borough to find a deceased person that had just died or one that hadn't been discovered after a period of time since their death.\nJust as the two were about to exit, Xio felt the wind strike her in the face as she trembled and snapped awake. She saw a wandering poet sitting in a corner, playing a seven-string guitar as he sang a folk song that was famous in the southern villages.\nXio frowned slightly as she rubbed her temples. She had a nagging feeling that her mind had gone adrift, but she couldn't remember what she was thinking about.\nShe continued maintaining her vigilance as she followed her originally set route, entering a bar that sold lunch. On the way, she met an East Borough resident who would occasionally provide her with intelligence.\nHe was a man who was either twenty-three or twenty-four years old. He had thinned his brows, and his brown hair reached his shoulders. His facial features were rather soft, and he had put on cheap makeup. He gave off quite an odd vibe.\n\"Sherman, did anything happen in the past few days?\" Xio greeted.\nAccording to what she knew, this young man named Sherman had always thought of himself as a woman. However, fate had played a terrible joke on him, making him a man. This made him suffer serious levels of ostracization for many years.\nSherman grinned and said, \"It's been peaceful. No man offered to buy me any drinks.\"\n\"Drinking is bad,\" Xio advised him seriously, walked past him, and walked to the bar counter.\nSherman spat as he walked to the entrance, swaying his hips until he arrived at the condominium he rented.\nHe paused at the door for nearly a minute before walking two steps to the side and knocking on the door next door.\nThe wooden door creaked open as a low, female voice sounded with an undeniable sweetness to it.\n\"Have you made your decision?\"\nSherman walked in and closed the door behind him. Looking towards the bed, he said to the black-dressed lady, \"I'm still doubtful. I don't believe that there's something as magical as that.\"\nTo him, the lady had a round face and a gentle and refined temperament. Not only was she sweet-looking, but she also had a different air to her. She was extremely charming and alluring.\nOf course, to Sherman, he was more envious instead of smitten.\nThe black-dressed lady replied with a deadpan expression, \"Haven't you seen the picture of my former appearance?\"\nHer gaze moved as she couldn't help but feel a sense of melancholy.\n\"But that might've been your twin brother. I find it difficult to believe that there really is a substance to change me into a woman...\" Sherman said in a wavering tone.\nThe black-dressed lady chuckled without any humor in it.\n\"Then, you can pretend that it's fake. You may leave.\"\nSherman's hands tightened as he fell silent for a long while.\n\"I-I'm willing to give it a try. Although I know that you might be bluffing me, I still wish to give it a try.\n\"Then, what should be the price I need to pay?\"\n\"Listen to my instructions, and help me do certain tasks. Don't worry. They will definitely be things you are capable of,\" the black-dressed lady said. \"To truly change your sex, you need to drink three potions and complete certain rituals. I'll guide you.\"\nUpon saying this, she said in a self-deprecating manner, \"You can consider your female name.\"\n...\nAt night, in the Backlund Bridge area, in a small alley at Iron Gate Street.\nXio stood under a street lamp that had been shattered by someone. She was recounting what had happened in the morning.\nAfter confirming that she wasn't being tailed, she returned to Cherwood Borough and secretly observed Fors. She discovered that her friend didn't head out at all, staying at home like she usually did. She spent most of her time reading novels, newspapers, and magazines. She also drew the curtains in her room for nearly an hour, as though she was familiarizing herself with her Beyonder powers. Until she had nothing to do, she got a piece of paper and spent fifteen minutes writing the opening to her new book. Finally, she tore it apart, crumbled it into a ball, and threw it into the trash can.\nShe smokes and drinks excessively...Xio silently clenched her teeth when she saw a figure in a black suit walking out of the shadows from the other end of the alley.\nThe man was tall and wore a golden mask that revealed his eyes, nostrils, mouth, and cheeks. He was none other than the MI9 member who was in contact with Xio.\n\"Is there anything urgent?\" he asked directly.\nAlthough Xio was short, she said in a similarly domineering manner, \"I was tailed in East Borough. I suspect that it's someone from the Aurora Order. They seem to be investigating what happened during the gathering.\"\nThe topic Xio had prepared to talk about was about someone she was asked to look for. She planned on using a clue that couldn't be confirmed, to make a request for the emergency meeting to appear normal. However, she now had a more suitable excuse thanks to the Aurora Order.\n\"The lunatics from the Aurora Order are like that. Although they know that we're also investigating the matter and are finding them, they don't shrink back. If it's not because of that, they wouldn't always be suffering setbacks,\" the golden-masked man said with a laugh. \"To be frank, I'm very surprised that they didn't directly surround you and bring you to a secluded place to interrogate and channel your spirit.\"\nXio was about to answer him that the Aurora Order member didn't tail her for long when she suddenly recalled the dazed feeling she found inexplicable. Hence, she deliberated and mentioned, \"I'm not sure what I encountered. For a very brief period of time, I seemed to be in a daze and can't remember what I recalled.\"\nThe golden-masked man fell silent. After nearly twenty seconds, he said, \"The investigation pertaining to you should have ended... The importance the Aurora Order has placed on this matter has exceeded my imagination. I will report this matter.\n\"Hmm... You mentioned that many Beyonders received the invitation but didn't attend?\"\nXio nodded and said, \"The participants of each gathering doesn't exceed a third of the number of people invited.\n\"This is mostly normal for a gathering. It's not an exception for Mr. X's gathering either.\"\nThe golden-masked man considered for a moment before asking, \"Are there any clues about the person I got you to search for?\"\n\"The person whose original name was Trissy?\" Xio shook her head after seeing him nod. \"Not yet. She's likely experienced.\"\nThe golden-masked man immediately chuckled.\n\"The number of people she has killed is more than the number of bounty missions you have completed. If you have any clues, make sure not to approach her. She's highly dangerous.\"\nXio tersely answered and focused on the main topic at hand.\n\"Is there a new commission?\"\n\"Why have you suddenly become so proactive?\" the golden-masked man asked in surprise.\nXio frankly replied, \"I'm almost about to save up enough points to exchange for the Interrogator potion formula. I wish to obtain it early.\"\n\"Actually, there's no need for that. You can directly exchange it for the potion, as it will save quite a bit of points,\" the golden-masked man suggested in Xio's behalf.\nI already have the Beyonder characteristic!Xio shook her head and said, \"That would still take a very long time. I might be able to buy the ingredients at other Beyonder gatherings.\"\nThe golden-masked man didn't insist as he said with a laughing sigh, \"I wish you luck.\n\"This time, it's a rather complicated commission. If you can complete it, you should have enough points.\"\nXio held back her delight and asked, \"What's the mission?\"\nThe masked man said with a slightly odd tone, \"Take note of the people Viscount Stratford interacts with, and list them down in a report before submitting it to me.\n\"There's no need for you to frequently monitor him. Whenever you are free or walk past, take note of it in passing. Trust me, you aren't the only one working on this mission. As long as you hand over a report of certain value a week, it'll be considered as you contributing a certain amount. This can be repeated every week.\"\nViscount Stratford...Xio suddenly fell into a daze again, but this time, she knew why.\nThis viscount was the captain of the royal guards; he was once her father's deputy!"}
{"num_chp":1311,"summary":"Emlyn vaguely sensed that there might be some abnormalities in the two Beyonder pathways of Earth and Moon, but he didn't ask Archbishop Loreto about it directly.\nHe doesn't seem like he would answer... It's better to wait for the next Tarot Gathering to ask The World, The Hanged Man, and the others... Emlyn nodded indiscernibly, indicating that he already knew the difference between a Favored and a Blessed as he muttered to himself.\nHe didn't consider seeking Mr. Fool's answer, because he felt that there was no need since the corresponding problem wasn't too important. After all, the Sanguine's Dukes, Marquises, and Counts were still alive and well, and there hadn't been any particularly negative news regarding the Church of Earth Mother.\nAt the same time, his previous guess also made Emlyn connect these to the influence the Primordial Moon, an existence which was perhaps an evil god or a high-level Devil in disguise, had on the Moon pathway. \"He\" had once caused many Sanguine who had prayed to \"Him\" to lose control, turning into monsters that only knew how to mate and reproduce.\nEmlyn suspected that this was one of the evil existences that sent the fake visions and revelations.\nWith no more questions from him, Loreto put away the document in his hand and thought for a moment before saying, \"This is the problem that requires special attention.\n\"In addition, I hope that you can set up three to five Beyonder teams in Backlund. They should mainly be members of the Sanguine.\"\nEmlyn was always law-abiding. The only crime he did was steal blood at the hospital. He subconsciously raised his question, \"Does the Church of Evernight and the Church of Storms have any objections?\"\nLoreto said with a benevolent smile, \"This was a request from them.\n\"As most of the forces of the Church of Steam have withdrawn, there is a lack of official Beyonders in Loen.\n\"Although the Church of Evernight and the Church of Storms have also recruited a group of Machinery Hivemind members who don't wish to leave Loen, and the lower-ranking clergymen, they are ultimately just a minority. Furthermore, they still need to handle the purge in Feysac and the independent colonies overseas. Therefore, they hope that they can provide some help.\n\"This is quite beneficial for our proselytizing in Loen. However, you have to remember that, here, we have to restrain ourselves. We can't freely proselytize. Just be on the same level as the remnant Church of Steam. Of course, our believers won't be able to catch up to the Church of Steam for a long period of time. This requires a generation, two generations, or even three generations of effort.\"\nYes, maintaining the present scale and having a certain degree of development is enough... It's too troublesome to proselytize... Emlyn heaved a sigh of relief and calmly replied, \"Okay.\"\n...\nIn the Sonia Sea, City of Generosity, Bayam.\nAlger wore a bishop's robe embroidered with symbols of lightning and waves. He wore a metal Storm Sacred Emblem and stood at the peak of the coastal mountain range, looking out at the other side of the forest.\nThere were very few trees there. The surrounding hills and short mountains had been flattened, revealing a hidden harbor.\nIt was a private harbor that belonged to the Resistance. It was definitely not comparable to Bayam's port, but it was of medium size, enough to sustain many people's lives.\nA city with an unconstrained and crude style had been built near the harbor. The city wasn't huge, probably only one-fifth the size of Bayam or smaller.\nIn the center were two towers. One was a spire, the other steeple. They were all strangely silver, reflecting blinding light under the sun.\nSurrounding the twin towers were many paved roads made of cement. They led to buildings that were mainly made of stone or were connected to open squares and training grounds. The green trees lining the sides of the street exuded a feeling of grandeur.\nAlger knew that the city didn't only consist of residents from the City of Silver, but also people from Moon City.\nMany of the latter were extremely deformed. They were temporarily unwilling to interact with Bayam, as well as the residents of the other cities on the island. They only purchased their necessities through the people of the City of Silver.\nIt was said that they planned on building a city that belonged to them deep in the forest, and would only leave a path to the new City of Silver.\nThese are all believers of Mr. Fool. I'll have to slowly integrate them into the entirety of the Rorsted Archipelago... For now, I'll temporarily not disturb the deformed and allow the residents of the City of Silver to bring normal-looking Moon City residents to Bayam... Alger seriously considered his subsequent actions.\nAfter settling down the residents of the City of Silver and Moon City, he had actually completed the mission that Mr. Fool had given him. However, he believed that he was still far from being able to exchange for Sea God's identity, authority, and status. Therefore, he did his best to deal with the problems left behind by the \"great migration.\"\nTo be frank, Alger was most worried that Mr. Fool didn't give him anything to do. If that happened, he didn't know how long it would take for him to make enough contributions.\nAccompanying the new City of Silver's establishment and the immense vibrancy it exuded, he acutely sensed danger.\nThere was more than one Sequence 4 demigod in the City of Silver and Moon City, and they were Mr. Fool's loyal believers. Perhaps, Mr. Fool would one day bestow the identity, status, authority, and power of Sea God to one of them!\nThere are two Grade 0 Sealed Artifacts in the City of Silver, a Sequence 3 saint, three Sequence 4 saints, and nearly ten Grade 1 Sealed Artifacts, as well as a few demigod Beyonder characteristics that can temporarily be used as Grade 1 Sealed Artifacts... There are three demigods in Moon City, five Grade 1 Sealed Artifacts, and a large number of potion formulas... This... Alger only made a slight calculation before realizing that the two factions that came under Mr. Fool were a little terrifying.\nAll of them combined was equivalent to a quarter of the Church of Storms!\nAccording to what Alger knew, the number of Grade 0 Sealed Artifacts each Church had numbered between five to eight. There were fewer than four Grounded Angels active at present. In this aspect, they were indeed much stronger than the combined Moon City and City of Silver.\nHowever, the orthodox Churches had no advantage in numbers when it came to Grade 1 Sealed Artifacts and saints, especially the latter.\nDue to an all-out war, with the brass increasing the number of saints by nurturing them, the Church of Storms only had around twenty saints.\nThe Church of the Sea God doesn't have a demigod yet, but it won't be long before a new Sea God will appear... As for the angels under Mr. Fool, there's The World, the Death Consul, and the angel of the Fate pathway... There are the saints from our Tarot Club... The more Alger thought about it, the more alarmed he became. He realized that he was a little slow in this aspect.\nPerhaps it was because he couldn't extricate himself to take an objective look at things, and although he had always been amazed by such matters, he finally came to a clear realization today:\nUnknowingly, Mr. Fool's faction had already developed to a level that was comparable to an orthodox Church. Even if there was a certain gap, it was only due to the lack of accumulation that needed to span across years.\nAnd it hadn't even been three years since Alger joined the Tarot Club!\nIf I hadn't experienced all these changes myself, I definitely wouldn't have believed it. Alger sighed inwardly as he fervently wished to do something for Mr. Fool so that he could quickly accumulate the contributions needed to transform into Sea God.\nWhen that happened, he could truly cast his gaze towards the Book of Calamity and attempt to complete the request of the elven queen, Cohinem.\nRetracting his gaze, Alger glanced at Bayam at the foot of the mountain. He saw that this city, which hadn't suffered any serious damage in the war, had once again lit up. It could also be called the most prosperous city in the Sonia Sea.\nAt that moment, the priests, bishops, and believers of the Church of the Lord of Storms were cooperating with the new government civil servants and the Church of Sea God to build schools and hospitals to the children in the slums and the natives with no financial capacity that would provide education, medical treatment, and assistance.\nAs Alger watched the people walking along the streets like ants and the colorful buildings that were different from the vast majority of Loen, the corners of his mouth curled up slightly before he wiped away his smile.\nHe narrowed his eyes, unsure what he was experiencing or enjoying.\nAt that moment, a grayish-white fog suddenly appeared in front of him.\nFollowing that, he saw the ancient palace and blurry figure in the middle of the fog. He heard Mr. Fool's words:\n\"A mission. Monitor a man named Verdu Garcia.\"\nAlong with the revelation, plenty of miscellaneous information rained down and drilled into Alger's mind, allowing him to know the exact situation of Verdu Garcia.\nHe was a member of the Abraham family that had concealed his identity. He had recently left Desi County and had come to the Rorsted Archipelago.\nAlger was thrilled. He bowed his head respectfully in response. \"By your will.\"\n...\nKlein knew that Verdu Garcia Abraham had left the Northern Continent and was heading to the Rorsted Archipelago, as Dorian Gray had mentioned this when he prayed.\nHe knew very well that the person named Verdu yearned to save Mr. Door so that the King of Angels could return to the real world.\nThe reason why Klein had gotten Miss Magician to inform the Abraham family of one of the rituals that helped Mr. Door escape was because the trust between the two parties was insufficient. If he were to hide it or lie by saying that an angel needed to be hunted for the ritual, the Abraham family would definitely suspect Fors and make her continue contacting Mr. Door and try to confirm it through other means.\nOnce they discovered anything, Klein would lose control of the Abraham family, preventing him from nipping the problem in the bud.\nIf it had been a few years ago, Klein wouldn't have been too worried about such problems. However, as the apocalypse approached, the infiltration of the Outer Deities would only increase. It was possible that a member of the Abraham family would come into contact with a corresponding item or believer and obtain the correct ritual.\nTherefore, Klein believed that the ritual that was extremely difficult to complete could be used to effectively gain the trust of the Abrahams, allowing them to deepen their faith in Mr. Fool and become more devout. Then, he could monitor the extreme ones among the devout and grasp their trajectories, and interfere with them in time."}
{"num_chp":971,"summary":"Chapter 971 Restraint\nOn the observation deck of the liner, the bugle was sounded. It tore through the obstacles put up by the wind and rain, awakening all the passengers on board.\nUnable to dress up in time, they could only don a coat or their pajamas, rushing barefoot to the window to observe the situation outside.\nHalf of the passengers quickly saw a gigantic sailboat that didn't adhere to common sense. They saw its three pitch-black sails and the blob of pale flickering yellow amidst the dark environment.\nTogether with the howling winds, spattering rain, and the moonless and starless night sky, many passengers felt as though the ship was approaching them from hell, bringing with it an inexplicable sense of horror and dominance.\nAfter a brief pause and frenzy, a name surfaced in their minds: Black Emperor!\nAnyone who had been out at sea for some time, or people who lived in port cities in the various colonies, more or less knew the existence of such a pirate ship!\n\"Sigh, may the Storm be with you and me.\"\n\"May the Goddess watch over us!\"\n\"Holy Lord of Storms!\"\nAs the passengers subconsciously made prayers, they were filled with horror and helplessness.\nThese passengers knew very well that the owner of the Black Emperor had the highest bounty on the Five Seas. In a particular sense, he was the King of Pirates, and was a powerful figure who could remain alive despite the campaigns of the various fleets from different nations. He was definitely not someone the cannons and crew of a liner could resist.\nThis meant that they were about to fall into the hands of pirates!\nMany women couldn't help but imagine being raped by the pirates and being sold to unfamiliar lands. Some trembled while others collapsed to the ground. Some rummaged for daggers or revolvers; it was unknown if they wanted to resist, or if they were unwilling to face the worst outcome. Having failed to find weapons, some moved a clothes rack to their side.\nThe men didn't react any better. Apart from a number of them drawing weapons in a bid to organize themselves to resist, the remaining froze in a daze or sought places to hide. Other cursed the darn liner and the King of the Five Seas.\nFinally, the captain's voice boomed into the ears of every passenger via the broadcasting equipment or something else.\n\"Silence! Don't be afraid!\n\"The owner of the Black Emperor has his own code. He's not like other pirates. His subordinates can only plunder for items and wealth, nothing else!\nSuch words were repeated a few times as the panicking passengers finally calmed down and no longer exhibited such horror.\nCompared to the outcomes they had imagined, being able to live and not be raped was an excellent outcome.\nAlmost a minute late, a number of passengers were overwhelmed with sadness and cried upon realizing how their hard-earned savings would be wiped out.\nSome of them were doing business through loans. If they were unable to pay their loans, it was possible that their family would end up on the streets, relying on the workhouses for survival.\nUpon having this thought, they hurriedly took action and hid their wealth in all kinds of hidden compartments, hoping to keep as much as they could from the pirates. After doing this, they held their weapons tight, prepared to fight the pirates to the death at critical moments.\nEven feral beasts would fight back when cornered, why not humans?\nAt this moment, many of the pirates on the Black Emperor were waiting by the broadside according to their orders. They were prepared to jump onto the prey once the distance was closed.\nTheir second mate, Horror Viscount Bird Mustang was holding a telescope as he observed the liner opposite him without much thought. He was inwardly calculating how much longer before the two ships met.\nThis pirate, whose bounty had exceeded ten thousand pounds, wore an Intis-styled shirt with complicated patterns on his sleeves and collars. He donned a dark red captain's attire, as though he was awaiting the commencement of a ball, and not a pirate attack.\nSuddenly, his vision blurred and he could no longer see the liner!\nBird Mustang hurriedly searched with his telescope, but regardless of the direction he aimed it at, there was nothing but stormy waves and red-headed sea eagles who enjoyed hunting fish during storms.\nSuch a huge liner had vanished!\nThe light in Bird Mustang's eyes flickered as he failed to make an accurate judgment.\n\"Where's the ship?\"\n\"Where did such a huge ship go?\"\n\"It was still around!\"\nThe pirates on deck also noticed something amiss as they exclaimed.\nA ghost ship? No, there aren't any ghost ships with such a make. This is a steam and sail hybrid that got popular in recent decades... An illusion? Someone had hidden a liner with a large-scale illusion? An illusion at this scale has to have been done by a demigod... Bird Mustang's thoughts raced as he retracted his telescope and headed for the cabin.\nDuring this process, the distance he traveled seemed to distort. In about eight steps, Bird Mustang covered quite a sizable distance and arrived in front of the captain's cabin. He reverently bowed and said, \"Earl Nast, something abnormal has happened with the hunt.\"\nOn the Black Emperor, King of the Five Seas Nast continued having himself addressed as an earl, as it was a title conferred upon him by Emperor Roselle.\nOf course, he had publicly announced that it was a matter of time before he established a pirates' kingdom, becoming a duke, king, or even an emperor.\nAfter a brief silence, a solemn voice sounded from the captain's cabin:\n\"Circle around it.\"\n\"By your will!\" Bird Mustang didn't ask why as he directly accepted the order.\nOf course, he could imagine the reason.\nBe it an illusion or not, to make such a huge steam and sail hybrid liner vanish from the scrutiny of hundreds of pirates, it was definitely not something a Low- or Mid-Sequence Beyonder could accomplish. The ship definitely had a demigod or a powerhouse wielding a demigod-level Sealed Artifact!\nAnd to clash with an unknown demigod for an ordinary liner was definitely an irrational act. Even if the Earl of White Maple Nast, as the King of the Five Seas, he wouldn't do such rash acts unless there was something worth fighting for.\nFrom this angle, the demigod was only hiding on the liner and had not launched any counterattack. This also implied that he didn't wish to clash with the Black Emperor and the King of the Five Seas. Therefore, he had only exhibited his existence for shock and awe purposes.\nBird Mustang immediately got the sailors to leave the broadside and turn the Black Emperor around.\nAt this point, a huge and heavy red-headed sea eagle suddenly flew out of its flock and headed for the Black Emperor, spiraling above the ghost ship.\nAmidst the pirates' confusion, the red-headed sea eagle looked down upon the deck and spoke deeply in a human's voice:\n\"I wish to meet the Earl of White Maple.\"\nBird Mustang was taken aback for a second before he cast his eyes at the cabin.\nKing of the Five Seas Nast's solemn voice sounded again. Instead of directly answering the sea eagle, he instructed his subordinates, \"Let him in.\"\nBird Mustang immediately followed the order as the sea eagle swooped down in the storm. Its body gradually changed and turned into a humanoid form.\nWhen it landed on the deck, it was no longer a red-headed sea eagle, but a man with a tall top hat and tuxedo. His face wore a feathered mask.\nBird Mustang's eyes dilated slightly as though he was trying to take in the figure clearer.\nBut no matter how much he observed it, he was unable to discover anything abnormal about this exaggerated man. It was as though there wasn't a red-headed sea eagle from the very beginning.\nA few seconds later, Bird Mustang's pupils dilated even more because he saw the figure's side profile when it walked past him.\nThis man, who appeared like he was an invitee at a banquet, was very thin. His side profile was about the width of two fingers!\nAt that instant, Bird Mustang felt as though he was seeing a walking paper figurine, but it was also slightly thicker than one!\nA monster... He gulped with great difficulty as he watched the terrifying demigod walk towards the cabin.\nThe pirates on deck quickly retreated and leaned against the shipboard as though a nightmare had just walked past them.\nTo them, this abnormally proportioned man was something they had never seen before. It was more harrowing than the many monsters they had seen in the past.\nAt the third story of the cabin, outside the captain's cabin.\nKlein held the handle, twisted it, and opened the door.\nThe reason he had made himself appear so strange was partially due to having no choice, but it was also partially deliberate. The former was because the red-headed sea eagle wasn't big enough, so after creating the clothes and mask, there was no way to create a normal human's body, even without the innards. The deliberate choice was because he was beginning to try out his theories on acting as a Bizarro Sorcerer. He had some ideas regarding this:\nThe term \"Sorcerer\" wasn't key. What was key was to use the methods of a sorcerer to appear bizarre!\nWith a light creak, the dark black door opened, revealing the interior of the captain's cabin.\nCandle lamps drooped down from above, with 41 on the left and 40 on the right in an asymmetrical manner. At the end of it, a black platform rose up, surrounding an iron-black chair.\nKing of the Five Seas Nast's figure was relatively normal. He was slightly taller than 1.9 meters, unlike the nonhuman form which resembled a giant that Klein had previously encountered.\nHe was still wearing a miniaturized crown with a black robe with silver ends. He had a squarish face with slight wrinkles. He had a short black mustache underneath his chin, and his black eyes swirled with a red glow. It made one bow their heads without realizing it.\n\"I've never met you before,\" Nast said in a deep voice, \"Mr. Bizarro Sorcerer.\"\nKlein took off his hat and bowed.\n\"You know me now.\"\nNast made his voice which made Spirit Bodies tremble resound inside the captain's cabin.\n\"Speak. Why are you visiting me?\"\n\"Emperor, I wish to know of your impression of Emperor Roselle. Everyone knows that you and your father have met \u2018Him' in the past far more than once,\" Klein replied without being affected.\nNast swept the paper figurine-like demigod as his dark red light brightened significantly.\n\"Have a seat first.\"\nBefore he finished his sentence, Klein felt a potent suppressive force on him. His body involuntarily sat on a chair beside him.\nHowever, he was only here as a marionette. With a flick of the Spirit Body Threads, the figure that was thin as a book had quickly restored its balance."}
{"num_chp":748,"summary":"Inside the Lightning Cathedral, the high and spacious dome arched continuously. There wasn't any blank space, with gold and blue as the main colors. It made anyone who walked beneath it subconsciously feel that the place was sacred and solemn; thus, making them bow their heads.\nAlger Wilson often made contact with a secret existence, and he often gathered in the palace of a deity's residence. As a result, he no longer had a longing for this. He wasn't as respectful as before, but he still had to put on an act. Like the other sailors around him, he kept his head down as he lightened his footsteps without even daring to breathe clearly.\nIn the silent atmosphere, they were led by the priest all the way to the clergymen's quarters at the back of the cathedral, with each of them getting a room.\nAfter closing the door, Alger saw the sanguine moonlight shine into the window. It made the environment turn cold and sinister, as though countless wraiths seemed to be observing the real world through a thin curtain.\nEvery time the Blood Moon appeared, one's spirituality would be enhanced. Powers that stemmed from spirituality and hell would receive a significant boost, while the negative emotions of living beings reached an explosive state. The higher the Sequence, the more obvious it would be.\nFaintly, Alger heard sobbing, low shouts, and whispering. This was completely different from the solemnity he previously felt in the Lightning Cathedral.\nIllusory arms appeared before his eyes as they reached outwards from the walls, floor, and ceiling, like a three-dimensional pale forest.\nAlger knew of the abnormalities of the Blood Moon, so he removed his captain's hat without panicking at all. He entered the bathroom and washed his face.\nDuring this process, he suddenly heard a distant singing voice.\nThe singing voice was indistinct, as though it came from the middle of the island. It kept echoing endlessly as though it was right beside Alger. It didn't make him feel horrified, for it was akin to a woman who was away from her family and loved ones, singing slowly and sadly as she looked at the surging tides.\nAlger pulled at a towel and wiped his face before cocking his head to listen.\nHe gradually frowned as he took out a small iron box from his priest robe's inner robe and placed it close to his ear.\nIn it was the Ocean Songster Beyonder characteristic he had purchased from The World. He suspected that the residual mental imprint on it was temporarily enhanced by the Blood Moon.\nAs the metal box came close, the singing by Alger's ears instantly became partially clear, melancholic, sorrowful, wistful, and painful.\nBut apart from that, there was still the ethereal and ancient voice sounding from it, forming a clear boundary with the clear singing as though they were in a duet!\nWhose voice is that? It sounds like an elf's... An item in the Church that stems from the elves? This Ocean Songster Beyonder characteristic on me comes from an elf?Alger nodded as he came up with a theory.\nDue to them sharing the same Sailor pathway, the Church of Storms had always been in search of elvish relics. They were used to concoct potions, made into Sealed Artifacts, or isolated underground. Those with relatively fewer negative effects were rewarded to clergymen; therefore, it wasn't odd that something similar would be stimulated on the night of the Blood Moon.\nIf it's a mystical item, there wouldn't be a problem. If it's a Sealed Artifact, it means it's definitely not simple if the voice can penetrate the isolation barrier...Alger reined in his thoughts, brushed his teeth, and went to bed.\nHe soon fell asleep and had a dream.\nAfter an unknown period of time, Alger suddenly felt a little lucid, vaguely aware that he was having a dream, but he automatically sized up his surroundings.\nHe discovered that above him was rippling dark blue seawater which was stacked up layer after layer and blocked the view of the sky. Ahead of him was a beautiful palace made of coral. It was tall, spectacular, dark, and gloomy.\nAlger subconsciously walked towards the palace, walking into the open doors.\nInside were columns of coral that held up an exaggerated dome. The walls and dome were filled with murals depicting the terror of a storm.\nOver a hundred meters away, there was a throne embedded with sapphires, emeralds, and lustrous pearls above a nine-stepped staircase that was extremely striking.\nAlger looked over and saw a woman in a complicated ancient dress sitting on it. Her hair was black and held up into a bun. Her facial outline was soft, and her features were exquisite. She had a beauty that seemed timeless.\nThe woman's expression was core and her ears sharp. Her deep brown eyes looked down at Alger from a commanding position.\nIn her hand was a golden wine cup with complicated patterns.\nAlger was just about to say something when her eyes emitted silver light resembling the bright flash of lightning, tearing through the dream.\nPhew...Alger sat up and subconsciously gasped for breath. He found the dream both blurry and clear at the same time.\nThe woman's appearance was blurry, as well as the details of the murals and coral palace, but her eyes that contained lightning and her sharp ears were clear.\nA high-ranking elf? Under the effects of the Blood Moon, her relics resonated with the Ocean Songster Beyonder characteristic I have, resulting in it influencing my dream?As Alger guessed, he wondered which item it would be.\nDue to his limited standing, the number of Sealed Artifacts and mystical items he knew were limited. However, he knew certain knowledge that others didn't know, so he quickly thought of a possible target.\nCalamity Cohinem?\nThe Book of Calamity \"She\" left behind has likely been sent to Pasu Island...\nAfter making the report and departing, I'll seek Mr. Fool's advice and see if there will be any unexpected influences regarding this matter...\nAlger didn't dare recite The Fool's honorific name in the Church of Storms's headquarters.\nAfter daybreak, he didn't show any signs of abnormality. Under the servant's lead, he entered a room with a long table, and he was questioned by three Mandated Punisher deacons.\nAmong these three deacons, only one of them possessed dark blue hair. This was because this wasn't a necessary change that would happen from consuming the Sailor pathway potion. However, this trait would quite stubbornly be passed down, just like the elves. Many of them with black hair would end up with blue hair. Nowadays, mixed-bloods with elvish blood mostly had blue hair.\nAlger sat at the end of the long table as he systematically answered the deacons' questions. He mentioned what he had done at sea, what he had planned to do, and what he had succeeded, as well as his failures.\nAnd this would be compared to the description from his crew to prevent anyone from lying.\nTowards the end of his report, the deacon with dark blue hair glanced at Alger. He asked with a hoarse voice, \"Do you know Admiral of Stars Cattleya?\"\nNot only do I know her...Alger was nearly taken aback as he answered after some thought, \"I met her at the pirate convention.\"\nThe deacon didn't harp on the question as he directly said, \"Think of means to get to know her. Try to investigate Gehrman Sparrow's situation from her.\"\nSo that's how it is... It's because Gehrman hunted Admiral of Blood?Alger deliberately asked, feigning his ignorance, \"What did Gehrman Sparrow do again?\"\nThe dark blue-haired deacon said in a peeved manner, \"He nearly destroyed Bayam! Alright, this isn't something you should know. In summary, remember. Gehrman Sparrow is a very dangerous person. There's a secret cult backing him. That organization has a demigod that's at odds with the Rose School of Thought!\"\nNearly destroyed Bayam? A demigod in the organization? At odds with the Rose School of Thought?Alger deliberately didn't hide his shock.\nHe originally imagined that a focus was placed on Gehrman because of his hunting of Admiral of Blood Senor, but who knew that the reason was far more complicated and ludicrous than he had imagined!\nWhat did Gehrman Sparrow do? When I pass by Bayam, I should find the actual spot to take a look... Also, isn't our Tarot Club's archenemy the Aurora Order? Isn't Mr. Fool always targeting the True Creator? Why did it change, no-why is there the additional Rose School of Thought?Alger muttered to himself inwardly.\nAs for the Tarot Club having a demigod, he wasn't surprised. He even found it logical. How could an ancient existence not have a demigod under \"Him?\"\nBesides, back when Vice Admiral Hurricane Qilangos died silently in a strange manner, he was already convinced that Mr. Fool had a High-Sequence Blessed!\nThankfully, my meeting with Gehrman was very secretive; otherwise, things would be troublesome...Alger listened in silence without asking any questions. Like before, he accepted the missions and got up to leave the room.\n...\nBacklund's North Borough, outside 160 B\u00f6klund Street. Servants stood in two rows to welcome their master's arrival.\nWith white hair at his temples and deep blue eyes, Dwayne Dant\u00e8s wore a tailcoat and a top hat with an inlaid gold cane. Together with Butler Walter and Valet Richardson, he walked in between his servants and arrived at the entrance of the three-story building.\nWaiting there was Housekeeper Taneja who he had long selected.\nShe was in her early forties, and her hair was tied neatly. She had ordinary looks but wore an experienced demeanor. She wore gold-rimmed glasses and a black-and-white dress which was different from the other maidservants.\nFrom the information received and the interview, Klein knew that this lady was born in East Borough. She was a believer of the Evernight Goddess, and she had chosen to be trained by a charitable organization by the Church at the age of fifteen, making her become a qualified maidservant.\nAfter more than ten years of hard work, as well as the free lessons from the night schools, she was promoted from the lowest-ranking maidservant in a tycoon's household to a lady's maid. She later followed the tycoon's daughter when she got married, and she became a housekeeper until the family met with a financial crisis, forcing her to leave. She was extremely experienced when it came to managing a household.\nAfter this lady signed the contract, she received 1,000 pounds from Dwayne Dant\u00e8s as petty cash for the month before entering an argument with Butler Walter on whether they should purchase or rent a carriage.\nFrom her point of view, since Mr. Dant\u00e8s's goal was to enter high society and move into West Borough, or even Empress Borough, a carriage needed to be custom made to not appear inadequate. Before that, they could rent a high-end carriage for a year and wait until there was hope of him becoming a noble before they had one custom made. It was a more reasonable choice that didn't waste money or appear inadequate.\nShe convinced Walter, and of course Klein. This was because renting a high-end carriage with the horse costs only 88 pounds, and a two-wheeled carriage costs only 42 pounds.\nOf course, someone who controls the household's expenditures needs to be someone who's good at accounting...Klein felt poignant as he smiled at Taneja before stepping through the three-story house's door.\nThis was the stage for which the tycoon, Dwayne Dant\u00e8s, would be acting on."}

It was unknown when a dagger smeared with \u2018black paint' appeared in her hand.\nPoof!\nShe struck quickly, plunging the dagger into Frye's lower back.\nBut at this moment, the scene in front of her shattered, as if everything was an illusion.\nTrissy realized that she was still standing on the window sill, still looking over the grassy field and the steel fence.\nExcept this time around, it wasn't only Corpse Collector Frye who was standing outside the fence. There was also Leonard Mitchell who was aiming straight at the window sill, as well as Dunn Smith. The captain of the Nighthawks was hunched over as he pressed down on his glabella, his eyes closed as formless ripples spread outwards from him.\nTrissy's pupils constricted. She understood that everything that had happened was just a dream. She had fallen asleep unknowingly!\nBang! Bang! Bang!\nLeonard and Frye fired three shots, accurately hitting the invisible target who was still waking up from her reverie.\nCrack!\nTrissy's figure started to appear, first cracking, then completely shattering into fragments of a rough silver mirror!\nInside the building, Trissy, who had used a substitution spell, turned around to escape. She followed the corridor and the steps, sprinting all the way to the first floor.\nWhoosh!A cold sinister wind blew across the first floor, one that could freeze a person. Formless, transparent figures were numbly pacing around every corner of the building in a daze.\nTrissy, who had lost her concealment, felt her temperature drop every time she passed through the spirits. She could no longer control her shivers when she finally reached the sacrificial altar.\nThe altar was a round table, with a figurine of a deity carved out of bone placed in the center.\nThis figurine was about the size of a grown man's head, with only a mere indication of her eyes, but the figure was that of a beautiful woman.\nHer hair extended from her head to her heels, each strand clear and thick, as if they were poisonous snakes or tentacles.\nThere was only one eye situated at the tip of every strand of hair, some closed, others open.\nThere were many puppets strewn around the figurine. The craftsmanship of the puppets was crude. Names and relevant information were written on the puppets; for example, Joyce Mayer.\nThere were three candles on the table, flickering with a yellowish-green flame despite the cold, sinister winds.\nTrissy bowed at the deity's figurine and quickly recited her incantations.\nShe then pushed away the puppets and extinguished the flames of the candles before picking the figurine up.\nWhoosh!\nThe winds howled fiercely as they shook the closed windows violently.\nClank! Creak!Shards of glass flew around in all directions.\nFrye, who had just made his way to the other side of the building, didn't dare to barge into the sacrificial altar recklessly. He shivered, feeling his blood turn cold and frosty. It was making his actions visibly slower.\nSuddenly, he felt tightness around his heels as though they had been grabbed by something invisible.\nAn accentuated sense of coldness spread upwards from the point of contact. A Sequence 9 Beyonder would have turned completely numb by now. But as a Corpse Collector, Frye was no stranger to such situations.\nHe turned his revolver to the side of his heels and pulled the trigger. It was as if he could see who the enemy was, and exactly where it was.\nBang!\nA silver demon hunting bullet pierced the air, causing a shrill howl in response.\nThe formless figure dissipated and Frye regained his ability to move.\nElsewhere, Dunn Smith, who wanted to reach the second floor by avoiding a frontal assault on the altar, was similarly affected by the cold winds. His body froze as he stopped right outside a shattered window.\nWhoosh!The curtains behind the window lifted suddenly and engulfed Dunn, as if a monster had just opened its mouth to devour its prey.\nThe curtain wrapped around Dunn's head, seeming to have been imbued with life. Dunn's facial features began to press through the constricting cloth.\nDunn, who was about to be suffocated, stomped down with both feet. He straightened his knees and twisted his waist, loosening the curtain's grip with raw strength alone.\nHe grabbed a corner of the curtain around his head with his left hand and yanked it away before tossing it toward the ground.\nBang!\nHe fired a shot at the other half of the curtain behind the window, stopping it from attempting another assault on him.\nThe curtain stopped immediately as a dark red liquid oozed out from it.\nWhoosh!\nOn the field, Leonard Mitchell was reciting his poems and was also hit by the cold sinister winds infused with the intense sensation of death. His teeth chattered, making it hard for him to enunciate his poems.\nThe messy weeds in the garden suddenly extended, wrapping themselves around his heels. A black shadow hurled itself at him along with the violent winds.\nLeonard, whose body had become rigid, failed to fire in time. He could only pull back his shoulder and raise his arm.\nThud!The black shadow smashed into his forearm, the thorns on its body piercing his skin.\nIt was a pretty, bright-red flower, its origins unknown.\nIn pain, Leonard tossed aside the flower dyed with his blood.\nBang!He fired a shot at the spreading vines, causing dark red liquid to ooze out.\nTap! Tap! Tap!Leonard quickened his pace and charged towards the shattered window on the first floor where the altar was situated behind.\nThe vines retracted abruptly from where he had previously stood, as if hiding from something invisible.\nTrissy took advantage of the chaos created by destroying the altar and a suspension-style ritual to conceal herself once again. She managed to fool the Spirit Visions of the Nighthawks and escape the pincer attack before making her way to a spot behind the three Nighthawks.\nShe extended her right hand, immediately causing a cold wind to blow. It carried the flower dyed with Leonard's blood right into her palm.\nTrissy did not stop. With the flower in hand, she nimbly made her way over the steel fence and escaped in the direction of the Tussock River.\nLeonard, who had just entered the first level, turned his head abruptly, as though he was listening to something.\nHis expression changed. He frantically pulled up his sleeve and looked at the wound caused by the flower.\nWith his constitution, the wound had already stopped bleeding. There was only some red swelling that remained.\nLeonard's expression became grim. He pinched his left index finger and pulled his fingernail straight out!\nHis face contorted in pain, but he did not pause. As he recited something silently, he sliced open the coagulated wound with the fingernail. When the fingernail was dyed with his dark red blood, he pulled out a few strands of hair from his scalp and wrapped the fingernail with his hair.\nBeside the Tussock River, Trissy slowed down. She shot her gaze toward the flower in her hand.\nShe was chanting something as a ball of black, illusory fire suddenly appeared in her palm.\nThe flames enveloped the flower, burning it to ashes.\nAfter completing this, Trissy jumped into the river and submerged herself.\nAt the same time, Leonard tossed the blood-stained fingernail wrapped in his hair to the corner. He saw it burn and release a foul stench.\nThe fingernail and hair disappeared quickly, leaving only some dust behind.\nLeonard heaved a sigh of relief. He entered the first level through the window and said to Dunn and Frye who were destroying the altar, \"The target has escaped. But it's alright, our primary objective was to stop the ritual.\"\nDunn sighed and looked at the puppets on the table.\n\"She was very cautious and very powerful. She sensed us approaching her ahead of time, otherwise... she should be, at the very least, a Sequence 7 Beyonder.\n\"Give Klein the signal. Ask him to come over.\"\nThrough the brief interaction in the dream, he had determined that the enemy was female."}
{"num_chp":850,"summary":"\"Sounds like a contrived story. Ever since the new sea route was discovered, there has been no end to stories of people becoming rich from taking risks,\" Soest casually commented on the content of the telegram. As he thought, he looked towards a particular Red Glove. \"I recall that we had investigated Dwayne Dant\u00e8s before and had an exchange with him in his dream.\"\n\"Yes,\" the Red Glove who was responsible for the task nodded and replied. \"I didn't directly ask him about such matters, but I could tell that Dwayne Dant\u00e8s was very familiar with the Southern Continent. He had plenty of experience there.\"\nHeh heh, that might be information that Dwayne Dant\u00e8s deliberately revealed to you...Leonard had his doubts regarding the contents of the telegram, believing that this was another layer of disguise from an undying monster who had lived since the Fourth Epoch.\nHowever, he didn't inform his teammates about his conjectures, because he had no basis for them.\nSoest didn't pay great attention to the matter as he said, \"Do you have any problems with the clues related to Gehrman Sparrow?\"\n\"Since this crazy adventurer was still at sea in recent weeks, when did he come to Backlund?\" As a Nightmare, Cindy repeated her doubts, \"What I'm concerned about isn't the exact time, but whether he has the time to travel to Backlund. After all, we're rather far from the sea.\"\nSoest nodded gently and said, \"In the meeting, a deacon raised this question. According to the time and venue of Gehrman Sparrow's last sighting, he normally has no way to arrive in Backlund last night and complete an infiltration.\n\"Of course, I'm referring to normal circumstances.\n\"The missing servant told us that when he was sweeping the square, he suddenly lost control of his body. He froze on the spot and was unable to cry for help. Then, he saw bright colors like an abstract oil painting, and he felt that his body was floating upwards.\n\"Later, he lost consciousness, and after awakening, he found himself in a room in East Borough.\n\"The former matches with the Keeper's description of being possessed by a Wraith. The latter is suspected to be a Traveler's Teleport.\n\"If it really is Teleport, then Gehrman Sparrow can appear in Backlund at any moment.\"\nAs elites of the Nighthawks, the Red Gloves knew about the various Beyonder pathways far better than their colleagues which were at the same level. They were no strangers to Wraiths and Travelers.\nAfter listening to the captain's explanation, another Red Glove added in thought, \"It's rumored that Admiral of Blood, who was hunted by Gehrman Sparrow, is a Wraith.\"\nThe details matched!\nAnd as for Gehrman Sparrow being able to obtain the powers to become a Wraith, it wasn't unacceptable. The easiest method was to find an Artisan to make one's prey into a mystical item.\nCindy recalled even more information with this stimulus.\n\"It's said that Gehrman Sparrow has the ability to change his appearance... And the infiltrator had disguised himself as the Keeper.\"\nAnother detail matched!\n\"Excellent thinking,\" Soest raised his hand to rub this temples. \"According to these details, we can come to a preliminary consensus that the infiltrator is Gehrman Sparrow. And this way, the name list we came up with might be erroneous. Gehrman Sparrow doesn't need a companion to frequently come to the cathedral to pray to gather information. He can change his appearance every day and enter to figure out the situation. This will be more indiscreet than using a companion.\"\nAs the largest and most holy Church of Evernight cathedral in Backlund, the number of believers that came to Saint Samuel Cathedral on a daily basis was too numerous to count. No bishop could remember every unfamiliar face that they once met.\n\"That also means that the names we have here are meaningless?\" Leonard raised his hand to rub his brows, sounding rather desultory.\n\"That's somewhat obvious. Our focus now should be on Gehrman Sparrow. The other targets can be placed aside as we perform the most basic level of surveillance.\" Having said that, Soest clapped and said, \"Alright, get busy.\"\nLeonard didn't have any objections. He happened to hope to find the Machinery Hivemind, Mandated Punishers, and MI9 to gather some information.\n...\nOn Tuesday morning, Klein woke up naturally, feeling relaxed and calm. He had the feeling of joyful emotions slowly coming to life.\nA Psychiatrist's Beyonder powers are quite useful after all... It really matches the extremely infectious optimism that Miss Justice brings with her...Klein got out of bed and drew the curtains.\nHe leisurely took in the scenery outside and the scattering golden sunlight. He regained his drive and began formulating his plans for the next couple months and even the year.\nFirst, get a new marionette.\nSecond, use the identity of Dwayne Dant\u00e8s and the control over a marionette to orchestrate scripts to expedite the digestion of the potion.\nThird, during this process, slowly gather the ingredients needed for the Bizarro Sorcerer potion. In that regard, I can ask Little Sun about the Bizarro Bane to see if he has any clues. I'll seek Mr. Azik's help regarding the Spirit World Plunderer. After all, the Underworld is part of the spirit world.\nFourth, I'll continue investigating the Great Smog of Backlund and find the true culprit. This includes Ince Zangwill, as well as the demigod that killed Crazy Captain. There aren't any targets more suitable than them for my advancement ritual. However, I have to be careful of 0-08. I have to constantly keep watch of any intentional coincidences... Hmm, I'll just dabble in the matter in an ordinary manner and mainly provide support. The dangerous investigations can be handed to Demoness Trissy.\nKlein's thought processes slowly became clear. Although he still felt worried and fearful, this no longer affected his mental state and capacity to take action.\nRetracting his gaze from outside the balcony, Klein walked into the bathroom and washed up.\nSoon, he opened the door while feeling highly spirited, and he saw his valet, Richardson, and butler, Walter, waiting outside.\nThe gentleman was wearing white gloves as he politely bowed and said, \"Good morning, sir. There's only one item on your schedule today. It's to join an event at the East Balam Military Veterans Mess with Member of Parliament Macht at three in the afternoon.\n\"He's a new member of parliament, so by accepting his invitation, it will also indicate your political inclinations. You still have the opportunity to be hesitant about it.\"\nKlein thought for a moment before saying, \"There's no need. It's my choice.\"\nHe paused and asked in an inquiring tone, \"It will be my first time visiting the East Balam Military Veterans Mess. What should I take note of?\"\n\"Praise their work that they have established in East Balam. Use this opportunity to make some donations. There's no need to give too much or little. 500 pounds is a rather suitable sum,\" Walter provided his opinion.\n500 pounds... Seriously, no matter which circle I enter, I'll have to spend large sums of money... Sigh, this is because Dwayne Dant\u00e8s doesn't have any birthright or background. He can only open a path with cash...Klein nodded gently and agreed with his butler's suggestion.\nAt the same time, he quickly did a count of his present assets.\nThe Artisan hasn't completed the work regarding the Ocean Songster, but the money for Mentor of Confusion and Druid has been obtained. That's a total of 16,000 pounds...\nWith the cash I originally had on hand, subtracting the 13,000 pounds I used to purchase 3% of the Coim Company's shares, as well as the daily expenses of a tycoon's household and the donations at the cathedral, there's still 23,985 pounds and 5 gold coins left...\nIn addition, I still owe Miss Messenger 3,413 gold coins...\n500 pounds has already exceeded 2% of the cash I have on hand...\nKlein didn't speak further as he walked out of his bedroom, going to the second floor where the dining room was in order to have his breakfast.\n...\nIn the basement of Saint Samuel Cathedral, Leonard Mitchell returned to his office earlier than his teammates.\nHe had already obtained the relevant information and had learned of an inconspicuous matter.\nPrince Edessak, who passed away in the Great Smog of Backlund, had once hired a private detective to investigate the death of equestrian teacher, Talim Dumont.\nAnd that private detective's name was: Sherlock Moriarty!\nAs expected! There are hints of him being involved with the Great Smog of Backlund!Leonard was delighted as he excitedly ruffled his hair.\nFollowing that, he pounded down at the documents on his desk with his fist, planning to seek out even more clues.\nHowever, he suddenly fell silent for about eight seconds before raising his cup in embarrassment and drank a mouthful of coffee. He mumbled inwardly,What did I want to do. I forgot about it after the pounding...\nAfter some careful recall, Leonard finally recalled what it was. He pulled out his drawer and took out a deck of tarot cards.\nThen, he found The Fool card and placed it on a piece of paper. On it, he wrote three names:\n\"Sherlock Moriarty, Gehrman Sparrow, Dwayne Dant\u00e8s.\"\nAfter some hesitation, Leonard drew a line linking the three names to The Fool card, indicating that they might very well be members of a secret organization that believed in The Fool.\nAmong them, he was most unsure of Gehrman Sparrow's identity as he wrote a question mark.\nLater, Leonard took out The Emperor card and stuck it beside the name, \"Sherlock Moriarty.\" He labeled it \"suspected to be.\"\nGehrman Sparrow and Dwayne Dant\u00e8s each correspond to a card?Leonard muttered silently. He took out the crazy adventurer's records and began reading them seriously.\nSuddenly, he found a date very familiar.\nEarly January!\nGehrman Sparrow's first appearance was in early January!\nNo way...Leonard drew a gasp as he flipped through another set of documents. At the end of it were the words:\n\"At the end of December, Sherlock Moriarty left Backlund and headed south for a vacation. He has yet to return.\"\nEnd of December... Early January... Backlund... Pritz Harbor... Gehrman Sparrow can change his appearance... No way?Leonard mumbled inwardly as he drew a dotted equality sign between \"Sherlock Moriarty\" and \"Gehrman Sparrow.\"\nThis great detective is the key...Leonard found Sherlock Moriarty's portrait that he had drawn via a ritual as he carefully looked at it.\nAfter considering the point that \"looks could be changed,\" he began imagining the detective in different disguises.\nAs he did it, Leonard's gaze froze bit by bit as he couldn't help but frown."}
{"num_chp":51,"summary":"Using magic to settle an IOU?\nIs he trying to curse his debtor to death or create counterfeit notes?\nI might not have a solution to the problem, but I can finish you instead?\n...\nAll sorts of thoughts appeared in Klein's mind as he looked at Old Neil with an oddly.\nHe seriously considered the possibility of calling the cops, no-of informing the Nighthawks.\nOld Neil shot a glance at him and said peeved, \"I can see ignorance, foolishness, and the weak and shameless disbelief in your eyes. Didn't Dunn tell you the maxim of the Mystery Pryers? Do as you wish but do no harm!\"\nAlthough this maxim originated from the secret and evil Moses Ascetic Order organization, Beyonders who choose the path of Moses Ascetic Order have proven that it's right through their own experiences. As long as one strictly abides to it and shows the needed fear and reverence, the risk of losing control will be minimized. The contrary has similarly been established.\n\"Your suspicion towards me is an insult to Mystery Pryers!\"\n\"Sorry.\" Klein did not hesitate to apologize.\nHe had indeed forgotten that Dunn Smith had once mentioned the maxim.\nOld Neil was not truly angry. In a blink of an eye, he chuckled.\n\"A pity. Very few Beyonders choose to be Seers. There is no corresponding maxim to help you.\"\nBut I have Emperor Roselle's diaries... Yes, strictly abiding to the maxim has a hint of \"acting...\"Klein suddenly came to this thought as he nodded as if in deep thought.\nOld Neil did not continue. He removed the vases and other items from the round table and placed them in a corner.\nImmediately following that, he took out both a crimson red and black candle from the silver chest. He explained, \"If ordinary people attempt ritualistic magic, they have to follow the results from astromancy or read corresponding manuals. They have to choose suitable dates and times. For example, the day representing the Goddess-the period when She rules over the moon. But for us Beyonders, especially Beyonders good in this domain, there's no need for that. Our acute spiritual perception and potent Astral Projections are key.\n\"Of course, if you are not confident about the ritualistic magic you are attempting, it's best to choose a suitable date and time. It can increase the probability of success.\n\"Ah right. This is based on a premise. Remember carefully to abide strictly by the rules!\"\nOld Neil placed two candles and turned to the side and looked at Klein, saying very solemnly, \"Low-Sequence Beyonders are not strong enough. Almost all the ritualistic magic they can perform are the seeking of external powers and help. Therefore, you can only consider orthodox divinities like the Goddess or the Lord of Storms. Absolutely- absolutely do not attempt to communicate with the unknown or unpredictable existences. Even if people believe in them or the promises recorded are filled with enticements!\n\"Believe me, don't take any chances. As long as you attempt once, you will go down a slippery slope into the abyss with no return. Any work or resistance will only slow it down with no way to change the trajectory.\"\n\"I'll remember!\" Klein said in a deep voice. However, he felt a little afraid.\nMy luck enhancement ritual has apparently sought power from an unknown and unpredictable existence...\nFurthermore, I have gained powers capable of pulling people into the fog that even a senior Beyonder like the Hanged Man finds unbelievable. Well... At least I think he is a senior Beyonder...\nThankfully, I haven't gone mad or have any signs of losing control...\nWhile worrying over this, he proactively changed the subject.\n\"So, Nighthawks should seek the help of the Goddess?\"\n\"No one will stop you if you pray to the Lord of Storms. However, we are unable to tell from our ritualistic magic whether He replies with malicious intent or not. The outcome will be distorted in unpredictable ways.\" Old Neil successfully made Klein give up the idea in a joking manner.\nThere was no so-called \"best,\" only \"necessary!\"\nAfter his exhortations, Old Neil picked up a crimson red candle and said, \"By using candles made of moon flowers and dark-red sandalwood, it will represent the Goddess's identity as Lady of Crimson in the ritualistic magic.\"\nHe pointed to the black candles and said, \"Candles made of night vanilla and slumber flowers represent the night.\"\nAs he spoke, he placed the black candle on the top left end of the round table while the red candle was placed on the top right end.\n\"Why do we symbolize the Goddess with only two candles? She is also the Mistress of Calm and Silence, Empress of Disaster and Horror, and Mistress of Calm and Silence.\"\nOld Neil chuckled.\n\"That's right. This is something I wished you asked.\n\"Before their fall, the Moses Ascetic Order had a very good relationship with the Church. Their beliefs and results on ritualistic magic have heavily influenced us.\n\"They believe that all objects are numeric. Every number has a spirituality and in ritualistic magic, 0 represents the unknown or Chaos. It symbolizes the state of the universe before it was born. 1 represents a beginning, the first Creator. 2 represents the world and various divinities that were produced from His body. 3 represents contact between divinities and material objects to create all things. Here, using two candles represents the Goddess while the third candle is for you.\n\"Which two candles and which two symbols to have depend on the intended effects the of ritualistic magic.\"\nThree begets all\u00a0things1? All things stem from three?Klein could not help but recall certain things from his previous life.\nSeeing Klein listen attentively, Old Neil took a third candle and said, \"This is the candle representing \u2018me.' It's a very ordinary candle which only has a little bit of mint added. Take note that plants like roses, lemons, mint, moon flower, night vanilla, and slumber flower are beloved and cherished by the Goddess.\n\"Viewing it from another angle, the three candles represent the bodies, spiritualities and godhood of every person.\"\nAfter finishing the description, Old Neil placed the third candle in the middle of the round table.\nHe then took out a bottle of concocted \"Full Moon Essence Oil,\" a huge cauldron engraved with the Dark Sacred Emblem, a silver knife with gorgeous patterns, a cup of water, and a saucer of coarse salt.\n\"To Beyonders who are not good at ritualistic magic, there is a need for bells, crystal balls, silver cups, incense or other supplementary items. However, Mystery Pryers and Seers have no need for that. These artifacts are already sufficient.\"\nOld Neil placed the fake goatskin parchment with the IOU just below the cauldron and used a special quill to hold down one corner.\nHe turned to Klein and said, \"Ritualistic magic needs a clean spiritual environment where you will not be disturbed. And that requires us to create it. The steps are to first enter Cogitation. Focus your mind and with the supplementary items, draw out our strength, and construct it around us. For example, Ray Bieber's house had used Holy Night Powder while I'll be using a ritual silver dagger.\n\"Throughout the entire process, we have to go according to the outcome we desire to confirm the symbolism and corresponding incantation. Incantations are best done in Hermes because ancient Hermes stemmed from Nature. It's akin to ancient Dragonish and ancient Elvish. The effects are very direct, lacking the necessary concealment and protection. It easily causes the caster to fall into danger. This is also why it has been modified. However, it's more effective.\n\"Alright, I have to focus on the ritualistic magic. I won't explain things to you any further. Pay attention by watching and listening. Remember any problems and ask me when everything is done.\"\n\"Alright.\" Klein took two steps back and trained his eyes on Old Neil.\nOld Neil's eyes rapidly darkened as invisible wind around him spun.\nHe was silent for a moment, going from left to right, then up to down, using his psyche to cause friction and consecutively light up the three candles.\nFollowing that, he picked up the silver knife and stabbed it into the coarse salt. Then, he chanted in Hermes:\n\"I sanctify you, blade of pure silver!\n\"I cleanse and purify you, allowing you to serve me in this ritual!\n...\n\"In the name of the Evernight Goddess, the Lady of Crimson...\n\"You have been sanctified!\"\nAfter a short but powerful syllable, Old Neil drew a silver knife and inserted it into a cup of clear water. Then, he raised it and pointed to the space beyond the round table.\nHe aimed the blade tip in the periphery and took a step forward, circling the round table. Every step he took made Klein feel an invisible energy spew out of the silver knife. It was filled with spirituality as it connected with the air, forming a completely sealed wall.\nAfter walking one round, the altar was completely isolated from its surroundings.\nOld Neil stood in front of the round table and put the silver knife down. He picked up the bottle of Full Moon Essence Oil and dripped three drops on the black, dark red, and ordinary candles.\nSizzle!\nA thin mist emanated as everything seemed to become veiled in mystery.\nOld Neil put down the glass bottle and looked at the fake goatskin parchment silently for two minutes. Then, he picked up the quill and drew a mark he controlled-a square that framed all the content, indicating that he was in control of the debt.\nFollowing that, he drew another \u2018cross,' indicating that it was canceled.\nUpon reaching this step, he picked up the parchment with one hand and tapped his glabella with the other to activate his Spirit Vision.\nAnother invisible and exuberant energy bloomed as Old Neil whispered a chant:\n\"I pray for the power of the dark night.\n\"I pray for the power of the crimson.\n\"I pray for the Goddess's loving grace.\n\"Please provide me with the funds to pay this IOU.\n\"Night vanilla, an herb that belongs to the red moon, please bestow your powers to my incantation!\"\n\"Moon flower, an herb that belongs to the red moon, please bestow your powers to my incantation!\"\n...\nKlein was completely flabbergasted listening from the side. All sorts of thoughts arose in him.\nSuch an incantation can work?\nAlthough it was recited from written Hermes...\nIsn't this way too simple and down to earth?\nWouldn't the Goddess be angry and multiply the debt severalfold?\nAt that moment, the candlelight lit up suddenly!\nAfter Old Neil finished his incantation, he closed his eyes for two minutes. He picked up the Full Moon Essence Oil and dripped one drop onto each of the three candles.\nImmediately following that, he grabbed the parchment and pulled it close to the candle representing \"me.\" When it ignited, he immediately threw it into the cauldron.\nOld Neil closed his eyes again as he seemed to sense the burning of the IOU.\nHe opened his eyes after a moment and looked toward the black Sacred Emblem on the cauldron. The parchment was already completely incinerated.\n\"Praise the Lady!\" Old Neil tapped his chest in four spots, forming the shape of the crimson moon. Then, he extinguished the candles in the opposite order as he lit them.\nAfter finishing everything, he used the silver knife to rip apart the invisible wall around him.\nA huge wind stirred immediately as Old Neil heaved a sigh of relief.\n\"It's done.\"\n\"That's it?\" Klein asked in a daze. \"Has the IOU been settled? How?\"\n\"I don't know either. Anyways, it will be settled in a reasonable manner,\" said Old Neil with a smile as he threw up his hands.\nThis...Klein was unsure what expression or words to use as a response.\nIsn't this a little unreliable?"}
{"num_chp":1066,"summary":"Upon hearing Miss Justice's suggestion, Klein thought for a moment and said, \"Guide the dream towards matters encompassing the Second Epoch's history, the Queen of Calamity Cohinem, elf habits, and the most ancient language of the elves, as well as the legendary Western Continent.\"\n\"...Alright.\" Audrey's eyes moved slightly, revealing a thoughtful expression as she digested the information that Mr. World had said.\nThen, she walked to the Elven Songster's side.\nUnder her guidance, Mobet's figure in the garden rapidly blurred as he vanished from Siatas's dream.\nThe ripples in Audrey's green eyes stirred once again as her lips quivered, as though she was reciting something.\nNas\nThe entire dream world began to shake as the garden was like a reflection of a lake that was smashed into pieces by an invisible stone that flew over from nowhere.\nThese fragments quickly gathered, but the scene that was restored was no longer a garden, but that of a palace made of coral.\nEvery detail in the palace was abnormally gorgeous. The entire structure was tall and majestic, but due to the layers of blue seawater, the sky couldn't be seen, making it appear dark and gloomy.\nInside it, coral pillars propped up an exaggerated dome, and the walls and the top of it were filled with terrifying murals of the storm.\nAbove the murals and corals, silver bolts of lightning followed a certain trajectory as if they were alive. Finally, they converged at the nine steps that were inlaid with pearls, diamonds, emerald, and turquoise.\nSiatas was standing there, with many elves standing opposite her.\nOn the nine steps, there were two huge chairs that seemed to be formed purely of lightning. One of them occupied the center, just like the ruler of this palace. One of them was on its left, appearing less eye-catching.\nSitting on the throne in the middle was a man wearing a simple loose robe. His ears were pointed, and his facial features were rather soft and his hair thick. His hair was a mix of black and blue colors. Not only did his facial features look outstanding on their own, they combined together to form an even more handsome face. However, he directly gave one a tyrannous impression, as though he wouldn't say a word before picking up the electric spear leaning on his armrest, and then throwing it.\nSitting beside him was a beautiful woman with raven-black hair. Her hair was tied up into a high bun, her ears slightly pointed, and her facial features delicate. She had dark brown eyes that were as deep as the ocean, and in her hands, she was playing with a complicated golden wine cup.\nWithout needing Siatas's introduction, Klein and company could easily determine that this couple was the Elf King, the ancient god, Soniathrym, and the Elf Queen, Queen of Calamity, Cohinem.\n\"That traitor, Aurmir!\" Suddenly, a voice resembling loud thunder boomed, causing the entire palace to shake violently. It made Siatas and the other attendants lower their heads in fear.\nThis roar came from the ancient god.\nAurmir, isn't that the name of the Giant King? I've recently been drinking red wine named after him. I have to say that its quality is indeed higher than anything else. It's just a little expensive... As Klein listened, he had a random thought.\nHe remembered that Little Sun had once said that Giant King Aurmir, Elf King Soniathrym, and Sanguine Ancestor Lilith-the three humanoid ancient gods-were allies. They fought against the opposing camp formed by Dragon of Imagination, Ankewelt; Phoenix Ancestor, Gregrace; and the Mutant King, Kvastir. As for the Devil Monarch, Farbauti, and the Annihilation Demonic Wolf, Flegrea, they were independent beings who wanted to subvert all order and corrupt all living beings.\nSo, the alliance of three humanoid ancient gods eventually collapsed? Klein reined in his thoughts and waited for the subsequent changes in the dream.\nDue to Derrick's existence, Audrey wasn't unfamiliar with the history of the Second Epoch. Without any hesitation, she directly made Siatas's dream continue its development.\nDespite the terrifying roar, Queen of Calamity Cohinem wasn't affected at all. With a cold expression, \"She\" calmly said, \"Wasn't this already long confirmed?\n\"His' reputation is exactly the opposite of \u2018His' physical build.\".\nAt that moment, the ancient god, Soniathrym, had already been enveloped by bolts of lightning. \"He\" said in a thunderous voice, \"I thought that, after centuries, \u2018He' would understand the global situation even more. I've overestimated \u2018His' intelligence!\n\"If \u2018He' didn't sell out Lilith back then, how could \u2018She' have perished?\"\nEh... The Sanguine Ancestor Lilith perished so early? Klein's eyelids twitched as he quickly focused his attention.\nAfter the Elf King finished roaring, Queen of Calamity Cohinem maintained \"Her\" previous posture and said, \"That's not a bad thing. At the very least, Kvastir and Flegrea were dragged to the grave together with Lilith. All the deities no longer trust each other. Even if we don't form an alliance, we can rule the ocean, lakes, and rivers.\"\nUpon hearing these words, Spectator Audrey, couldn't help but feel alarmed. She had no choice but to use Placate on herself.\nThis... It means that the Sanguine Ancestor Lilith, Mutant King Kvastir, and the Annihilation Demonic Wolf Flegrea perished in a battle between ancient gods. So the betrayal of Giant King Aurmir and the other ancient gods had nothing to do with the ancient sun god?\nThis is why Lilith didn't fully die and is still able to occasionally deliver divine revelations? And because of this, the Antigonus Mother of the Sky and Hornacis mountain range managed to survive to the Fourth Epoch... Klein increasingly believed that the history recorded in the City of Silver had many fabrications or vague records. Thankfully, he hadn't completely digested the Bizarro Sorcerer potion and didn't need to consider advancing to Scholar of Yore. Otherwise, the \"history\" he used might not be real.\nIn ancient times, the Sanguine Ancestor Lilith and Mutant King Kvastir perished due to the other... The Sanguine has recently been working with the Mutant's temperance faction. Time sure is a great magician... Heh heh, if The Moon Emlyn were to know of this, I wonder what kind of expression he would have... The Star Leonard sighed as he thought.\nAs their thoughts raced, the ancient god, Soniathrym, scoffed and said, \"Recently, Aurmir wanted to work with some secret sects that have sprouted from the humans to deal with us. Apparently, this matter is led by Harvest and Dawn.\n\"I'm even thinking of working with Ankewelt to destroy the giants and the Giant King's Court. Unfortunately, every time I see that dragon, I have the urge to string it up on a grill. It's a type of attraction that's simply irresistible!\"\nJust as he said that, the ancient god suddenly vanished. The entire palace shook violently, causing a rift to appear.\nAll of this had yet to subside when a bolt of lightning flashed. Soniathrym returned to the massive throne, holding a spear made of pure lightning\n\"You went to the Giant King's Court?\" Cohinem asked.\n\"I taught Aurmir a lesson,\" Soniathrym answered without hiding anything.\nSiatas and the other elven attendants lowered their heads even further. They faintly saw slippery tentacles that were thicker than their bodies flipping about on the ground, flashing with silver bolts of lightning.\nThen, they shut their eyes.\nThe dream changed as Siatas \"recalled\" her interaction with other elves.\nWith their conversations and interactions, Klein, Leonard, and Audrey learned that Siatas lived in a relatively peaceful time period in the Second Epoch. The giants, elves, dragons, devils, and phoenixes coexisted, splitting up their rule over the Northern and Southern Continent, as well as the Five Seas. Vampires, demonic wolves, treants, sea monsters, mutants, and humans were vassals of the different factions, occupying the lower-middle classes.\n\"This doesn't resemble the history recorded by the Church. Even the legends in the City of Silver aren't like this.\" Leonard sighed when he heard that. \"Old Man probably doesn't know this much.\"\n\"That isn't necessarily true.\" Klein shook his head indiscernibly. \"Many existences in the Second Epoch have survived to the Fourth Epoch, or even to this very moment.\"\n\"For example the Wisdom Angel?\" Leonard asked with a guess.\n\"Perhaps.\" Klein didn't give an affirmative answer as he said with a smile, \"When you were talking to Mobet, I thought you would make Miss Justice stand further away.\"\nLeonard immediately shot a glance at him and yawned.\n\"You mentioned before that there's an existence behind me that might've been seen the second Blasphemy Slate. Then, when I was conversing with Mobet Zoroast, wouldn't she be able to make the connection from me getting her to stand further away?\n\"Besides, you also mentioned that back when dealing with all of Amon's avatars in Backlund, part of the clean-up operation involved Miss Justice. To a Sequence 5 Spectator, what she knows is sufficient. Once she understands the Zoroast family's matters, the truth is practically in front of her eyes. In that case, why waste time trying to avoid her. It's too troublesome. I might as well get Mr. Fool to be a witness as everyone vows not to divulge each other's secrets.\"\nKlein nodded slightly and said, \"If you were to get Miss Justice to stand further away, it wouldn't be easy for you to bring up the matter of making a vow to keep things a secret...\"\nAt this moment, Siatas continued, \"After the death of the Sanguine Ancestor, the Annihilation Demonic Wolf, and the Mutant King, some of \u2018Their' subsidiary gods were killed, while others surrendered to other ancient gods. There were a few who vanished as they hid in the shadows.\"\nHaving \"transformed\" herself into an elf, Audrey immediately asked, \"Who surrendered to who? Who died?\"\nSiatas recalled and said, \"I've never even seen it before. Uh, the Sanguine's Goddess of Life and the Mutant King's God of War were killed. No one even remembers \u2018Their names... The Annihilation Demonic Wolf's God of the Dead, Salinger, came under the Phoenix Ancestor. The Sanguine's Goddess of Beauty, Auernia, came under us... The Mutant King's God of Spiritual Creatures, Tolzna, and Annihilation Demonic Wolf's Goddess of Misfortune, Amanises, vanished...\"\nSalinger... Auernia... These two names made Klein's forehead twitch. He instinctively used his Clown powers to maintain his facial expression.\nAuernia was the Blood Moon Queen, the wife of the Fourth Epoch's Emperor, the Empress of the Trunsoest Empire!\nAs for Salinger, \"He\" was the founder of the Balam Empire, the Emperor of the Underworld \u2013 Death!"}
{"num_chp":1247,"summary":"Mysteries... Klein's heart palpitated when he heard that. He subconsciously wanted to return to Sefirah Castle and leave the scene.\nHowever, no matter how much he tried, his Spirit Body remained inside his body without any changes.\nMan... This vexed Klein. He instinctively cast his gaze towards Reinette Tinekerr who was beside him. He saw that Miss Messenger had already floated over, looking like \"She\" was facing a terrifying enemy. And the surrounding darkness froze like a cold lake. Lightning stopped streaking across the sky.\nMysteries... Klein felt a slight sense of security as he thought back to the title he had just heard.\nHe was no stranger to that. However, the last person who addressed him in this manner was the ancient sun god-the City of Silver's Creator-from two thousand years ago. Before \"He\" died, \"He\" sensed Klein's divination and shouted this out through an insurmountable distance of space and time!\nNo way... The True Creator is equivalent to the ancient sun god? No, \"He\" is only a Sequence 0 true god, far from the level of the Creator that I assumed. Furthermore, from Amon's attitude, the ancient sun god must have really perished... The True Creator is the pitch-black infant that emerged from the ancient sun god's stomach and inherited some of the ancient sun god's characteristics and memories. \"He\" is the degenerated body of that Creator? Klein composed himself and attempted to rapidly think of a solution to his present conundrum.\nAt this moment, in the cloak formed by the \"curtain,\" the dark whirlpool made another sound:\n\"Go to the Giant King's Court and meet Sasrir.\"\nThis sentence directly reverberated in Klein's mind. Then, in the form of an illusory word, it shrunk into a pitch-black membrane, forming a strange \"seed.\"\nThe \"seed\" immediately fell into his body and Spirit Body, melting inside.\nWithout waiting for a response, the dark whirlpool dissipated. The cloak formed by the \"curtain\" lost its support and fell back onto the ground.\nThe True Creator's consciousness that descended had corroded a portion of my Spirit Body and some of my physical body. I'm compelled to go to the Giant King's Court and open the slumbering Dark Angel Sasrir's palace... This is a matter that many deities are paying attention to. After watching for a long time, the True Creator has finally found an opportunity to force me to do it... Klein looked around and summoned his past self, picking up the \"curtain.\"\nThen, he said to Miss Messenger without hesitation, \"Let's leave immediately!\"\nThe True Creator had already sent a sliver of \"His\" will over. Would Amon still be far away?\nIn addition, Klein also tried to seize the opportunity to enter the world above the gray fog, hoping to use the power of Sefirah Castle to remove the corrosive influences that plagued him.\n\"Alright.\" Reinette Tinekerr nodded, allowing the numerous Beyonder characteristics left behind in the crater to fly over and be contained within \"Her.\"\nAccording to their prior agreement, other than the spoils of war that involved the high Sequences of the Seer pathway, half of them would go to \"Her,\" with \"Her\" having the priority to choose. After all, Klein had also received some of the spoils back when dealing with Shaman King Klarman.\nAs for the remaining half of the spoils, Klein planned on offering it to the Evernight Goddess as a form of gratitude. Regardless of whether the deity needed it or not, he still needed to do the necessary procedures. He had to express his gratitude when needed.\nAfter clearing the battlefield, Reinette Tinekerr entered the iron cigar case in Klein's pocket and \"possessed\" the gold coin's surface.\nKlein didn't immediately seal \"Her.\" Holding the Staff of the Stars, he conjured a scene in his mind.\nThat was one of the scenes he had memorized during his inspection of the terrain.\nAs the gems flashed, his figure disappeared from the crater as he teleported far away.\nA few seconds later, the air there fluctuated as a tiny creature that was difficult to see with the naked eye crawled out.\nThe creature rapidly expanded, turning into Amon who wore a pointed hat and classic black robe.\nThe corners of Amon's mouth curled up as \"He\" adjusted the monocle on \"His\" right eye and chuckled.\n\"Someone is finally opening that door.\"\n...\nAfter two rounds of teleportation, Klein took out the iron cigar case that Miss Messenger was hiding in, and used the Staff of the Stars to create several layers of seals-the kind that would be removed the moment he touched it.\nRight on the heels of that, he entered the fog of history and dashed all the way to a time before the First Epoch. He relied on the prayers he had yet to reply to and instantly entered the world above the gray fog through the summoning of Sefirah Castle.\nAs the roars and the ravings echoed, he felt the corrosion in his Spirit Body gather together, curling into a ball. Despite passing through layers of cleansing effects, it managed to maintain its stability and didn't completely evaporate.\nIs this the power and level of a true deity? Yes, and it's a true deity who wields the domain of degeneration... Sitting in the seat belonging to The Fool, Klein frowned slightly as he observed his state.\nThe corrosion created by the True Creator wasn't strong. If they were to leave the protection of Klein's Spirit Body, they wouldn't be able to last long above the gray fog. This was also the main reason why he had made the judgment and dared to directly enter Sefirah Castle.\nHowever, unless he planned on dying again, there was no way he could bypass his own Spirit Body to remove the corrosion.\nWith the help of divination and other abilities, Klein quickly figured out the various effects of the corrosion.\nIt wouldn't mutate, send a message to the True Creator, or interfere with what he did. It would only continue to steer him via mystic means towards the Giant King's Court. It compelled Klein to open the palace where Dark Angel Sasrir was in deep sleep.\nIt's partly in the mind, and also at the level of fate... When I become a Miracle Invoker and become an angel, deepening my control of Sefirah Castle, I should be able to clear this \"corruption\"... However, if I want to become a Miracle Invoker and become an angel, I have to go to the Giant King's Court and open the door to that palace, helping the City of Silver find a way to leave the Forsaken Land of the Gods... As Klein thought, he revealed a wry smile.\nFortunately, this was something he was prepared to do, and it didn't burden him further.\nFollowing that, Klein summoned the Unshadowed Crucifix from the fog of history, attempting to use the power of Sefirah Castle to drive it into purifying his body. Unfortunately, part of his body was also merged together with the corrosion, preventing him from completely cleansing it.\nThis also made him truly understand how terrifying Sequence 0 was.\nI can't just pray to an evil god like the True Creator unless I'm in a hopeless situation... Klein shook his head and returned to the real world before sacrificing the \"curtain\" above the gray fog.\nIt does indeed contain the Beyonder characteristic of an Attendant of Mysteries, as well as a Miracle Invoker's Beyonder characteristic... There's even Scholar of Yore and Bizarro Sorcerer characteristics... It has a rather high level. The power I can use from Sefirah Castle at present isn't able to directly shatter it. However, this place seems to be at the highest level of the Seer pathway, so it can effectively suppress it. Through the accumulation of time, I should be able to slowly separate it...\nThe first to be separated should be the Attendant of Mysteries characteristic. The rest can be used to concoct a potion directly... Hmm, it doesn't have any living characteristics. The one that was summoned just now has already disappeared... With the translucent black velvet curtain in hand, he looked at it for a while.\nThen, he activated Sefirah Castle and conjured a metal pot which was boiling with invisible power.\nAfter staring at it for a few seconds, he threw the \"curtain\" into the \"metal pot\" and pressed down with layers of seals onto the pot's lid.\nIn about three to four days, the Attendant of Mysteries Beyonder characteristic would separate. The supplementary ingredients could be thrown into what remained, and it would then be a Miracle Invoker potion, one that included the characteristics from Sequence 9 to 2.\nLooking around, he raised his right hand and took a piece of paper from the junk pile.\nThis was one of his other preparations.\nHe had spent a large amount of time in advance and had failed time and time again to successfully summon 0-08. Using this quill, he wrote down what reasonable reactions Dark Demonic Wolf would have. This was to prevent the other party from reacting in unexpected ways from the very beginning, causing his plans to fail.\nWith the cooperation of this short script, the Dark Demonic Wolf had been attracted by Klein's strange behavior. Therefore, it was very reasonable that \"He\" didn't extinguish the prayer light immediately.\nSimilarly, without knowing how many enemies or what strength the other party had, the Dark Demonic Wolf didn't flee in a hurry. Instead, \"He\" created a complete independent \"kingdom,\" isolating it from any possible reinforcements. It was a very reasonable reaction.\nWith a flick of his wrist, Klein burned the piece of paper, then he hurriedly sacrificed the sealed iron cigar case to Sefirah Castle. He then responded to Miss Magician's prayer and relayed The World's message.\nFors didn't dare to delay any further. She immediately got up and used her \"Recording\" Beyonder powers to grab at the area ahead, dragging out Gehrman Sparrow from history.\nWith that, Klein \"Teleported\" to the empty room in a nearby hotel. He set up a ritual and brought the iron cigar case back to reality, releasing Reinette Tinekerr.\nAfter thanking Miss Messenger and watching \"Her\" take away half of the Beyonder characteristics, he changed the ritual and began to perform a sacrifice to the Evernight Goddess.\nAt the end of the ritual, he prayed with anticipation:\n\"I pray for a hint on how to purify the corrosive influences in my body.\"\nIn his opinion, at present, only an existence at the level of the Evernight Goddess could deal with the corrosion provided by the True Creator.\nIf the Goddess agreed to it, Klein planned to descend in a way that would allow his actual spirit to return to Backlund and receive purification.\nAs for removing the part of his body that had been corroded, he hadn't thought of a solution yet.\nAs he said that, a ball of darkness enveloped the altar.\nWhen the darkness vanished, all the Beyonder characteristics disappeared.\nApart from that, there were no other hints.\n...It looks like I can only rely on myself... Klein wasn't depressed. He raised his right hand and tapped his chest four times, drawing the crimson moon.\n\"Praise the Lady!\"\nHis gratitude was very sincere. After all, he had received a lot of help.\nAfter dealing with the subsequent matters, his historical projection vanished and he returned to the Forsaken Land of the Gods in person.\nHe held the lantern he had pulled out from the past, and he looked at the silent and desolate plains under the dim yellow light. He felt much more relaxed and couldn't help but sigh.\nFinally..."}
{"num_chp":373,"summary":"Old Kohler seemed to be a slightly afraid of her ferocity as he subconsciously took a step back.\n\"Liv, this is a detective, and he w-wishes to help you find Daisy.\"\nLiv's wrinkled, peeling face turned to Klein and said coldly, \"We've already made a police report.\"\nAlthough she was perhaps in her thirties, she looked to be in her fifties.\nKlein looked around the room where many wet clothes hung. He vaguely remembered the last time he was here. There had been a thirteen or fourteen-year-old girl, carefully holding a crude homemade iron to iron the clothes which had wrinkled from being hung to dry. Her hands had been covered with burns.\nShe's the \"missing\" Daisy...Klein looked back at the laundry maid, Liv, and said in a neutral tone, \"Do you believe that the East Borough police will really be looking for Daisy?\n\"Are you sure the people who caused Daisy to go \u2018missing' wouldn't cast their sights on your family?\n\"Do you wish to lose another daughter after losing one?\"\nWhen the cruel yet heart-wrenching words reached Liv's ears, the indifferent expression on her face slowly crumbled. She turned agape, but she couldn't say anything. The corners of her eyes gradually turned red.\nShe abruptly lowered her head and muttered to herself in pain and despair, \"I don't have any money...\"\nThe room suddenly became silent. Even the sobbing girl didn't make another sound.\nKlein pursed his lips and let out a silent sigh.\n\"I occasionally do volunteer work, simply to help others. Heh heh, I haven't done so in a long time, so please give me a chance.\"\n\"Volunteer work?\" Liv lifted her head and ruminated over the phrase.\nKlein nodded slightly and answered, \"The job will be done pro bono. No, it is not completely free either. Kindness will bring me great satisfaction.\n\"Since you have no other solutions, why not give it a try?\"\nLiv was silent for a moment. She raised her hand, which had wrinkled from being soaked in water for an extended period of time, wiped her eyes, and said in a low voice, \"Mr. Detective, you... you really are a kind and good gentleman...\"\nHer voice suddenly became choked with sobs.\n\"... This was what happened-at midday before yesterday, at noon, Daisy delivered a load of washed laundry under Freja's lead. It was just outside East Borough, and they needed to cross several streets.\n\"In order to rush back for lunch, Freja had chosen a secluded alley, but a momentary distraction left her realizing that Daisy, who had been following her, was gone.\n\"She retraced her route but never found Daisy, and Daisy hasn't come back yet.\n\"Where did this happen, Freja?\"\nThe girl named Freja had already stood up, her eyes were red and puffy.\nShe sobbed and said, \"Right here, right here in Broken Axe Lane, Mister Detective. Will Daisy be alright?\"\n\"Probably,\" Klein replied without much of an expression.\nHe looked around and asked, \"Do you have anything that Daisy often carries? I can borrow a police dog. It has an excellent sense of smell and can be used to find a person based on the lingering scent.\"\n\"... No,\" Liv thought for a moment and said with a sad expression.\nFreja once again shed tears. She felt as if the situation had turned into one of despair once again.\nSuddenly, she blinked and said, \"Wait, there's something.\n\"Daisy's vocabulary book!\"\n\"Vocabulary book?\" Old Kohler asked.\nLiv sniffed and said, \"I make Freja and Daisy attend the free school at night. I can keep washing clothes, but they can't always be doing the same.\"\nThis lady is such a good mother...Klein couldn't help but sigh.\nThe free classes offered at night were set up by the three major Churches or some charity organizations. From eight to ten o'clock in the evening, the school would be free of charge and would even provide stationery and a certain amount of paper. It was an education that was need-blind, and it would at most involve some religious knowledge. Klein had heard Old Neil mention that he had once been a teacher for the Church of the Evernight Goddess for several years.\nBecause there were very few people who volunteered to be teachers in the free school, a unique teaching method was established. Teachers would arrive early, gather the few students who had the best academic progress, imbue them with the content for that day's class, and then put them in charge of teaching the different classes. The teachers would supervise, correcting any mistakes. It was called a \"tutorial system.\"\nCorresponding to the free classes were the free organizations such as the technical workers' workshop, which were truly accessible to the poor, and one of the few outlets to escape from poverty.\nUnfortunately, there were too few similar organizations, and it was difficult for them to play a substantial role.\nAt this moment, the sobbing Freja added, \"Daisy liked studying very much. She was made the tutor of her class by her teacher. She would put together the vocabulary words she had copied and hugged them in her bed every day. She would wake up early and go out into the street to recite them under the light of dawn. She's always found it regretful that there are no street lamps around here...\"\nAs she spoke, Freja rushed back to the bunk bed and took out a stack of crumpled paper from under the tattered pillow.\nDue to it being in a humid environment for extended periods of time, the words that were copied on it had already smudged.\nThe edges of the sheets of paper were worn out, as though they had been turned over and over by someone for a long time.\n\"Mister Detective, i-is this okay?\" Freja handed Klein the so-called vocabulary book, which had no binding at all, and anxiously asked.\n\"Yes,\" Klein answered very simply.\nHe wasn't trying to comfort Freja. Although it wasn't the kind of items Daisy carried around all the time, it was something that had accompanied her all this while. Moreover, it had been projected with Daisy's strong will. It was excellent for using it as dowsing to seek her out.\nHe casually flipped through the vocabulary book and said, \"Then I'll start taking action. The earlier I find Daisy, the better.\"\nLiv and Freja were unable to find words to describe their feelings. All they could do was watch as Klein and Old Kohler leave, repeating the words \"thank you,\" \"thank you, Mr. Detective,\" and \"thank you, good gentleman.\"\nAfter leaving the apartment, Klein turned to Old Kohler and said, \"You should pay attention to those female textile workers who lost their jobs, especially those who have neither found new jobs nor become street girls, and pay more attention to those who have gone off to unknown places...\n\"Pay attention to your own safety. Ask less and listen more. If you do this well, you'll get a bonus.\"\n\"Alright!\" Old Kohler nodded heavily.\nHe didn't immediately bid farewell. After hesitating for a moment, he asked with a tone full of expectation, \"You'll find Daisy, won't you, Mister Detective?\"\n\"I can only say that I will do my best.\" Klein didn't make any guarantees.\nOld Kohler sighed and smiled bitterly.\n\"I've lost my child, so I'm very unwilling to see this sort of thing happen...\"\nHe waved his hand and walked towards another street.\nKlein left the area at a leisurely pace, wrapping Daisy's \"vocabulary book\" around the head of the cane and, without attracting any attention, completed a \"Dowsing Rod Seeking.\"\nThere are results. Towards the northwest... For the time being, It's not possible to confirm if I'm suffering any interference or misdirection...He looked down at the direction in which the cane was going to fall and put out his palm to steady it.\nAccording to the revelation, Klein went all the way out of East Borough and hired a rental carriage.\nHalf an hour later, the carriage, which occasionally changed directions, stopped at Iris Street, near Cherwood Borough and West Borough. It stopped in front of a house with a vast lawn, a wide garden, a small fountain square, and a marble statue.\nAt this moment, Klein's cane had fallen down inside the carriage and was aimed straight at that direction!\nThrough the window, Klein could see the guards patrolling inside the gates and ferocious dogs with their tongues out.\nThe security inside was quite tight.\nMore importantly, even without using divination, his spiritual intuition made him sense that there was great danger hidden within!\nWhat is this place? How can Daisy's disappearance involve such a dangerous place?Klein thought for a few seconds, then he told the carriage driver to keep going.\nThe carriage driver replied with some surprise, \"Sir, are you not here to visit Mr. Capim?\"\nCapim?The name sounded extremely familiar to Klein.\nHe smiled and asked, \"Why do you think so?\"\n\"There will always be people coming out from East Borough who ride in my carriage all the way here. Heh heh, this is the home of the rich and powerful Mr. Capim,\" the carriage driver casually replied.\nEast Borough... Capim... Tycoon...Klein suddenly remembered who Capim was.\nThere were many rumors that he was the leader of a bloody criminal organization which was stained with blood. He was involved in the disappearance of many innocent girls!\nAnd in reality, he was a tycoon who knew quite a few important figures.\nWithout another word, Klein leaned back against the wall and half-closed his eyes.\nThe horse carriage slowly moved forward. The luxurious villa was left behind as it disappeared from the window.\n...\nIn a small booth in a coffee shop.\nFors already knew that the old man across her was called Lawrence Nord, who came from Midseashire's Constant City and was a public school teacher.\nHe didn't know that Mrs. Aulisa's husband was dead, nor that Mrs. Aulisa had inherited his estate and become a Beyonder, much less know that Mrs. Aulisa had left me her relics... Could he also be a Beyonder? Does he have the ability to divine?After taking a sip of Fermo coffee, she organized her words and said, \"I was a doctor at the nearby Yosifov Clinic, and Mrs. Aulisa came to see me often. That was when her husband, Mr. Laubero had already passed away...\n\"... Sometimes I would accompany her by chatting with her and helping her do things like...\n\"So in the end, she made a will, giving me her savings and cash. She donated jewelry, books, furniture, and other things to a charity. This was done under the supervision of her assigned law firm.\"\nFors was telling the truth, but not the whole truth.\nLawrence pinched his forehead and said, \"What a pity. I don't understand why Aulisa didn't contact me over all those years.\"\n\"She didn't mention your name. She was vaguely dissatisfied with Mr. Laubero's family,\" Fors replied frankly.\nLawrence fell silent for a moment before saying, \"Thank you for informing me. It has made me understand certain things.\"\n\"By the way, where are Laubero and Aulisa buried?\"\n\"Grimm Cemetery.\" Fors took out a pocket watch and gave it a look before saying, \"Mr. Lawrence, I still have things to tend to. I should be leaving.\"\nLawrence didn't stop her. He got up and saw her off.\nAfter sitting down again, he rubbed his temples in distress and silently muttered to himself,Laubero is dead, and he didn't leave any children behind, and I don't know what Aulisa did to his Beyonder characteristic... Richard died at the hands of the Aurora Order... Sam doesn't even wish to contact us at all, having no interest in shouldering the responsibility of the family name...\nWill the Abraham family slowly disappear like this?"}
{"num_chp":573,"summary":"In a forest in Blue Mountain Island where the Resistance base was located.\nSitting in a wheelchair, Kalat raised his bald head and looked towards the sunlight that was scattering at the cave's entrance. His eyes couldn't hide his joy.\nHe acutely sensed that ever since God reappeared over the land and stated \"His\" ten commandments, the previous bloodshed and chaos had changed. From time to time, \"He\" would provide them with guidance which was filled with wisdom. Furthermore, \"He\" would observe all creatures and proactively interfere with the situation at sea in a bid to help the Resistance and everyone in Rorsted, allowing them to pass through a difficult, thorny path while still being able to see some hope.\nPerhaps this is the true meaning behind \"His\" reappearance over the land...Kalat recalled the revelation he had just received and guessed that the red-haired woman named Helene was like a fulcrum for Vice Admiral Ailment Tracy and the forces out at sea. She was the key to spoiling the balance between the countries, and only by making the world's situation more chaotic would the people of Rorsted receive the opportunity of being liberated!\nKalat drew in a breath and quickly set up a ritual to pray to Sea God, conjuring Helene's picture.\nAfter doing all of this, he instinctively turned his head to the side and wore a somewhat mixed expression.\nLiving in that direction was the high priest of the Church of Sea God, a priest who was a high-ranking member of the Resistance.\nAlthough they don't dare go against the revelations and have made tremendous changes, in many ways, they're still immersed in the past.

If this goes on, they'll one day be abandoned by God...Kalat couldn't hide the smile in his heart while he felt a strong sense of anguish.\n...\nAfter scanning through all the believers' prayers and picking a few to respond to, Klein returned to the real world. He planned on heading out to search for a chance to enact true acting.\nWhen his right hand gripped the door handle, a ridiculous but possible thought came to his mind.\nMy true goal is not to find red-haired Helene, but to use this opportunity to get to Vice Admiral Ailment Tracy and figure out what happened to tycoon Jimmy Necker, so as to get to know the location of the ancient chronicles of Death.\nThat is to say, I only need to lure Vice Admiral Ailment Tracy out with red-haired Helene. As for whether she's the real person or not, that doesn't matter.\nI can make myself red-haired Helene and let Danitz send me to Strongman Ozil, get the reward, and easily meet Vice Admiral Ailment Tracy.\nWhat an impressive sequence of actions...\nKlein suddenly shook his head as he found a reason to reject the idea.\nAlthough I'm a Faceless, I can't accept wearing drag!\n... Could it be that overcoming my inner resistance is also one of the principles for acting?\nFurthermore, I don't know red-haired Helene. Acting as her wouldn't work. I would just be like her on the surface, and I wouldn't be able to fool people who are familiar with her. That way, I won't be able to meet Vice Admiral Ailment Tracy.\nYes. The person searching for red-haired Helene might not be Tracy, but an enemy of hers.\nI don't know Vice Admiral Ailment Tracy's background. Rashly doing such an act would result in immeasurable danger.\nIt's best to be safe and abide by my wishes. I'll first search for red-haired Helene, and after determining the details, I can consider the subsequent actions.\nAt that moment, Klein suddenly felt that something was amiss in the living room. Danitz's snoring had softened, and the time between each snore shortened.\nVice Admiral Iceberg is here?Klein turned the handle and opened the door to the bedroom.\nWhile making this silent action, Danitz sat up with his eyes open.\nHe tried hard to hide his smile as he said, \"Captain came.\n\"She said that Admiral of Blood's crew was sighted at Longtail Island and is continuing south. His destination seems to be the Berserk Sea.\n\"The source of the news is trustworthy!\"\nLongtail Island? The island at the southern end of the Rorsted Sea?

He circled around the area and headed straight for the Berserk Sea... Yes, it's probably because his intelligence officer, Old Quinn, didn't send a telegram to inform him...Klein felt pangs of regret and could only lament how reality changed faster than his plans.\nHe had planned to make his hunt of Admiral of Blood become the crowning battle of the crazy adventurer and bounty hunter, Gehrman Sparrow.\nKilling a single Steel Maveti ultimately lacks that shock and awe effect...Klein didn't say a word as he calmly looked at Danitz.\nDanitz felt a little uneasy from the intent stare as he gave a hollow chuckle.\n\"Admiral of Blood has fled. Your cooperation with Captain has come to an end, right?\n\"I can now return to the Golden Dream, right?\n\"Further developments can be done via your messenger!\"\nKlein pondered for a moment and took out a piece of paper from his pocket. He scribbled the method to summon his messenger.\nFollowing that, he flicked his wrist, sending the piece of paper out like a metallic plate.\nDanitz was a Hunter at Sequence 9, so he easily reached out and caught the piece of paper.\nHe scanned it before a scarlet flame rose in his palms, burning the paper to ashes.\n\"Haha, even if I forget it, Captain will have a way of making me recall it.\"\nHe paused and squeezed out a smile before asking again, \"I can now return to the Golden Dream, right?\"\nKlein nodded slightly and said, \"Yes.\"\nI... I can!Danitz held back his urge to pump his fist in celebration, afraid that he would end up antagonizing the madman, Gehrman Sparrow.\nHe smiled cautiously and said, \"I'll first pay off the room for this period of time and buy a ship ticket. As you know, Bayam hasn't been calm recently. Captain doesn't wish for the Golden Dream to dock at the harbor here.\"\nAt least you know how to settle the room's payment...Klein didn't say a word as he maintained his austere attitude. He draped himself with a coat and took his hat before walking towards his luxurious suite.\nWhen his back disappeared into the corner of a staircase and vanished from Danitz's sight, Danitz shrank back into his room and clenched his fist, pumping them into the air.\n\"Wonderful! Wonderful!\n\"I'm finally free!\"\nHe didn't delay in wearing his cap and heading to the front desk of the Wind of Azure Inn to settle the bill. He informed them that this didn't mean that he was checking out.\nDanitz quickly hit the streets and ran straight for a place known as the Seaweed Bar. He found the air fresh and invigorating.\nAfter he took a few steps, he suddenly noticed bounty posters pasted along the walls around a bend.\n\"... Blazing Danitz, 5,500 pounds!\"\nThe posters were just two steps away from Danitz-that familiar face allowed for a clear comparison with his cap-wearing face.\n\"...\"\nDanitz clenched his teeth and revealed a sorrowful smile.\nHe hurriedly pressed down his cap, nearly concealing his normal line of sight.\nBut even so, he still felt uneasy. He went to a recent department store and bought a gray scarf. He wrapped it around his neck and hid his nose and mouth in it.\nAt this point in time, Danitz relaxed somewhat as he sped up his pace and rushed for his destination.\nThe Seaweed Bar was a place where gangs gathered. It was common for infamous pirates to appear there.\nAlthough this place wasn't like the Swordfish Bar or Amyris Leaf Bar that allowed access to a lot of information and resources, it had its own unique niche-it had many resourceful secret channels!\nWhat Danitz wanted to do was buy a scalped ticket to Galagos, as this wouldn't need him to provide any identification.\nHe knew very well that be it in the past or present, his bounty poster would be plastered across all the ticket booths. He had bought the first-class tickets to the White Agate via the same method as well.\nAfter entering the bar, Danitz didn't take off his cap and scarf. He carefully surveyed the area and found Deniel who sold scalped tickets.\nHe didn't directly approach him and instead retracted his gaze from the thin and somewhat swarthy man who was in his thirties. He began searching for someone unfamiliar.\nAfter a round of choices, Danitz squeezed through the crowd and arrived beside a lad who was drinking at the bar counter. He tapped him on the shoulder and suppressed his voice.\n\"Do me a favor.\"\n\"What?\" The lad turned his head warily and ended up seeing a suspicious man. The lower half of his face was covered in a gray scarf and the cap on his head nearly hid his eyes. He revealed almost nothing about his face.\nSuch a dress-up simply meant that he was suspicious!\nThis was because the Rorsted Archipelago's lowest temperature during the winter was about 10\u00b0C!\nDanitz pointed at Deniel.\n\"See that guy over there?\n\"Buy me a ticket for Galagos tomorrow.\"\nHe handed over three one-pound notes and chuckled.\n\"The rest is yours.\"\nAlthough a scalped ticket was much more expensive than a retail ticket, Galagos wasn't too far, making three pounds more than sufficient. Of course, this was also because the journey was relatively shorter, and there was no need for him to buy a first-class ticket.\nThe reason why Danitz didn't buy it himself was because he was worried that Deniel would recognize him, bringing him unwanted trouble.\nBack when his bounty was only 3,000 pounds, pirates and adventurers at his level or lower had to consider how many people were needed to take him down. The bounty received wasn't something that could make them forget about their fear towards Vice Admiral Iceberg and the risk of losing their lives. Hence, very few people would take the initiative to attack him. As such, his safety was pretty much guaranteed in such black markets.\nBut now, his bounty reward had already reached 5,500 pounds. Even if several people joined forces, the amount of money each of them could get was a sizable sum. Furthermore, there were many people out at sea who were desperadoes!\nApart from that, there would be people who found their own bounties too low and wished to prove their strength. These people would definitely challenge a target like Danitz, who was infamous but was of little risk.\nIt was precisely because of this that Danitz was afraid that Deniel would betray him. Therefore, he hired a random person to buy it on his behalf.\nThe lad held the cash and gave Danitz another look before getting up from his seat. He then walked towards Deniel.\nHe deliberately slowed down his footsteps when he walked past some drunkards as he whispered to them.\nWhen Danitz saw this scene, he suddenly became guarded. He thought of a problem-with him acting suspiciously, it was very obvious that there was a problem with him. He was a perfect target for being betrayed.\nHeh, do you think my reputation as Blazing was bought?Danitz planned on teaching the lad a lesson after he obtained the ticket.\nAt this point, he discovered that a familiar figure had walked in. He was an infamous pirate, Blue Eyes Meath, with a bounty of 2,800 pounds.\nAnd this pirate clearly knew this group of people were planning to betray him.\nBlue Eyes Meath still has a few rather powerful subordinates...Danitz didn't hesitate to get up and head for the bar's back door.\nHis speed increased as he agilely forced himself through the drunkards and escaped from the bar. Then, with his rich anti-tracking skills, he completely escaped from the group of people.\nDanitz didn't dare to stay on the streets since it was already dark. The patrolling police and soldiers would begin increasing.\nHe went straight back to the Wind of Azure Inn and opened the door to the luxurious suite. Inside, he saw Gehrman Sparrow admiring the dusk.\nDanitz had a thought as he forced a smile.\n\"There's something. I forgot to mention it just now.\n\"Captain wishes to ask if you have any interest in meeting her at Galagos?\"\nThis was a question he had previously kept secret. He had planned on returning and telling his captain that Gehrman Sparrow wasn't interested. But now, he realized that he had a low chance of surviving in Bayam once he was separated from the crazy adventurer."}
{"num_chp":1305,"summary":"The moment Bernadette saw the black shadow, she instinctively clenched her right hand and conjured an ancient spear.\nFrom the tip of the spear to its handle, it was dyed with crimson red balls. It emitted a strong destructive aura, as though it could harm a true deity.\nSpear of Longinus!\nThis spear had once appeared in an ancient era that couldn't be traced back, stained with the blood of a great existence. At this moment, it had descended into the Black Emperor's mausoleum through Mystical Re-enactment.\nHowever, when Bernadette thrust it forward, she failed to achieve any effects because the tip of the spear was directed at her back.\nDespite wanting to attack the black shadow in front of her, the Spear of Longinus had strangely thrust backward.\nThe area had been affected by \"disorder,\" or suffered some form of distortion.\nAbove the gray fog in the palace, Klein noticed the black shadow when it appeared in front of Bernadette. He didn't hesitate to raise the Staff of the Stars in his hand.\nHe didn't wait this time, unlike his prior observations of Queen Mystic's actions before where he would consider if he would provide her with protection. This was because the level of danger of the black shadow sounded off alarms within him. He was an angel of the Seer pathway after all.\nMore importantly, Bernadette could sense the shadow's existence after entering the Black Emperor's mausoleum from time to time. As for Klein, he was unable to find clues through the true vision provided by Sefirah Castle.\nThis undoubtedly meant danger and terror.\nWhen all the gems embedded in the black cane lit up, the sound of melodious bells resounded in the area where Bernadette and the black shadow were.\nGong!\nThe bell that came from an infinite distance exuded an indescribable emptiness. It made the interior of the Black Emperor's mausoleum visibly freeze, turning Bernadette's figure stiff as if she had been frozen. She couldn't do anything.\nHowever, the black shadow didn't sink into the vortex of time. As though situated in another world built with completely different fundamental rules, the shadow continued moving forward in between the contradictory of two rivers of fate-one filled with raging torrents and one that was almost completely still.\nThis only made it appear to slow down, in no way affected by the illusory bell.\nThis was the first time Klein had encountered such a situation after he gained the ability to replicate powers.\nAlthough the Beyonder effects he had replicated with the Staff of the Stars were lacking compared to the original version, it would still be able to show a certain level of authority that wasn't easy to ignore regardless.\nHowever, the black shadow's slow movements gave him a second chance to try again.\nThis time, he activated the Staff of the Stars's powers and moved Queen Mystic out of the Black Emperor's mausoleum. He wanted her to first conclude what she experienced before considering entering again.\nGems flashed on the tip of the staff, and Bernadette, who was almost about to make contact with the black shadow, disappeared into thin air.\nIn the next second, she appeared tens of meters away, appearing near the high platform in the mausoleum.\nThe Staff of the Stars's teleportation was disrupted. The destination had been distorted, turning everything extremely chaotic.\nThe experienced Bernadette didn't feel any fear or panic because she was stuck inside the Black Emperor mausoleum. She decisively raised her left hand and pressed the Sage Frontlet in the middle of her forehead as she used her fingers to stroke the Pale Death mask.\nThe shimmering golden mask suddenly became soft and rapidly squirmed as if it was about to form a face that didn't belong to Bernadette.\nThe face had soft features and obvious characteristics of a Southern Continent native, but it exuded a bizarre and terrifying feeling. Anyone who witnessed it would believe that it would come alive once the face became clear enough-an entity that came from ancient times, the eternal darkness where the dead slumbered.\nBy then, Bernadette's body, spirituality, and consciousness would all belong to this face.\nWith the protrusion of this face, the stone walls and floor tiles in the Black Emperor mausoleum began to weather. It happened so fast that thousands of years appeared to be washed away in a short span of two seconds.\nThey quickly became mottled, constantly dropping fragments or throwing up dust due to the wind. In between the cracks, thin white fur grew out.\nIn just the blink of an eye, the fur grew into white feathers, and their surface seemed to be soaked in light-yellow oil.\nThe aura of the black figure gradually weakened, as though it was running towards death with huge strides.\nIts color faded away, its movements growing slower.\nWithin the area where the pale-white mask was, even the concept of \"death\" itself would weather away and dissipate.\nHowever, what was labeled as \"death\" wasn't the endpoint. When the stone wall and the floor tiles in the mausoleum were weathered to a certain extent, and when the black figure degraded to a certain stage, new stone blocks began to take form as ethereal auras quickly grew.\nDuring this process, the black figure stretched out his right hand.\nThis palm that was formed from shadows suddenly grabbed Bernadette's neck from dozens of meters away!\nThis wasn't fulfilled by extending the arm, but distorting the concept of distance for an instant-45 meters became equivalent to 45 centimeters.\nThe dark palm didn't exert too much strength, but it made Bernadette feel cold.\nUnder such coldness, she realized that she couldn't use the two Grade 0 Sealed Artifacts of the Sage Frontlet and Pale Death.\nTypically, as long as she injected her spirituality into it and gave the corresponding thoughts, the Sealed Artifacts on her would react in the correct manner, creating different effects. But now, the silent process and rules had been disrupted and distorted. No amount of thoughts that Bernadette willed were able to stir the Sealed Artifacts.\nIt felt like she was speaking to the air.\nKlein, who was above the gray fog, didn't waste any time after failing to teleport Queen Mystic away. A series of complicated symbols and magic labels quickly formed in his mind.\nHe wanted to replicate a Secrets Sorcerer's \"Space Concealment.\" He planned on separating Bernadette's location from the Black Emperor's mausoleum and concealing it to help Queen Mystic escape her current predicament.\nIn fact, it might be more appropriate replicating the fairytale magic, Peace Blossom Source, but considering how Bernadette was formerly a Mysticologist, Klein felt that it was better to use Space Concealment. Otherwise, it might expose some of The Fool's secrets.\nAs for where he had learned \"Space Concealment\" from, it naturally came from the recently advanced Fors.\nPreviously, in the name of The World Gehrman Sparrow, Klein had rented Leymano's Travels. He had also requested Miss Magician to \"Record\" the corresponding powers.\nThen, he released and recorded it while summoning the complete Leymano's Travels from the fog of history again and again. It didn't take long for him to grasp the knowledge and technique, allowing him to replicate \"Spatial Concealment.\"\nAs more gems lit up on the Staff of the Stars, the area around Bernadette darkened, as though it was covered by a curtain weaved by shadows.\nThe curtain distorted as it concealed the space, isolating the black shadow and its palm outside.\nThis helped Bernadette regain her freedom.\nIn the next second, the black palm that had been forcefully separated reached forward again and touched the boundary of the concealed space.\nIn an instant, a transparent vortex-like \"door\" appeared in the abnormal void. Or rather, the secret \"door\" that originally existed appeared autonomously and opened up in front of the black palm.\nAll concealed space had a \"door,\" but the location of the door depended on the creator's thoughts.\nThe palm formed by the shadows rapidly passed through the open \"door\" and entered the concealed space. It grabbed Bernadette's neck and once again disrupted the connection between Queen Mystic and her Sealed Artifact, distorting the corresponding order.\nAt the same time, the black figure raised its head and looked at the top of the mausoleum.\nIt seemed to be studying Sefirah Castle and Klein through layers of space and fog.\nKlein's eyelids twitched instinctively.\nHe sensed that the shadow had a certain understanding of where he was and felt that it was distorting something.\nKlein's expression unknowingly turned abnormally heavy. The different gems on the Staff of the Stars lit up at the same time.\nHe wanted to attempt to steal the corresponding Beyonder powers of the other party. Only by doing so would he have the chance to restrict the black shadow.\nAnd in order to increase the success rate of stealing his target's powers, Klein turned his left palm and tapped the edge of the long mottled table.\nHowever, his \"theft\" failed. He didn't even get anything.\nHis target had long since escaped the lock-on, despite just standing there!\nKlein's gaze froze. Then, he saw the black figure flash and enter the concealed space, closing the distance between it and Bernadette.\nThis... It distorted my true vision, causing the situation I saw to be from one or even two seconds ago... A thought flashed through Klein's mind as he made a preliminary judgment on the previous failure. He then decided to summon Will Auceptin's historical projection to get \"Him\" to reboot the area.\nAt that moment, Bernadette, who was unable to use her Sealed Artifact, grew white, illusory swan feathers on her back.\nThis was her fairytale magic's \"Ugly Duckling.\" It could make Bernadette reveal an incomplete Mythical Creature form while maintaining her clarity of mind. Should could use it twice a day, with each use lasting fifteen seconds.\nAt this moment, her thoughts went wild again. They started to boil and become more chaotic.\nThis caused her \"Ugly Duckling\" magic to be cut off before it could even show its effects.\nAlmost at the same time, she saw the black shadow stick to her body. It was sticky like a viscous, corrosive liquid that seeped into her body.\nBernadette's eyes darkened as she suddenly sensed something. She grabbed the final moment of lucidity and opened her mouth slightly, speaking in a fluent Chinese accent:\n\"Home...\"\nThe black shadow's infiltration paused for a moment. Its upper body slowly rose as it looked at Bernadette."}
{"num_chp":570,"summary":"Eh, why is she looking at Mr. Fool...Audrey sharply noticed The Hermit's subtle motion. This left her somewhat suspicious.\nFrom her point of view, this was an atypical response. Mr. Hanged Man was clearly mentioning something that had little to do with everyone. He was talking about the so-called Sea God Kalvetua's ability to occasionally reply to its believers despite its apparent death, so why would Ma'am Hermit look towards Mr. Fool?\nKalvetua's death... Occasionally replying to its believers... Ma'am Hermit is looking at Mr. Fool... Could it be...Audrey's eyes lit up as she came to a conclusion.\nCould it be that Mr. Fool is the one replying to Kalvetua's believers?\nMa'am Hermit knows about this, so?\nAs thoughts whizzed through her mind, Audrey had turned her body halfway to look expectantly at Mr. Fool, who was seated leisurely at the end of the long bronze table.\nMeanwhile, Alger was also surprised and alarmed about The Hermit's unexpected reaction.\nI was only trying to sound her out about what connection she has with the Moses Ascetic Order member, Leticia. Why would she suddenly turn to look at Mr. Fool?\nCould it be that she knows that the current \"Sea God\" is a manifestation of Mr. Fool?\nHer reaction implies this is highly likely!\nBefore she was recruited into the Tarot Club, did she have a lot of secret exchanges with Mr. Fool, and was already secretly working for him?\nThe more Alger thought, the more he paid attention to The Hermit. Then, he subconsciously joined her in looking towards Mr. Fool, who was shrouded in the grayish-white fog.\nHe, The Hermit, and Justice turned around at different times, but their nearly unanimous actions made The Magician Fors and company notice something amiss.\nWhy are they looking at Mr. Fool? Does Sea God Kalvetua's death have to do with Mr. Fool?Believing they were smart, Fors and Emlyn began guessing at the reason as they cast their gaze to the end of the long bronze table.\nDerrick didn't know who Sea God Kalvetua was, nor did he understand what it meant for it to respond to its believers even after its death. However, since everyone was looking at Mr. Fool, he naturally looked over as well.\nThe World was late by a second, as though he was deliberating over something.\nHe first scanned The Hanged Man, making him shudder in fear. Then, he changed the direction of his gaze.\nAt this point, Klein had already come to realize which detail Ma'am Hermit had used to guess that he was the one replying to Sea God Kalvetua's believers in its stead. He was still stumped over what stance to use.\nShould I pretend that it's a trivial matter and that I didn't take it to heart, but since you mentioned it, I'll just admit it in passing? Or should I take the stance that since I'm a god, there's no need for me to explain myself to you, so there's no need for me to admit or deny anything...Klein recalled The Fool's persona and quickly made a decision.\nThe choice was to neither admit or deny anything, so as to prevent him from losing his standing as a god. However, he would add a single sentence on a particular point, making those who had failed to guess it become more puzzled, while the suspicious ones would be enlightened but would still be left shrouded in confusion as they realized, deep down, how unfathomable Mr. Fool was.\nWith this in mind, Klein, who had leaned back, chuckled. He said leisurely and indifferently, \"Kalvetua became a demigod by relying on a relic left behind by Calamity Cohinem.\"\nSo they're consulting Mr. Fool about the situation with the \"Sea God\"... But that doesn't convince me. It feels like there's a deeper truth hidden behind this matter... Could it be... No way, right?Fors frowned as she began coming up with all sorts of thoughts.\nAs expected!Cattleya believed Mr. Fool was giving a straightforward answer while also informing them of some secrets.\nThat demigod scepter is Kalvetua's characteristic or Calamity Cohinem's relic, or is it something that covers both definitions? Who is Calamity Cohinem? The name sounds elvish. Yes, The Hanged Man mentioned that Leticia found an ancient elven ruin... It's the residence of a high elf?\nHow did Mr. Fool get that scepter? Did he rely on The Hanged Man or someone else? No, it doesn't seem like The Hanged Man; otherwise, he wouldn't have proactively mentioned this matter... What motive does Mr. Fool have behind responding to the Sea God's believers? Is this required for \"His\" awakening, something that can truly affect reality?\nThe more Cattleya thought, the more she found Mr. Fool unfathomable. It was just like how \"His\" body was being concealed by the thick gray fog. The clearer she could see him, the more puzzled, horrified, and apprehensive she became.\nThis might be a tussle between gods...Cattleya sighed inwardly as the emotions got the better of her.\nI guessed right!Alger finally verified that the present \"Sea God\" was a manifestation of The Fool. His worries and indecision from before were instantly rewarded.\nOn certain occasions, as a fake Sea God believer, I can openly pray... I wonder how much Mr. Fool has recovered. How much of his power can he release from the seal? It's at least at the demigod level. He will be able to provide tremendous protection at sea...\nThe Hermit's unsurprised reaction implies that she had long interacted with Mr. Fool and had learned of certain things ahead of time. This implies that her Sequence isn't low. She might really be a powerhouse at the pirate admiral level... This is both good and bad news for me.\nThe good news is that I have an additional powerful faction at sea supporting me. At times, we can tacitly cooperate and complete matters that were previously deemed unimaginable. The bad news is that a lot of my news and resource channels will be overshadowed by hers. My purpose in the Tarot Club will drastically decline. Of course, that's under the premise that she really is Admiral of Stars.\nYes, I have to adjust my focus from gathering news and resources and align it towards the Church. This is something she can't supplant me,Alger thought with joy and wariness.\nThat Sea God is really Mr. Fool! No, no, no, it should be said that the present Sea God is Mr. Fool's manifestation! \"He\" has truly begun interfering with the real world? This is great! In the future, I can pray to Sea God directly and receive a response when I'm out traveling at sea?Audrey felt surprised, overjoyed, and proud.\nAccording to what she knew, the Churches didn't do fixed ritualistic magic internally. The ones who received responses by solely praying to the deities were mainly priests or a chance occurrence; otherwise, they were Blessed who just numbered at a handful.\nAs for receiving a response from every prayer, they would be an extreme exception, even among Blessed.\nBut I can! Mr. Fool is returning to his throne, one step at a time. Replacing Sea God is one of those steps...Audrey didn't hide the changes in her emotions as she smiled, sitting straight and elegantly.\nCohinem? That's an elf's name. I think I've heard someone mention it before...Emlyn attempted to recall, but it was in vain.\nAs for Kalvetua's death and how the \"Sea God\" still replied to its believers, as well as the reason why The Hermit, Justice, The Hanged Man had looked towards Mr. Fool, he had made a slight guess without thinking too deeply about the matter.\nWhat has this got to do with me? It doesn't affect my saving of the Sanguine, nor is it anything of interest! Anyway, I can just pray to Mr. Fool if there are any problems!Emlyn mumbled to himself, showing disdain towards the emotional changes the others had.\nCalamity? Queen of Calamity? But there are no records that say that her name is Cohinem...Derrick turned his head to the left very slightly, a common tick he did when he recalled things.\nFrom the looks of it, Little Sun isn't sure if Cohinem is the Queen of Calamity; otherwise, he wouldn't have such a reaction...Klein retracted his gaze in disappointment.\nHe controlled The World to cough, pulling everyone back from their thoughts.\nFollowing that, The World conjured a picture with The Fool's help. He showed it to both sides of the table and asked, \"Does anyone know her?\"\nIt was a picture of the red-haired Helene. Klein mainly wanted to know if Admiral of Stars Cattleya or The Hanged Man Alger knew her. After all, they were well-informed people out at sea.\nAlger glanced at it and just as he was about to say that he didn't know her, he heard Ma'am Hermit say with a deep voice, \"Red-haired Helene. She's from a fallen noble family and has the bloodline from the Intis's Sauron family.\"\nCattleya paused before adding, \"She was once a trader out at sea, but she was later said to have been abducted by Ailment Maiden Tracy.\"\nAbducted by Ailment Maiden Tracy? I thought it would be some contrived story about a domineering pirate and a noble lady... However, Tracy can be considered a domineering pirate. Heh heh...Klein instantly made some connections.\nFors was still lost in her thoughts over the connection between Sea God and The Fool when she suddenly snapped to her senses. She acutely noticed that great opportunities lay in red-haired Helene and Vice Admiral Ailment's story as she began to daydream.\nTo her regret, Ma'am Hermit had only said a few sentences without continuing.\nThe Hermit knows Vice Admiral Ailment... However, that doesn't imply anything. Beyonders of a certain Sequence or knowledgeable people will know who the seven pirate admirals are. Their bounty posters are everywhere... Hmm, The Hermit is rather aware of matters over at Intis. This is something that can be determined for now...The Hanged Man wasn't interested in red-haired Helene, only The Hermit's real identity.\nWith red-haired Helene's matter coming to a close, Audrey began considering if she should consult the others about the mind dragon.\nUnlike before, there was now the addition of Ma'am Hermit, who was of unknown character and dubious allegiances. This left her hesitant.\nAfter a brief deliberation, she said, \"I recently sought out the traces of a mind dragon and went to a place which has the tradition of worshiping dragons.\"\nShe had concealed the exact location as the details might implicate her."}
{"num_chp":868,"summary":"Eh...Fors was taken aback, suspecting that she had seen wrong.\nFollowing that, she couldn't help but have thoughts surface in her mind.\nMr. World wishes to take this mission? That's right. He's in Backlund.\nBut this is an investigation, not a murder. Dwayne Dant\u00e8s is already pitiful enough. Leave Dwayne alone!\nEliminating the investigation target implies completing the investigation? Because there will be no need to make another investigation...\nWhat do I do? Do I still take the mission? It's a full 500 pounds. I just need to recount what I previously discovered to receive 200 pounds, but the competitor is Mr. World... Perhaps we can cooperate and not compete?\nEh? Why would Mr. World be interested in this mission? His focus is actually on the framing of Baron Syndras or the assault on Member of Parliament Macht?\nFors finally grasped the problem at its core. As for Alger and Cattleya, they had already cast their gaze at The World. To them, be it the framing of Baron Syndras, the assault on Member of Parliament Macht, or Dwayne Dant\u00e8s's donation of more than ten thousand pounds, they weren't something that needed special notice. However, to have Mr. Fool's Blessed choose to accept the investigation mission meant that the problem was bound to be extremely complicated. It made them feel that there were important secrets underlying the matter.\nEmlyn didn't think too much about it, but he had also sensed that the seemingly ordinary investigation mission wasn't that simple. His plans on earning some pocket money to make up for the 5,000 pounds that he had just lost were overturned as he suddenly didn't want to say a word.\nDwayne Dant\u00e8s is really something. There must be a big problem with him that makes Mr. World choose to investigate him? Or are those two cases more important and more critical than I imagined?Audrey's mind stirred as she turned her eyes, and she used the advantage of her seating position to take in all the reactions of the Tarot Club members.\nAmong them, Derrick was the only exception.\nTo him, wasn't it normal for the Tarot Club to help each other? If someone gave a mission and one was capable of completing it, wasn't it normal to take it?\nAudrey moved her gaze to The World and asked with hidden anticipation, \"Mr. World, you wish to receive this mission?\"\nAfter returning to Backlund, she had gathered up the news at sea over the past few months, roughly confirming that Mr. World was the crazy adventurer, Gehrman Sparrow. While she was deeply impressed by this seemingly polite but dangerous gentleman who had accomplished many great deeds, she felt that her feelings to adventure out at sea had waned.\nKlein had already thought of a response. He had controlled The World to lower his hand and wait for Miss Justice to ask. At this moment, he made Gehrman Sparrow's expression turn solemn and reply with a deep voice, \"Dwayne Dant\u00e8s is an identity.\"\nAfter a period of brief but repeated considerations, Klein decided to expose some information. He made Dwayne Dant\u00e8s be one of his public facades as a Blessed!\nHe believed if he chose to conceal the matter, there was a chance of being exposed in the future. This was because Dwayne Dant\u00e8s was about to enter Backlund's high society. He could find clues to the Great Smog of Backlund or other cases. This way, he might very well need Miss Justice to provide him with assistance. When that happens, the Spectator would probably sense something and discover that The World was previously hiding something and that Mr. Fool had never mentioned it.\nThis would lower her sense of belonging and make her even begin suspecting even more matters, causing her faith in The Fool to be borderline dangerous.\nWith two members not knowing each other, or knowing of the other's existence, to tacitly work together to complete a specified mission together to accomplish a complete goal sounded perfect, but in reality, its success was very difficult. Even more so, there was no way he could fool her!\nTherefore, most of the time, honesty was more effective and less worrisome than lying.\nAs for why he didn't directly say that Dant\u00e8s was Gehrman Sparrow, it was because Klein didn't wish to leave the Tarot Club members the impression as to why it was the same person again. He didn't want them to have the impression that he was the only Blessed of Mr. Fool that appeared.\nDwayne Dant\u00e8s is only an identity?Audrey sharply read between the lines and had a theory.\nThen, she heard The World simply say, \"A common identity that me and my companions share.\n\"I will occasionally disguise myself as him.\"\nUpon saying that, he emotionlessly swept his gaze across The Magician.\nA common identity... Occasionally disguise as him. That very pitiful Dwayne Dant\u00e8s is Mr. World? That tycoon with kidney or bladder problems is Mr. Gehrman Sparrow?Fors felt as though she was struck by lightning as she froze up.\nHer brain turned numb as she felt struck with fear, subconsciously feeling that Xio's unintentional comment made a lot of sense.\nWhen a butler, valet, neighbor, and surroundings had problems, the person that seemed ordinary definitely wouldn't be ordinary!\nNo, it's not the street where Dwayne Dant\u00e8s stays at, or that he happened to hire a butler with a secret, it's because of that secret that he was selected by Dwayne Dant\u00e8s-selected by Gehrman Sparrow! The pitiful one isn't Dwayne Dant\u00e8s but the Beyonders and Beyonder items around him! I was wrong. I shouldn't have gotten Xio to ask the Goddess to bless him. It's more of a curse for Mr. World...Fors suddenly trembled, thankful that she hadn't left a comment in her note that Dwayne Dant\u00e8s should check on his kidneys or bladder.\nOtherwise, she suspected that she wouldn't be able to participate in the next Tarot Gathering. Or perhaps, she would appear in the form of a Beyonder characteristic, sold to the other members by The World.\nLogically speaking, Mr. World shouldn't know that I'm The Magician, but I was carrying Leymano's Travels with me... He had used the spellbook before and had added demigod-level Beyonder powers to it! He had definitely observed me in secret, remembering my appearance and evaluating my value...The fear in Fors was surging like a tumultuous sea as her expression was filled with misery.\nAt this moment, she saw Mr. World sweep his cold glance at her, her feelings of regret instantly becoming that of extreme regret.\nThankfully, I didn't rush to answer and mention my impression of Dwayne Dant\u00e8s...When Fors gradually calmed down from her horror, she couldn't help but think of another problem.\nDuring the bodyguard mission, were we the ones protecting Dwayne Dant\u00e8s, or was Dwayne Dant\u00e8s protecting us... Should I refund Mr. Gehrman Sparrow his money?\nThis... At times, Dwayne Dant\u00e8s is equivalent to Mr. World...Audrey was first stunned before finding all her questions answered.\nFors does know Dwayne Dant\u00e8s, but she didn't know that he's Mr. World. It can be proven from her shocked reaction just now.\nThe reason that Dwayne Dant\u00e8s was shocked when he saw me was because he recognized Lie. Although this mystical item has changed, it comes from a Beyonder characteristic that Mr. World provided. Perhaps this crazy adventurer can sense it somehow. After all, Gehrman Sparrow can transform into anyone with the powers of shapeshifting!\nAlthough I only asked Mr. Hanged Man what will happen when an animal consumes a potion, the potion ingredients I gathered later were always in pairs. Mr. World might very well have guessed that I have a Spectator beside me based on that; hence, he became wary against Susie who was secretly observing everyone in the hall... Others might not doubt an animal, but Mr. World is experienced. He must've interacted with Beyonder creatures, so it's very normal for him to be wary against such things.\nWhich is to say, Dwayne Dant\u00e8s, no-Mr. World Gehrman Sparrow knew that I was Justice, but he didn't choose to make contact or communicate with me. Hmm, there's nothing wrong with his choice of actions. Under those circumstances, unless he directly says it, it will be difficult for me to guess or believe it. Furthermore, talking about the Tarot Club in Saint Samuel Cathedral is... is just too crazy!\nAfter a brief moment of surprise, Audrey's emotions calmed down, leaving her only with excitement.\nApart from The Magician Fors who she introduced, this was her first meeting with another member of the Tarot Club!\nIt feels like a historic moment! Yes, Mr. World as well as Mr. Fool's other Blessed. Eh, they should also be considered The World. But why was the identity of Dwayne Dant\u00e8s made? What are they up to?\nThe matter of Baron Syndras being framed, Member of Parliament Macht being assaulted, and their donation to establish a bursary foundation really are more complicated and important than I originally imagined... Why do I feel that the kingdom's upper echelons are beginning to stir in a state of unrest? I had this feeling back when Prince Edessak died during the Great Smog of Backlund. Today, it's even more intense...\nNow that I know the identity of Dwayne Dant\u00e8s, I might be able to participate and cooperate indirectly, reducing the risk my parents might suffer, reducing the risk of the innocent...Amidst her thoughts, Audrey quickly made up her mind. She would accept her father's choice to join the Loen Charity Bursary Foundation, then she inwardly quipped,Wouldn't it be very logical to have Justice from the Tarot Club join the charity foundation established by Mr. World from the Tarot Club?\nAlger and Cattleya weren't too surprised that Dwayne Dant\u00e8s was The World, that he was the amalgamation of Mr. Fool's Blessed. In their minds, another thought flashed through their minds:Something major is about to happen in Backlund!"}
{"num_chp":845,"summary":"It really is the spirit world...Klein was delighted as he inwardly muttered to himself.\nWithout needing further confirmation, his spirituality and spiritual perception had told him that this was the real spirit world!\nAnd this meant that he had returned to the real world, the place with all kinds of delicacies.\nI nearly cried tears of joy...Klein inwardly made a self-deprecating comment as he considered where he was supposed to head to next.\nFrom the position of the stars, moon, and sun, it's still morning. If there's no time difference between the real world and the foggy town, it's at most 7:30 a.m., or maybe earlier. At this point, the servants must've discovered the disappearance of their mate, and they would definitely inform the priests and bishops.\nEven if they have received the corresponding training and would report to their superiors according to the protocol, they will have to first eliminate the possibility that someone was skiving away or having a stomachache. They would need more than ten minutes before confirming this and begin taking the necessary actions.\nAnd after the report to their superiors, the priests and bishops wouldn't be able to instantly tell the severity of the matter. They would only believe that the servant had escaped, and they wouldn't quickly connect this matter to the Keepers. After they do a divination or investigation to figure out the truth, it would be twenty to thirty minutes later.\nThat also means that they likely haven't begun their search in the surrounding area to find the intruder. The identity of Dwayne Dant\u00e8s hasn't been exposed yet.\nHmm, if the Bizarro Sorcerer potion formula given by Zaratul is real, then the identity of Dwayne Dant\u00e8s still has many uses. If I can still keep the identity going, I should try harder to not abandon it.\nBesides, the only things that I'm wearing, which are real, are my glove and underwear. If I head elsewhere, I'll be a pervert...\nKlein already had a choice he was leaning towards. He took out the iron cigar case, which appeared to be inside his pocket, but was actually lodged under a rubber band. He opened it and took out the gold coin inside.\n\"Returning to 160 B\u00f6klund Street is dangerous,\" Klein muttered seven times, and with a flick, he saw it slowly spin in the spirit world, wobbling up and down, left and right, before landing on his palm.\nThis time, it was tails, indicating a negative response!\nKlein nodded indiscernibly and immediately traveled towards Backlund.\nAfter three stops, his figure finally appeared in his room at 160 B\u00f6klund Street. The curtains were drawn tightly and it was dim. It was very suitable for sleeping.\nAnd on the bed, Dwayne Dant\u00e8s was lying on the bed facing up. His hands were grabbing the ends of the blanket near his neck.\nFrom the looks of it, the investigation hasn't reached me... This appearance is ridiculous...Klein secretly heaved a sigh of relief and saw \"Dwayne Dant\u00e8s\" dissipate and turn into a palm-sized mirror.\nWater ripples appeared on the mirror's surface as silver light bloomed and turned into Loenese text:\n\"Exalted Great Master, did you encounter something? Your loyal and humble servant, Arrodes, failed to sense you before!\"\n\"It wasn't anything important,\" Klein answered perfunctorily.\nThis made him confirm that Arrodes was unable to pry into the secrets that happened in the foggy town. After all, this fellow was able to present the environment where the rampaging Zaratul was.\nIt really is related to the authorities of a deity?Klein's mind stirred as he asked, \"Did anyone look for me?\"\n\"No, no one came to disturb you.\" The silver on the mirror's surface changed and produced new words.\nKlein felt truly relieved as he said to Arrodes, \"You may leave. I'll summon you again if needed.\"\n\"Alright, Master. Goodbye, Master~\" Like before, Arrodes produced a drawing of a hand waving on the mirror.\nAfter the aqueous light vanished, the mirror was restored to normal. Klein walked to the bedside and pulled out the pajamas underneath and wore it.\nThen, he took out candles and other items before entering the bathroom. He set up a sacrificial ritual, preparing to send Creeping Hunger, Azik's copper whistle, the iron cigar case, and the various mysticism materials above the gray fog to avoid any investigations he might face.\nAfter doing all of this, Klein didn't delay and sat at The Fool's seat. He conjured the Bizarro Sorcerer's potion formula in front of him.\n\"Sequence 4: Bizarro Sorcerer.\n\"Main ingredient: Bizarro Bane's main eye, the true soul body of a Spirit World Plunderer.\n\"Supplementary ingredients: 200 ml of a Bizarro Bane's blood, 30 grams of a Spirit World Plunderer, 10 grams of Red-hair Birch bark. One segment of golden grapevines, fingernail-sized Self-made Rubber Mask.\n\"Advancement ritual: Relying on one's strength and strategy, orchestrate a grand performance before many spectators to kill a Beyonder creature at the level of a demigod. Then, at the end of the performance, consume the potion.\"\nKlein didn't consider what this ritual actually meant. Beneath the potion formula, he wrote a corresponding statement.\nFollowing that, he summoned a spirit pendulum from the junk pile. Holding it in his left hand, he began a divination.\nBefore long, Klein opened his eyes and saw the dangling topaz rotating clockwise.\nThis meant that the Bizarro Sorcerer potion formula he had was genuine!\nPhew...Klein exhaled as he took the opportunity to determine what kind of changes Creeping Hunger had experienced, as well as what the various negative side effects were.\nAfter a dream divination and several direct attempts, he figured out the exact situation in less than two minutes.\nCreeping Hunger could now Graze seven souls. During each Grazing process, it could obtain two or three Beyonder powers. One of them can be chosen by the wearer.\nThere are currently eight souls inside Creeping Hunger. The others completely dissipated from the mutation brought about by the Attendant of Mysteries. And due to the excessive number of souls, it caused a \"congestion,\" making some of the powers unusable. One soul needs to be released to restore it back to normal.\nAt present, the first of the eight souls is Baron of Corruption, which is Wormtongue Mithor. He fused with the Beyonder characteristics of the same pathway that Mr. A had Grazed. Apart from Distortion and Bribe-Weaken, there's another area of effect Beyonder power called Corrosion. It can turn the hearts of people within ten meters dark and greedy, making them make irrational choices.\nThe second is Desire Apostle Kircheis. He fused with Mr. A's Devil and replaced Danger Premonition, which requires advanced activation before being useful, with Sulfur Fireball. And Language of Foulness-Slow and Sword of Lava have been enhanced.\nThird is Traveler, Mr. X Lewis Wien. He fused with Mr. A's Scribe. While keeping Traveling and Door-Opening, it has obtained the Beyonder power of Record. However, there's a change. It's unable to record ordinary Beyonder powers, and it can only be used against targets at the demigod level. The chance of success has been increased. Although it's still very troublesome, eight times or so would be needed as long as I'm not too unlucky. In addition, it cannot record more than two demigod-level Beyonder powers, and cannot exceed Sequence 3.\nFourth is Zombie Maveti. There hasn't been any change. It's still the original Zombie Strength, Ice Control and Zombie Manipulation.\nFifth is an unknown Demoness of Affliction. She can give the user a rather powerful sense of charm. In addition, one's appearance would receive an adjustment to a certain degree. In addition, she can provide an ailment that covers 50 meters. Creatures within that range will slowly be infected, and the effects slowly become severe. In the beginning, it might be oversensitive skin, a cold, or a fever. But twenty to thirty seconds later, it might very well turn into serious illnesses like pneumonia. After two or three minutes, one can suddenly suffer cardiac arrest or a brain aneurysm.\nSixth is an unknown Wind-blessed. There are three Beyonder powers-Short-distance Flight, Dive, and Water Control.\nSeventh is an unknown Soul Assurer with the two Beyonder powers of forcefully pulling one into a dream and causing a Spirit Body to sleep.\nEighth is an unknown Doctor with the three Beyonder powers of distinguishing the time, treatment of serious ailments, and stitching souls.\nAt the same time, Creeping Hunger itself has Shadow Lurking and Flesh Bomb. Furthermore, it has the chance and strength to barely Graze a Sequence 4 saint.\nIt has instantly become so much stronger...As Klein was secretly delighted, he also frowned at the negative side effects.\nNow, Creeping Hunger had to eat a living person every day, otherwise it would devour the wearer. At the same time, it would praise the True Creator from time to time in the wearer's mind. It would bring about chaotic thoughts and a headache. Apart from those two, it was also still afraid of mushrooms. No powers could be used if mushrooms appeared within five meters of it.\nTo randomly praise the True Creator is really troublesome. Same for eating a living person every day... I'll first throw it above the gray fog and let it calm down for a few days. Perhaps there might be some changes. If that really doesn't work, I can only write to Mr. Azik...Klein quickly made up his mind and didn't hesitate to release the Soul Assurer's soul.\nHe also planned on swapping the Wind-blessed and Doctor later. The Demoness of Affliction depended on the circumstances.\nTo the side of the bronze table, the Soul Assurer's spirit surfaced. But due to the mutation, it couldn't be maintained once it lost its host. It rapidly dissipated.\nHis Beyonder characteristic was produced. It was entirely black in color. At its core was pure shimmering light that looked like a night sky with embedded stars.\nAfter doing this, Klein didn't hesitate to throw Creeping Hunger and the other items into the junk pile. He then quickly returned to the real world, ended the ceremony, and cleared up any traces.\nFollowing that, he washed his face and brushed his teeth to make Dwayne Dant\u00e8s look sharp.\nAfter leaving the bathroom, Klein, in his pajamas, walked to the door with his usual expression. He pulled open the door and said to his valet outside, \"Prepare a set of clothes that's suitable for home wear.\"\n\"Yes, sir.\" Richardson didn't ask why as he immediately walked to the wardrobe.\nOnly at this point, with him seeing his servant's back, did Klein confirm that he was out of harm's way and had returned back to his normal life."}
{"num_chp":716,"summary":"Mr. World has also obtained the potion formula and main ingredient for Ocean Songster. He's really impressive!Derrick moved his gaze from the goatskin in his hand and looked at the gentleman seated at the other end of the long bronze table.\nIn his mind, The World's toughness had reached a whole new level, one that could match the weaker members in the six-member council!\nFors was also similarly astonished as her poignancy grew deeper.\nShe remembered that back when she first joined the Tarot Club, Mr. World gave her the impression that he was gloomy and reserved. Apart from that, nothing stood out. In the subsequent gatherings, he began to show that he was experienced and knowledgeable, as well as possessing rather impressive abilities. At a glance, he was a senior Beyonder who had experienced many things, just second to Mr. Hanged Man amongst the Tarot Club members.\nThis image had already formulated in Fors's mind, but in recent months, Miss Magician was repeatedly surprised by The World.\nHe was first capable of obtaining rather important information, and following that, he sold plenty of Beyonder characteristics in a short span of time. He made her involuntarily suspect if he was a Beyonder assassin who was active in the mysterious world. She feared him from the bottom of her heart, but along with that came happiness. This was because it meant that she could commission Mr. World with certain requests that would be met with high chances of success.\nWhen the new member, The Hermit, appeared, Fors even imagined that Mr. World's halo would be blanketed by this powerful lady. But to her surprise, he had snatched the \"limelight,\" and blinded everyone with his magnificence.\nTo obtain the Ocean Songster potion formula, its corresponding main ingredient, and the Notary potion formula was seemingly impossible by human standards!\nHe really is impressive. I admire this kind of quiet and ordinary person who is actually very capable. Sigh, I wonder when I can become a Viscount. After this hunting competition, the winner will receive a prize that's likely something that will allow a Sanguine to become stronger...Emlyn White quickly turned his thoughts back to himself.\nAs Audrey was sighing in amazement, she was puzzled about a matter from before.\nWhy is the impressive Mr. World not searching for Emperor Roselle's diary pages? Hmm, he's not like Ma'am Hermit. He has already joined the Tarot Club for quite some time, and he doesn't need to observe... It's not like he doesn't have any requests that don't require him to search for Emperor Roselle's diary pages to obtain something from Mr. Fool... Then, why isn't he searching for them?\nHas he privately submitted them? But why?\nImperceptibly, Audrey felt that Mr. World and Mr. Fool had a connection to a certain degree, but she wasn't able to confirm it, as there were just too many possibilities.\nAt this moment, Alger turned to the seat of honor after a few seconds of silence.\n\"Honorable Mr. Fool, I wish to communicate privately with The World.\"\nHere it comes...Klein nodded with anticipation as he isolated everyone's senses.\nAlger waited for two seconds before turning back to look at The World, Gehrman Sparrow.\n\"I will use an unknown primitive island's coordinates in exchange.\n\"On the island, there aren't only extinct Beyonder creatures that cannot be found on the Northern and Southern Continent, but there's an ancient ruin of unknown age.\n\"Back then... Phew... It was discovered by Qilangos and me. Back then, we lacked the strength to delve deep inside it. However, he discovered certain traces, and he suspected that the ruins hide something extremely, extremely important. He believes that the value isn't lower than a card created by Emperor Roselle.\n\"My strength is inferior to Qilangos, and I didn't go as deep as he did. I had no idea what he saw, other than guesses about the situation from his remarks.\"\n... What Mr. Hanged Man said holds plenty of information. From the looks of it, he long knew Vice Admiral Hurricane Qilangos. They had even adventured together and found the primitive island and ancient ruins. And previously, he was also the one who thought of finishing off this pirate admiral while he was away at sea... Mr. Hanged Man isn't an ordinary member of the Church of Storms. His past seems very complicated, and he hides many secrets... Yes, a primitive island's value isn't small. For a secret organization, this can be the foundation to support the growth of its members...Klein controlled The World to appear to be in thought as he attempted to obtain more information from The Hanged Man.\nWith The World not rejecting or agreeing, Alger, who had calmed down, calmly said, \"On the island, there are traces of demigod-level Beyonder creatures. To you, that should be something valuable.\n\"On this point, I can swear on Mr. Fool's name. I guarantee that I'm not lying.\"\nAfter I obtain the Bizarro Sorcerer's potion formula, I'll have to consider how to obtain the corresponding ingredients. At the level of a demigod, money becomes of little use. Trading gives me the highest chance of obtaining something I need... The location of demigod-level Beyonder creatures is important. That ruin is also quite interesting...The World didn't hesitate as he chuckled.\n\"Deal.\"\nAlger didn't immediately receive the Ocean Songster potion formula. Instead, he said, \"I have a condition. I wish that on your first exploration of the primitive island, that you will do it with me. With Mr. Fool watching all of this, I believe you won't be concerned that I'll be up to no good.\"\nKlein considered it for a moment and made The World nod.\n\"No problem. I will need companions when heading to dangerous places. I hope that you will have the required strength.\"\nAlger wasn't angered by The World's tone as he heaved a sigh of relief.\n\"That's why, I wish that your first exploration will be after I advance. Of course, if I were to lose control because of my potion, this agreement will naturally be null and void.\"\n\"No problem,\" The World replied without any qualms.\nAlger didn't harp on the topic. After obtaining Mr. Fool's agreement, he conjured the situation of the primitive island on a goatskin.\nIt's along the periphery of the Rorsted Sea... It's quite a big island, almost the size of Blue Mountain Island...Klein received the goatskin and quickly scanned through it to gain a general understanding of the primitive island.\nHe quickly looked up and said, \"I'll hand over the potion formula and main ingredient after the gathering ends.\"\n\"Alright.\" Having made his choice, Alger no longer had any reservations. When hearing that, he felt upheavals going through his heart, but he appeared even more staid on the surface.\nAfter the duo's private conversation came to an end, Cattleya retracted her gaze at The World and looked at Fors.\n\"The Meteorite Crystal has been obtained. 600 pounds for 60 grams.\"\nThat's fast... Ma'am Hermit is really efficient!Fors felt delighted, but she was also stumped.\nAfter last week's gathering, she had already obtained the crystallized blood of a Lavos Squid. For that, she had paid 600 pounds, leaving her with 230 pounds. Adding the 150 pounds she received this week from her royalties, she was still short of 220 pounds.\nI'll first borrow from Xio. She should have that much... After I succeed in advancing, I'll try to earn money as quickly as possible! I have to!Fors silently drew a breath and said, \"Alright. We will do the transaction tomorrow at this time.\"\nThe Hermit tersely acknowledged and, without wasting any time, looked at Audrey.\n\"The Black-hunting Giant Lizard's spinal fluid has been confirmed. 1,800 pounds. There are temporarily no clues for the Illusory Chime Tree's fruit.\"\n\"That's already very good. Better than I expected. Thank you, Ma'am Hermit.\" Audrey sincerely thanked her without even minding the price.\nShe recently realized that there was a benefit to establishing the \"Relic Search and Preservation Foundation.\" She could use her funds in a more secretive and unnoticeable manner. It made it difficult for her parents to notice.\nAfter confirming the two transactions, Cattleya surveyed the members as though she was one of them.\n\"Any clues to the blood of a Mythical Creature?\"\nKlein immediately controlled The World as he chuckled with a hoarse voice.\n\"Are you referring a pure Mythical Creature?\"\nPure Mythical Creature? There are impure Mythical Creatures?Audrey and company were puzzled but interested by what they heard.\nCattleya was taken aback as she said, \"A pure one, which means the blood of an angel. One drop is enough.\"\nShe didn't introduce it in detail back then, because she believed that for the time being such a high-level object wouldn't appear in the Tarot Club unless Mr. Fool was willing to provide her with help. And clearly, Mr. Fool didn't need anyone to explain to \"Him\" what a Mythical Creature was.\n\"I have certain clues, but I can't guarantee that I can obtain it. Furthermore, it might take another three months at least.\" Klein controlled The World to give the response.\nThe other Tarot Club members fell silent. They never expected The World to have clues to an angel's blood!\nWhat can't he accomplish?Audrey, Fors, and company had their impression of Mr. World refreshed again.\nAs for Alger, he suspected that The World would seek Mr. Fool's angel for a drop of blood.\nAfter a brief moment of silence, Emlyn, who suddenly realized that his advancement wasn't necessarily as obvious as the other members, weakly said, \"Are there any clues regarding my previous commission?\"\nFors immediately said, \"There are suspected cases. I will continue investigating.\"\nBurdened with debt, she was motivated to work.\nAt the end of the trading segment, Derrick mentioned his request of buying the crystallized roots of the Tree of Elders. As for the feathers of a Spirit Pact Bird, the City of Silver had it in their special warehouse.\nIn addition, he also sought to purchase the Golden-edged Sunflower and other supplementary ingredients. They were commonly seen items in the outside world, but they were lacking in the Forsaken Land of God.\n\"The crystallized roots of the Tree of Elders and the supplementary ingredients aren't difficult to obtain.\" Emlyn's attention was caught as he said, \"Then, what can you use in exchange?\"\nBack when he provided Miss Justice with the fruit of the Tree of Elders, he had already learned where the crystallized roots were.\nDerrick thought and said, \"A Beyonder characteristic of a Sequence 5 Vampire?\"\nIt was quite a commonly seen monster in the depths of the darkness.\n\"Sanguine!\" Emlyn said through gritted teeth. \"There's no rush. I'll tell you when I've decided what I need.\"\nHe didn't want an item obtained from a transaction to overlap with the prize of the hunting competition.\n\"Alright.\" Having already owed a debt to The World, Derrick was relatively at ease.\nAfter a moment of silence, Klein rapped the edge of the mottled table to indicate the commencement of the free exchange."}
{"num_chp":1062,"summary":"Klein glanced at Leonard and smiled.\n\"The targets aren't demigods. They've only \u2018lived' to this day due to some sort of influence. This is also the secret I wish to discover through dreams.\"\nHe deliberately emphasized the word \"lived.\"\nWithout waiting for Leonard to respond, Klein continued, \"The aristocrat from the Fourth Epoch is a member of the Zoroast family. You might be able to use his dream to learn more about Pallez Zoroast.\"\nOld Man's descendant... Leonard's heart stirred as he looked forward to the proposal that Klein raised.\nAlthough he had gotten along rather well with Pallez Zoroast and gradually built some trust in this angel, he still held the most basic level of vigilance against him. After all, \"He\" was an outsider who lived in his body.\nAt that moment, Klein added, \"For now, don't mention this matter to Pallez Zoroast.\"\nDo you think I'm such an unreliable person? Leonard grumbled inwardly as he replied, \"There's no need to remind me.\"\nSeeing that Leonard had agreed, Klein smiled and said, \"Get me a few drops of your blood when you return. This is necessary to explore the dreams.\"\nHe didn't specifically mention how to give the blood to him. After all, Leonard knew at least two methods. Firstly, he could sacrifice it to Mr. Fool and request that \"He\" bestow it to The World. The other was to summon the messenger of mysterious origins and place the blood inside a bottle, sending it over with a letter.\n\"Blood...\" Leonard subconsciously repeated the word.\nIn mysticism, one's blood was an important item. It was best not to give one's blood to others; otherwise, they might die without knowing the reason. Sometimes, death wasn't the most terrifying outcome that could happen.\nAfter a brief moment of hesitation, Leonard nodded.\n\"When will the exploration begin?\"\nKlein was prepared for this question as he replied, \"Late Sunday night, close to midnight.\"\nHe wanted to give Miss Justice time to converge her spirituality and familiarize herself with her abilities.\n\"Alright.\" Leonard didn't say anything else.\nFollowing that, Klein seriously explained skills in sophistry so that the dear poet knew how to pacify his grandpa after returning.\nAfter returning to the real world, Leonard was deliberating over his words when he heard Pallez Zoroast's slightly-aged voice:\n\"Why did your former colleague look for you? Is there anything that cannot be explained in a letter?\"\nLeonard adjusted his sitting posture and chuckled.\n\"He's afraid that the letter will be leaked. After all, it might involve that person.\"\nJust as he finished his sentence, Leonard inwardly mumbled, Of course, the most important thing is to be wary of you. What I see is equivalent to what you see...\n\"That person...\" Pallez Zoroast seemed to understand who he was referring to.\nYeah.\" Leonard picked up a cup on the table and drank a mouthful of malt beer. \"He found an ascetic from the Third Epoch. He hopes to learn the history of that epoch through his dream.\"\nWhat Leonard said was the truth, but it was only a portion of the truth. This was the skill that Klein had specially taught him.\n\"An ascetic from the Third Epoch? He's still alive?\" Pallez Zoroast asked in surprise.\nOf course, \"He\" wasn't too surprised. After all, at \"His\" level, even if \"He\" didn't grasp a hundred methods that allowed people to live from the Third Epoch, \"He\" knew at least five or six methods. The easiest way was to steal the time or life of others to imbue it into a target.\n\"He's likely still alive, but has a very special condition,\" Leonard explained what he knew.\nPallez Zoroast fell silent for two seconds before saying with a chuckle, \"Is that so? Then I can only wish you the best in not seeing scenes you shouldn't see in the dream. Of course, your former colleague is protected by an existence of Concealment, so he must be prepared.\"\nLeonard didn't respond to the topic. He suddenly exclaimed, \"Old man, are you actually not the least bit curious? Don't you want to know what the true deities were like in the Third Epoch, or the cause of the Cataclysm?\"\nThis was the second technique in sophistry that Klein taught him. Rather than being asked, it was better to take the initiative to ask questions.\n\"I can roughly guess what's going on,\" Pallez Zoroast replied with a sigh. He then scoffed. \"You took too much initiative to control the flow of our conversation today. This is very different from your past behavior. This means that you have a secret you're hiding deep down. Not bad, it's much better than the past. At least it's not something that can be seen through at once.\"\nLeonard's expression froze.\nPallez immediately chuckled.\n\"See, I just gave it a try and you exposed yourself. You still lack training.\nYour former colleague is really... Tsk...\"\nLeonard could only respond with a dry chuckle. He put down his cup and leaned forward. He then picked up a silver ritual dagger and cut open a wound, causing a few drops of blood to drip out.\nMeanwhile at Earl Hall's residence, Audrey was also holding a dagger with gems embedded in it. She was preparing to fulfill the promise of providing help for free. She moved the tip of the dagger towards the back of her hand.\n\"The pain is very mild...\nThe pain is very mild...\" As she hypnotized herself, she exerted force and tore open a wound.\nIt was currently impossible to tear her skin without using strength, even if she didn't reveal her dragon scales.\nOn Sunday night, after attending a ball, Klein returned to 160 Boklund Street. He made up an excuse that he was feeling tired and needed to sleep early.\nIn the wee hours of the night, he got out of bed, set up a ritual, and summoned himself.\nAfter some work, he sat in the seat that belonged to The World Gehrman Sparrow. He confirmed that once the summoning ended, he could use the gray fog's level and standing to forcefully extricate himself from Groselle's Travels.\nAt that moment, in front of him were three metal bottles and a silver mask.\nThe former was filled with his, Leonard's, and Audrey's blood, while the latter was sacrificed by Miss Justice ahead of time. As she knew that Mr. Star would be involved in the exploration of the dream this time, she planned on wearing Lie the entire time to mask her face and avoid her identity from being uncovered.\nAfter examining it for a while, Klein made the hard-covered, deep-brown Groselle's Travels to fly out of the junk pile and land on the long bronze table. At the same time, he placed the Unshadowed Crucifix into his body.\nFollowing that, he pulled Justice Audrey and The Star Leonard above the gray fog.\nTwo dark red beams shot up at the same time, forming rather blurry figures.\nAudrey and Leonard cast their gazes at the bottom of the long, mottled table and sized up the items in front of Mr. World.\nThen, their attention was drawn to the ancient book.\nAudrey's eyes darted around as she curiously asked, \"Our exploration this time is related to this book?\"\nYes, our targets are inside this book,\" Klein replied with a smile.\n\"Inside the book?\" Leonard asked in surprise.\nEven though he was a Red Glove, and had also read a large number of supernatural case files, he had never heard of communicating with characters in a book.\nKlein nodded slightly and said, \"Yes, this is a magical book. Inside it, there is a world that was \u2018envisioned.' What happens in that world becomes the book's contents.\"\n\"Envisioned?\" Audrey acutely grasped a key phrase, linking it to its synonyms.\nShe had only just learned a few days ago from Mr. World that the Spectator pathway's Sequence 0 was called Visionary, and she knew very well that the King of Dragons, the ancient god, Ankewelt, was the Dragon of Imagination.\nAfter some deliberation, Klein said, \"My description might not be accurate. It might be an \u2018envisioned' world or a true dream. The only thing I can confirm is that it was created by an ancient god from the Second Epoch, the Dragon of Imagination Ankewelt. I obtained it from Vice Admiral Iceberg.\"\nAncient god's relic... It's no wonder that it can make a giant and elf from the Second Epoch, a Third Epoch ascetic, a Fourth Epoch human aristocrat, and Fifth Epoch Loenese soldier survive till now... Leonard came to a realization as he couldn't help but size up The World Gehrman Sparrow. He couldn't imagine what kind of experiences Klein had ever since he left Tingen.\nAt this moment, Klein looked around and pushed the Lie mask to Miss Justice as he said, \"Let's head on in.\"\n\"Alright.\" Audrey put on the silver mask.\nLeonard looked around and nodded.\n\"Okay.\"\nKlein immediately picked up the three metal bottles and poured out some of the blood inside, smearing it on the cover of Groselle's Travels.\nSo this is what the blood was for... Just as this thought flashed through Audrey's mind, she saw a white snowy storm.\nAmidst snowflakes the size of down feathers and a biting cold wind, a city that was more than 15 meters tall stood nearby. A soldier wearing leather armor on-guard by the gates was huddled in a spot that was immune to the wind and snow. As long as there weren't any merchant convoys, he wouldn't head forward to block any ordinary pedestrians.\n\"This... This is a world that was completely \u2018envisioned'... It's like it's real.\" Leonard looked around as he spread out his palm and caught several snowflakes. He felt the coldness of its touch before they quickly melted into water.\nAfter confirming the environment, Leonard suddenly realized something. Klein was maintaining the image of the cold and refined Gehrman Sparrow. Miss Justice wore a silver mask, revealing the bottom of her face, green eyes, and blonde hair, making it impossible to imagine her actual appearance.\nAs for himself, he didn't disguise himself at all...\nThis was a habit of official Beyonders. They openly carried out missions without any disguises.\nMr. Star really is laid-back, and his hair is combed very casually. It's such a pity. Otherwise, with his looks, he can be a model on the covers of magazines... As a noble lady who had seen too many handsome men, Audrey politely glanced at him before retracting her gaze without making any excessive observations.\nKlein chuckled inwardly and pointed at the city in the snowstorm.\n\"Our first target is the ascetic, Mr. Snowman, from the Third Epoch.\"\nThis was the person most likely to have a link to Amon and \"His\" brother!\nAccording to Klein's plan, after Snowman would be the fourth-generation aristocrat, Mobet. This was because Giant Groselle and Elf Siatas involved matters at much higher levels, and there was a high chance of there being an accident. Therefore, it was safer leaving them at the end of the schedule.\nAfter the exploration of the four people's subconscious via their dreams, they would then enter the sea of collective subconscious in search of any possible secrets."}
{"num_chp":830,"summary":"\"Exalted Great Master, your loyal and humble servant, Arrodes, is constantly at your service!\"\nKlein stood beside the bed and looked at the mirror before calmly asking, \"Where is the Antigonus family's notebook located behind Saint Samuel Cathedral's Chanis Gate?\"\nHe wanted to confirm the location so that he could directly head for his target and complete his plan in the shortest time possible. Through this, he could avoid all kinds of accidents.\nSilver text distorted and changed on the mirror's surface, forming a new line of text:\n\"It's a Grade 1 Sealed Artifact. It will be on the right in basement two. I can't see anything more specific.\"\nKlein tersely acknowledged as he said, \"It's your turn to ask.\"\nArrodes immediately dispersed the silver words and presented a new question:\n\"What other instructions do you have?\"\nIf this were any other time, Klein definitely would've secretly tsked, but his high-strung mind made him nod.\n\"Just watch over my illusion like before to deal with any accidents.\"\n\"Alright, Master!\" Arrodes didn't hesitate to give an answer as it hurriedly added, \"I-I will hold back my instincts. I swear to you, the great ruler above the spirit world!\"\nKlein nodded gently, took two steps forward, and made the mirror look like Dwayne Dant\u00e8s.\nThe image became clearer and bigger until it looked real.\nAfter some slight adjustments, Klein made it lie in bed as though it was already sleeping.\nAt this moment, he saw Dwayne Dant\u00e8s turned his head over and smile at him with a toady look. At the same time, he reached out his hands and pulled the blanket towards his head.\n\"...\"\nWithout a word, Klein transformed into the cold and crazy adventurer, Gehrman Sparrow, as Creeping Hunger on his left hand turned transparent.\nHis body rapidly phased away as he Traveled to the other end of Phelps Street where Saint Samuel Cathedral was. Following that, he walked to the square filled with pigeons in the day, and he hid himself in a corner under the guise of the shadows.\nA short while later, a batch of believers who had attended Mass came out of the cathedral. Before long, servants began leaving the cathedral with all sorts of miscellaneous items, walking to the trash bins in an alley. A number of people were dealing with the feces that was found at the spot where the carriages parked at.\nAt this moment, a servant's body suddenly trembled before he bowed his head. He seriously began cleaning the area, and he even proactively walked towards the square as though he wanted to clean the trash there. He slowly opened up a distance from the others until he came to a shadowy area.\nWhen the other servants stopped placing their attention on him, a hand suddenly outlined itself and reached out of the void, grabbing him by the shoulder and causing his body to phase away into nothingness.\nKlein had directly Traveled to a cheap two-bedroom condominium in East Borough. He had Teleported over a few days ago with another identity to rent it.\nA Traveler's ability is really convenient. The only problem is that I need to have a pirate sacrifice his life every time... Klein lampooned to relieve his anxiety as he made the servant lie in bed. Then, he took out a long metal vial and threw it at him.\nThe servant caught it and pulled out the stopper before gulping down the soporific medicine in it. In a few seconds, he fell into a deep slumber as Senor surfaced to the side.\nKlein observed the servant on the bed as his body suddenly softened like he had transformed into a slime monster.\nHowever, he didn't collapse into a pool. After some swaying, he instantly shortened his height by fifteen centimeters as his skin darkened in color. His facial features moved, and soon, he had transformed into the servant.\nAnd at this moment, Senor had already taken off the servant's clothes.\nWithout wasting any time, Klein quickly changed into those clothes and moved the items from the iron cigar case over.\nPicking up the broom and surveying the area before confirming that there weren't any problems, he made Senor return to the gold coin before Klein lowered his left arm and spread his fingers. He watched as Creeping Hunger produced an indescribable transparency effect.\nAfter teleporting back to the shadowy corner, Klein bent his back and began cleaning the area seriously. Step by step, he approached the busy servants but maintained a distance from them to prevent anyone from chatting with him which would increase his chances of being exposed.\nAfter about thirty minutes, the servants gathered together and entered Saint Samuel Cathedral and turned into a side door.\nAt a distance away from the priests, a servant stretched his arms and said, \"How tiring.\"\nKlein pretended to look uninterested in the conversation due to his fatigue as he tersely nodded without participating in the conversation.\nSoon, they returned to the servants' quarters. It comprised of two rather big rooms, with many bunk beds inside. Beside each bed was a wardrobe and chest.\nKlein was immediately at a loss. He didn't know whether to head left or right.\nThankfully, he was a Seer. He could solely rely on his spiritual intuition on matters that didn't involve Beyonders or mysterious domains. Furthermore, he was still holding onto a broom. Hence, he pretended to have his hand slip and secretly did a Dowsing Rod Seeking. He received a revelation that he should head right.\nWhen he entered the room on the right, Klein deliberately slowed down a little, observing the actions of the other servants. Then, he mimicked them by placing the broom in the region behind the door. Then, he went outside to the common bathroom to wash his face, rinse his mouth, and wash his feet.\nAfter he completed all of this in a slow manner, the bed that belonged to him revealed itself-the bed that wasn't occupied.\nLying in bed, Klein finally felt relieved as he secretly sighed in relief.\nThe servants were all exhausted and before long, they fell asleep, producing a symphony of snores.\nKlein maintained his consciousness and very slowly removed Creeping Hunger. Folding it up into a tiny shape, he stuffed it inside the iron cigar case, putting it together with Azik's copper whistle and Senor's gold coin.\nSeconds turned to minutes as he found it impossible to sleep due to anxiety. All he could do was rely on Cogitation to force himself to sleep for a few hours.\nHe woke up at a specific time and released Senor.\nThis marionette's cold aura rapidly melded with the surroundings as the Spirit Body Threads collapsed inwardly, gradually turning black without any origins.\nIt can still be controlled... Klein nodded indiscernibly and made the Wraith use the stained glass windows high above and the bright stone floor tiles to arrive at the staircase that led to the Keepers above.\nHe believed that if Senor hadn't been contaminated ahead of time, making Chanis Gate's core seal think of it as one of its own, it definitely would've reacted and cleansed it.\nHow could a Wraith have the ability to move freely in an orthodox Church's cathedral!\nAnd due to the \"tacit approval\" from the core seal and the disruption from the Paper Angel, the demigod-level archbishop that lived somewhere in the cathedral wasn't alerted!\nUnder Klein's control, and using the sensations from the contamination, the invisible Senor slowly walked to the second floor before turning left and finding the residence of the Keepers.\nIt's Monday tomorrow... This week's Monday shift is likely done by the Keeper I met first... Klein had long figured out the roster, so he made the dark-red coated Wraith stealthily pass through the wooden door and float into different rooms to identify the target.\nAs there were only a few people inside, he quickly found the pale elder with loose facial skin, sparse hair, and a big nose\nSenor immediately took out a sedative vial and placed it to the side. Then, before the Keeper sensed anything, it possessed him!\nThe Keeper, who was in deep sleep, lost control over his body before he could even wake up to resist. All he could do was open his grayish-blue eyes and watch himself slowly pick up the vial and pull off the stopper. Then, he downed the liquid inside.\nHis body convulsed abnormally as his organs seemed to be engaged in a violent struggle. After a full minute, he slowly went limp and closed his eyes again, entering a dreamless sleep.\nAfter doing all of this, Senor left the body of the Keeper and used all kinds of mirror surfaces to leap back to the servants' quarters before entering Klein's body.\nKlein immediately emitted a cold, dead, and distant aura. Even showing an expression appeared to be difficult.\nHe slowly got out of bed and silently left the servants' quarters. In the shadows and murals that weren't illuminated by the moonlight, he walked to the second floor and entered the target's room.\nStanding by the bedside, Klein, whilst in the appearance of a servant, slowly grew taller as his hair turned gray and sparse while his nose enlarged significantly.\nIn just a few seconds, he looked identical to the Keeper who just drank the sedative. Even his aura was identical.\nChanging into the black clergyman's coat that was placed to the side, Klein moved the Keeper's and servant's clothes underneath the bed and laid down as he kept note of the time.\nAt half-past five, he woke up ahead of time, finishing the white bread he had prepared the night before and drank a cup of water. He then looked quietly out the window.\nJust as day broke, Klein maintained his deadpan state and walked out the door. He went to the first floor, and following the path he had previously verified, he took a left turn.\nAfter walking for a moment, he wasn't surprised to see a priest.\nThis was his experience as a former Nighthawk; therefore, Klein wasn't too worried that he couldn't find the path.\nThe priest stood outside a secret door that led underground. As he raised his right hand, he tapped four times clockwise on his chest and said, \"May the Goddess bless you.\"\n\"Praise the Lady,\" Klein replied hoarsely and similarly drew a crimson moon.\nHe didn't stay any longer and walked past the priest. Under the lamps that lined the walls, he walked down the staircase and arrived at the crossroads.\nBased on his understanding of his environment, Klein believed that turning right would leave the cathedral, and it would likely lead to the disguised security company or other organization belonging to the Nighthawks. Therefore, he didn't hesitate to turn left.\nAt that moment, he saw a man wearing a Red Glove walk over.\nThe casually dressed man had black hair and green eyes with handsome looks. He was none other than Leonard Mitchell."}
{"num_chp":210,"summary":"In a Tingen suburb, there was a house with a green lawn.\nThe house had a garden that had begun to wither at the beginning of September. Attached to the house was a crimson chimney.\nThere was a desk next to the window in the bedroom of that house. An ordinary notebook was spread open on the table.\nA slightly pale hand flipped the notebook to the very first page, then it quickly flipped to the back.\nAs the paper flipped, the rows of words appeared faintly.\nRegence, a member from the Secret Order, sold the Antigonus family's notebook as an ordinary ancient book by accident due to the influence both of weariness and illusions. It was a coincidence that made logical sense.\nAffected by the calling of the Antigonus family's bloodline, the notebook secretly affects its owners, one after the other. After repeated changes in ownership, it came to Tingen. It fell into the hands of the members of the Aurora Order-Sirius Arapis and Hanass Vincent.\nAfter they flipped through the content that temporarily appeared in the notebook and copied the corresponding potion formulas, Sirius and Hanass were worried that the Secret Order, who were good at divination, would track them down. After discussing it, they decided to avoid the risk by selling it to another person.\nThey didn't wait for Mr. Z's reply; perhaps because he stayed at Enmat Harbor.\nThrough Sirius's introduction, Hanass got to know Welch McGovern from the Khoy University's Department of History. Then, Hanass sold the Antigonus family's notebook to McGovern as an ordinary ancient book.\nSubsequently, Sirius was attracted by the treasure that was said to exist on the main peak of the Hornacis mountain range. He started to visit the Deweyville Library and research the mountain. He didn't think that there would be any problems, so he left his real address and name. That aligned with his personality.\nDuring this process, he acquainted himself with Lanevus, who was reading up on information about iron mines to set up a scam.\nLanevus's hidden lunacy and swindling ability were well appreciated by Sirius. He decided to nurture him into a member of the Aurora Order. Of course, before that, an investigation was inevitable.\nSirius covertly informed Lanevus about the evil ritual of praying to the True Creator to deliver \"His\" spawn into this world. But he knew that the possibility of Lanevus succeeding was very low, because the difficulty level of the ritual was very high, and the requirements were very harsh. However, the latter expressed his strong interest in the matter, tempted by the possibility of obtaining a deity's approval. He planned to complete the ritual simultaneously as he carried out the plans of establishing his steelworks company.\nThe cunning Lanevus could tell that there was something fishy about Sirius Arapis. But for his personal goal, he didn't expose him.\nHe visited Hood Eugen in the asylum once again. They had known each other long ago, and they knew about their respective situations.\nAfter a dark divination, the Antigonus family's notebook was awakened fully. Welch and his classmate died. The lucky survivor, Klein Moretti, sent it to Ray Bieber's house under the influence of the notebook. It was a destined ending.\nMany rows were scribbled off and new content followed.\nFor some baffling reason, and a lack of sufficient explanations, Klein didn't commit suicide after that and somehow managed to stay alive.\nIn the Nighthawks' investigation of Welch's case that followed, he met Dunn Smith and joined the Nighthawks.\nAlthough it had already exceeded Ince Zangwill's description, it didn't affect the development of the story.\nBacchus and his brothers were down on their luck. They lost their last chip at the gambling tables and were drowning in debt. In a bid to obtain money, they decided to kidnap and blackmail the somewhat wealthy individuals.\nWhen they were looking for their final hideout, they chanced upon the room opposite Ray Bieber's apartment.\nBy then, Ray Bieber was already seduced by the power offered by the Antigonus family's notebook. He hoped to digest the gift left behind by his ancestors.\nHowever, he was in a semi-insane state, and he couldn't make the best and safest choice. He abandoned his dead mother, but he continued remaining in Tingen City. He only found a more elusive spot to carry out his digestion ritual. It was truly pathetic. If he had been slightly smarter, the story could've become even more complicated, but his decision was made based on his instincts and his poor state of mind.\nBacchus and company purchased weapons and took the youngest son, Elliott, of the tobacco merchant, Vickroy, and held him for ransom.\nFinally, they successfully carried out the abduction and took Elliot back to the apartment opposite Ray Bieber's. Vickroy's butler was entrusted with looking for help from a security company.\nBecause of Welch's mysterious death, security companies were short on hands. Klee chanced upon a deliveryman and happened to discover the existence of the Blackthorn Security Company.\nLeonard Mitchell and Klein accepted the job. Relying on their Beyonder powers, they quickly saved the merchant's son. Regrettably, Klein didn't immediately realize that clues to the Antigonus family's notebook were in the apartment opposite them.\nHowever, his spirituality reminded him in his dream. As such, the Tingen Nighthawks discovered corresponding clues.\n...\nSealed Artifact 2-049 arrived in Tingen. With the aid of the Antigonus family's puppet, Dunn Smith led the Nighthawks to find Ray Bieber before interrupting his digestion procedure.\nRay Bieber became a monster, and the situation was out of control.\nIn the end, the Nighthawks skillfully worked together and took care of Monster Bieber, but they immediately faced the attack of a member from the Secret Order.\nMore rows were scribbled away again, and the original content was impossible to read.\nLeonard Mitchell, who possesses a secret, was going to end the situation. Before he could, Klein, who was supposed to be doomed, killed the Sequence 7 member from the Secret Order in an inexplicable manner.\nThat didn't affect the development of the story. Dunn Smith got in touch with the Antigonus family's notebook and flipped through its content. From that point onwards, he was secretly tainted!\n...\nHaving finished with all his preparations, Lanevus beguiled Hood Eugen and used him to assist in his ritual. They tricked Lanevus's fianc\u00e9e, Megose, to become the vessel that would carry the True Creator's spawn.\nLanevus had almost no possibility of success. The most serious problem was that even though Megose would be protected by the ritual's power, she wouldn't be able to withstand the sexual intercourse with the illusory projection of a deity. It would cost her her life on the altar.\nAt that moment, the kind Ince Zangwill helped Lanevus in secret. He split off half a piece of a descendant of Death's characteristic that he obtained and planted it into Megose's body ahead of time.\nHood Eugen made Megose enter a semi-unconscious state and convinced her that the True Creator's illusory projection was Lanevus. Nourished by the accumulated resentment, gloominess, and oppression of the factory district, the ritual succeeded. Megose was pregnant with the True Creator's spawn. The deity saw through the coincidences, but since \"He\" wished to break through the shackles placed on him by the seven deities, \"He\" didn't refuse.\nHood Eugen was contaminated.\nAfter the ritual succeeded, the mad Lanevus regained his rationality. He clearly knew that if the deity's spawn was to descend into the world, Lanevus, himself, would become one of the sacrificial offerings. How could a mortal be the father of a deity's son? This was blasphemy of the highest order!\nLanevus decided to leave Tingen ahead of time and left clues to the Nighthawks, the Mandated Punishers, and the Machinery Hivemind so that they could resolve the repercussions of his actions. There was ultimately a price needed for lunacy.\nHowever, Lanevus didn't write the letter directly to the Beyonder squads. He thought it would make him look stupid.\nHe decided to leave the letter in one of the houses that he rented. He pretended to be playing a game with the Beyonders from official bodies. As such, he didn't bring up Hood Eugen's contamination and brought with him everything that he had obtained.\nJust in case, he informed Sirius Arapis in the safest way he could. The latter didn't quite believe him, but he could faintly feel the possibility of success.\n...\nSelena Wood accidentally chanced upon the real magic mirror divination incantation from her mysticism teacher, Hanass Vincent.\nHer bold attempt was interrupted by Klein Moretti by coincidence. The latter successfully resolved this supernatural incident that might've caused serious casualties.\nThe Nighthawks then investigated Hanass Vincent who had recently been awarded. Therefore, Dunn Smith coincidently saw a clear image of the True Creator in his dream and suffered severe injuries.\nHowever, he wasn't contaminated because of what happened. That would've been noticed by the upper echelons of the Nighthawks.\nThe injury made Dunn Smith's contamination by the Antigonus family notebook worsen. His absent-mindedness and forgetfulness worsened, and he was getting closer and closer to satisfying Ince Zangwill's requirements.\n...\nMany rows were scribbled away again.\nSeriously unbelievable! Klein Moretti noticed Ince Zangwill's secret influence and saw the crimson chimney.\nTh-this is because he was reminded by the teacher from the Khoy University's Department of History, Azik. He possesses many secrets.\nBut even so, it's astounding enough for Klein to discover actual clues. It's unexplainable.\nRegardless of the reason, Ince Zangwill continued to act, and the story continues.\nKlein coincidently ran into Sirius at the library and had no choice but to kill him. Hence, the clues leading to Lanevus were abruptly severed, and the discovery of the problem was delayed.\n...\nKlein met Megose, but his spirituality stopped him from observing her closely. However, he didn't notice the subtle abnormality. That is logical. Our stories aren't made up randomly.\nHe searched for the red chimney, but he always opted for a route that didn't include his target. Maybe in another two or three months, when he was on the last batch, he would find the real red chimney house.\n...\nRows and rows of writings were scribbled away, more than all of the previous rows added together.\nDunn Smith's problem was alleviated! His condition obviously became better! He actually mastered the \"acting method!\"\nAnd this was taught to him by Klein Moretti, who found inspiration from Daly Simone and Old Neil's example. No-Ince Zangwill didn't believe that, but he could only change his original plans slightly.\nNew elements in the story came to play.\nAzik decided to go to Backlund in search of his lost memories.\nIt wasn't long until Klein and Dunn found clues from Hood Eugen.\n...\nIn order to ensure that Tingen City's Conservative Party and New Party would be in complete opposition, Madam Sharon, who wanted to vent the accumulated madness after her transformation, decided to take the risk and murder Member of Parliament John Maynard.\n\"Her motive wasn't strong enough, but she took action anyway. There are always times when people are not clear-minded enough, and she happened to be in that stage. Besides, she was confident that she wouldn't be discovered.\nMaynard's wife found the Blackthorn Security Company through the tobacco merchant, Vickroy. They didn't disappoint her, and they quickly found Madam Sharon's abnormality.\nDunn Smith, who possessed power that was close to Sequence 6, decided to take action first. He passed the Sealed Artifact 3-0271 to Kenley.\nWhen the two of them and Klein returned to Madam Sharon's residence, Dunn attempted to pull her into a dream to control her from a distance.\"\nIt was a good plan, but, unfortunately, Madam Sharon happened to have the statue of the Primordial Demoness by her side.\nHence, the Nighthawks' plan failed. Kenley reflected himself in the mirror due to his nervousness and saw himself.\nMadam Sharon was taken care of while Kenley died. Dunn blamed himself and consumed Kenley's Beyonder characteristic as he usually did. His digestion procedure was interrupted as a result and was delayed. As such, his mental state became unstable.\nUnder the circumstances, Leonard and Klein noticed the letter left behind by Lanevus.\nMegose received a baffling summoning and arrived at Zouteland Street. She entered the Blackthorn Security Company, and the baby in her stomach was at a critical point in its development. It couldn't stop her urges.\nDunn made a detailed plan, a plan that was right, but he made one mistake. If he steeled his resolve to Megose behind Chanis Gate, he would've stood a chance with the aid of the environment and the items present. If he wanted to wait for backup, he definitely shouldn't have just taken Saint Selena's urn out.\nUnfortunately, Dunn's mind wasn't in the right place due to recent events, and he didn't think of the most critical point. A diety's son would be able to feel the threat of the Saint's urn. Hence, it was triggered and started to absorb its mother's strength in a bid to be born ahead of time, even though it wasn't exactly ready.\nAzik was in Backlund, but he wasn't a Traveler, so he couldn't rush back in such short notice.\nA few rows were scribbled away.\nMegose became a monster, and the fight began. With the aid of the Saint's urn, Blood Vessel Thief, and two high-level charms that strangely appeared, Megose died and the deity's son was exorcized. Dunn Smith died as a result, and the power of Saint Selena's ashes was severely damaged as well. That went perfectly with Ince Zangwill's intentions.\nInce Zangwill didn't get a chance to showcase himself, but it didn't hinder him from achieving his goal.\nHe killed Klein Moretti, the fellow who kept disrupting his plans, and he took away Saint Selena's ashes.\nInce Zangwill set up a ritual with the remaining half of the characteristic of Death's descendant. He consumed Saint Selena's ashes and successfully advanced from Sequence 5 of the Death Sequence pathway, Gatekeeper, to Sequence 4 of the Evernight Sequence pathway, Nightwatcher. As such, he received godhood characteristics and became a Demigod.\nThe sun continues to shine brilliantly on the land. Nearly no one in Tingen City realized how they narrowly escaped a huge disaster. Monster Ademisaul would be left very confused about it.\nThe notebook was flipped to the last page. A middle-aged man that was holding onto the book had dark blond hair, a dark blue eye that was nearly black, a tall nose, and tightly pursed lips. His facial features were like that of a statue and didn't have a single wrinkle. He held a classic quill with his slightly pale hand and wrote a line clearly without dipping into any ink.\nHe ended with a simple sentence.\nTingen's story ends here.\nThe papers rustled as he closed the book, leaving only a brown cover."}
{"num_chp":1360,"summary":"After Klein wrote down his impression of Tingen, he briefly mentioned that he had completed the ritual to become a Sequence 1 Attendant of Mysteries, as well as resolve one of his long-time traumas-the leader of the Secret Order, Zaratul.\nHe didn't describe his predicament in detail, only seriously discussing the mental problems that angels\nsuffered. Putting away the fountain pen and folding the paper, Klein reached out to take out Azik's copper whistle from Sefirah Castle and blew at it.\nInside the cheap coffee shop, white bones spewed out like fountains, forming a huge messenger.\nThe messenger then shrank his body, becoming only the height of a normal person.\nAt the same time, it knelt down on one knee and stretched out its palm.\n\"There's no need to be afraid of me.\" Upon seeing this, Klein laughed. \"It's not like I would do anything to\nyou?\" As he spoke, he picked up the letter and placed it in the skeleton messenger's hand.\nThe messenger nodded heavily a few times; it was unknown what it was agreeing with.\nThen, its body disintegrated, turning into bones that drilled into the ground.\nAt this moment, the boss brought coffee, oatmeal bread, and mutton stewed with peas.\nAs Klein enjoyed breakfast that wasn't too delicious but was filled with a bourgeois style, he looked out the window and enjoyed the morning scenery without any reason. He admired the pedestrians, carriages, trees, mist, food, and machinery that made up the scene.\nIf there was no apocalypse, it's best to be a Sequence 7 Beyonder to maintain the life in Tingen and live rather leisurely while being capable of handling most cases. When prepared, a Magician, who has many tricks up his sleeve, won't appear too weak when facing Sequence 6 and Sequence 5 Beyonders. As for Faceless and Marionettist, one can easily get lost while acting. It's relatively easy to lose control when one advances, making it rather dangerous. Of course, if one has a sealed Creeping Hunger, it would be perfect\u2022\u2022\u00b7 Klein casually thought as he recalled Creeping Hunger which had landed in Amon's hands.\nHe didn't know how Amon would treat this Sealed Artifact, but he only felt that an item of this level was of no value to an Angel of Time. After playing for a while, \"He\" would probably throw it into a secret \"warehouse\" in the darkness.\nI wonder if there's a chance to retrieve it. Just as this thought flashed through Klein's mind, he suddenly felt a little guilty.\nThis was because even if he could snatch Creeping\nHunger back from Amon's hands, he would throw it into the junk pile, making it wait to be bestowed to the\nBlessed or believers that needed it.\nThis was no different from being in Amon's hands.\nKlein quickly diverted his attention. I lost the mirror again.\nAdam shouldn't be interested in a mirror at the saint level. Perhaps, I can get it back...\nNo, Arrodes seems to have been spewed out from the Chaos Sea. In certain matters, it's possible that it can be a medium... Sigh, I only hope that Adam doesn't damage it, and that I have the time to retrieve it...\nAfter becoming an Attendant of Mysteries and gaining a deeper control of Sefirah Castle, Klein already possessed a certain level of authority in the \"Concealment\" domain.\nWhenever he was thinking about important matters, there would always be a thin shadow around him that no one else could see.\nThis was equivalent to the embryonic form of a divine kingdom, the Realm of Mysteries.\nTherefore, he dared to directly think of Adam's name.\nAfter sighing, Klein suddenly recalled something and hurriedly got the Worms of Spirit on duty in Sefirah\nCastle, to \"Graft\" a certain area in the spirit world he fixed when he advanced over.\nImmediately after, he finished the leftover mutton and the last bit of oatmeal bread that he dipped into the soup. He finished the coffee beside him.\nAfter putting on his hat and standing up, Klein took a step forward and entered the spirit world that corresponded to Utopia.\nThen, he removed the \"Grafting\" and returned to the ruins of Utopia.\nThis was to use the abilities of \"Grafting\" and his ability to freely enter the spirit world to indirectly achieve a \"Teleportation\" effect. Of course, the prerequisite was that he could locate the corresponding region in the spirit world. On this point, as the owner of Sefirah Castle, Klein had a unique advantage. As for Zaratul and the other Attendants of Mysteries, they could only rely on \"Their\" preparations.\nAs soon as he stepped into the ruins of Utopia, Klein surveyed the area and discovered that the collapsed houses and charred corpses were shimmering with different colors.\nThey were the Beyonder characteristics inside the monster marionettes, the wealth accumulated by Klein back in the Forsaken Land of the Gods.\nThis might be useless to him, but he still had many believers and Blessed that would gradually increase in numbers. As a \"deity,\" he had to stock up some\nBeyonder characteristics in order to bestow them.\nThankfully, the Lord of Storms didn't take the opportunity to sweep them away.-. As Klein silently muttered to himself, he couldn't help but thank Leodero.\nEast Chester County, inside the Hall family manor.\nAfter the sun finally rose, the suffering people returned to their rooms one after another to make up for their lack of sleep. Only Alfred, Earl Hall's personal bodyguards, the deacons, and Nighthawks sent by the Church of Evernight to investigate the reason behind the incident last night remained.\nAs Audrey used the golden retriever, Susie, to monitor the development of the situation, she opened her bedroom door and walked in.\nThrough the curtains and the weak sunlight in the room, a figure sat quietly on a high stool like a large doll.\nIt was a huge, snow-white rabbit.\nAudrey's brows twitched as she whispered, \"Mr. Wrath.\"\nThis was Mr. Wrath from the Psychology Alchemists that had pursued the mind dragon, Ariehogg. It was suspected to be one of Hermes's identities.\nAs she spoke, Audrey reached out her hand and closed the door.\nAnd with this action, the back of her hand flashed with a star-like crimson tattoo.\n\"I'm sorry; I made use of you.\" When the door closed, the giant white rabbit took the initiative to say,\n\"However, I might have been used by someone else as well.\"\nAudrey thought of the opening of the doors and windows in the middle of the night and took two steps forward. She replied in thought, \"There's no need to apologize. Just don't disturb me in the future.\"\nShe was tactfully expressing that she wanted to leave the Psychology Alchemists, hoping that no one would come looking for her again.\nThe huge white rabbit stared at her with its bright red eyes for a few seconds and said, \"Your previous wish was to protect your parents and family, but don't you think that you've been embroiled in too much trouble? The danger that you've brought them is greater than the help you provide?\"\nAudrey fell silent. She didn't speak for a long time.\n\"Normally speaking, a saint can indeed allow the family and family to gain more safety, but the premise is that they do not involve themselves in the struggle\nbetween angels or deities. Or perhaps, they are part of a powerful organization that can be relied on in the true sense of the word.\" Upon saying this, the huge white rabbit slowly said, \"I have two gifts to express my apology. You can choose one.\"\n\"Two?\" Audrey asked in a low voice. The giant white rabbit nodded, its ears constantly wiggling.\n\"One is to truly become Miss Pride of the Psychology Alchemists. We can ignore all your other secrets and tacitly allow your other operations-as long as you don't reveal our matters and bring danger to the Psychology Alchemists. Of course, there will be a certain disadvantage. You will shoulder the burden of certain matters and might be embroiled in quite a bit of trouble.\nThe only difference is that you will receive a lot of help and be rescued in time.\"\n\"What about the second one?\" Audrey had no intention of getting compensation from the Psychology Alchemists. To not have the secret organization disturb her again was the best form of apology.\nFurthermore, she suspected that Mr. Wrath's true intention behind \"His\" apology was just another form of exploitation.\nThe huge white rabbit answered calmly, \"I can help you divide another identity for you so that \u2018she' can stay by your family and provide them with some protection and emotional comfort. As for you, you will stay away from them and live on in this world with another identity.\n\"This way, your troubles will not affect the people you want to protect.\n\"In the supernatural world, under certain circumstances, distancing yourself is the best form of love and protection.\" Audrey fell silent once again as her green eyes seemed like a still lake.\n\"You don't need to answer me at once. Or you can combine the two methods.\" The giant white rabbit got off the high stool and stood up. \"You know how to get into the Garden of Eden.\"\nAs it spoke, its figure gradually disappeared into the sea of collective subconscious.\nBayam, in a room in the Church of the Sea God.\nThe Oracle, Danitz, dressed in a gorgeous robe, sat on a chair, silently looking at Alger Wilson.\nThe sleepiness from waking up in the middle of the night was gone from the fright.\nThe cardinal of the Church of Storms actually wanted to defect to the Church of the Sea God!\nThis was a huge matter in the field of religion, in the\nworld of mysticism and international politics!\nEven though he only had a rough understanding of the Church of Storms, Danitz believed that with their style in handling matters, they definitely wouldn't let\nthis matter go. Perhaps a calamity was already on its\nway to the entire Rorsted Archipelago to destroy it.\nFurthermore, a cardinal is definitely highly valued\nby the Lord of Storms. Alger's betrayal might attract a god's punishment at any time... The more Danitz thought about it, the more he trembled, afraid that he would be affected.\nThis made him recall a saying from his hometown: \"Don't be near people abandoned by the gods.\"\nThis was because those guys might get implicated when lightning smote down.\nIf not for the fact that Gehrman Sparrow had sent me a message in the name of being Mr. Fool's attendant to help me settle Alger Wilson in, I would've already tied up this ticking bomb and sent him back to the Church of the Lord of Storms... The more afraid Danitz was, the more he couldn't help but mutter inwardly.\nOf course, he was just letting his thoughts run wild. He didn't even consider their difference in strength.\nAfter a while, someone knocked on his door.\nDanitz jumped up and quickly walked to the door,\nopening a crack.\n\"Any results?\" he asked in a low voice.\nThe intel supervisor of the Church of the Sea God\nsaid simply, \"Lord Oracle, the Church of Storms has\nswitched cardinals.\"\n\"What about the original one?\" Danitz pressed in surprise.\n\"It's said that he was transferred back to their\nheadquarters,\" the intel supervisor recounted what he\nlearned from some of the servants at the Cathedral of Waves.\nTransferred back to their headquarters... As Danitz was confused, a grayish-white fog suddenly appeared in front of him.\nHe heard Mr. Fool's words:\n\"From this day forth, Alger shall wear a mask and become the pontiff of the Church of the Sea God.\""}
{"num_chp":120,"summary":"\"There is the presence of supernatural factors...\" Klein's eyes returned to normal, and he looked at Leonard and Frye.\nLeonard suddenly chuckled.\n\"Very professional, and deserving of the title of Seer.\"\nAre you trying to hint at something...Klein muttered in his head.\nFrye opened his suitcase and took out a silver knife and other tools. He paused and asked, \"The corpse tells me that she really died of a sudden heart attack. Do you have any way to divine a more detailed answer?\"\nKlein nodded seriously and said, \"I can attempt to combine a mediumship ritual and a dream divination. Hopefully, I'll be able to obtain something from Mrs. Lauwis's remaining spirituality.\"\nFrye maintained his cold and reserved state. He took two steps back and said, \"Give it a try.\"\nHe turned his head sideways and looked at Klein. He suddenly sighed without much fluctuation in his tone. \"You're getting more and more used to this kind of situation.\"\nIt's not like I wanted it...Klein had an urge to cry. He then took out the bottles of pure dew, essential oils, and herbal powder. Then, he quickly set up the mediumship ritual.\nHe chanted the honored titles of the Evernight Goddess in the middle of the spirituality wall and recited his prayers in Hermes.\nSoon, wind spun around him and the light grew dimmer.\nKlein's eyes turned entirely black, and he repeated the divination statement, \"The cause of Mrs. Lauwis's death.\n\"The cause of Mrs. Lauwis's death.\"\n...\nHe entered the dreamland whilst standing and \u2018saw' a translucent spirit lingering around the corpse.\nThen, he extended his illusory right hand to touch Mrs. Lauwis's remaining spirituality.\nIn an instance, light burst out in front of him as scenes flashed past, one after another.\nThere was a skinny and sallow lady dressed in ragged clothes, busily making matchboxes.\nShe suddenly paused and held her chest.\nShe was speaking to her two children.\nHer body wavered as she gasped for air.\nShe was buying black bread when someone suddenly patted her.\nShe was having the symptoms of a heart attack again and again.\nShe was feeling weary and got into bed, but she never woke up ever again.\nKlein observed every single detail, intending to look for a trace of the supernatural factor. But when everything ended, he still hadn't gained any clues. As the blurriness shattered, Klein left the dreamland and returned to reality.\nHe dispelled the wall of spirituality and said to the waiting Frye and amused Leonard,\n\"There were no direct symptoms. Most of the scenes revealed that Mrs. Lauwis had a heart ailment a long time ago. The only scene that was different was when Mrs. Lauwis was patted on the back by someone. The hand was fair and slender, apparently a woman's.\"\n\"For such a family, they wouldn't go to a doctor unless they're very, very sick. Even if they were to queue at a free charity hospital, time is not something they can afford to lose. A day without work might mean no food on the table the next day.\" Leonard sighed emotionally like a poet.\nFrye looked at the corpse on the bed and sighed lightly.\nBefore Klein spoke, Leonard quickly got out of his pensive state and said thoughtfully, \"Are you implying that the supernatural factor came into play when Mrs. Lauwis was patted? It came from the slender hand of a lady or madam?\"\nKlein nodded and replied, \"Yes, but this is merely my interpretation. Divination is always unclear.\"\nThe conversation ended. He and Leonard stepped back to the other side of the bed and allowed Frye to take out his tools from his suitcase without any disturbance, so he could do a further examination.\nAfter Frye was done, they waited as he packed up his tools. After cleaning up and covering the corpse, he turned around and said, \"Her death was caused by a natural heart disease. There's no doubt about it.\"\nUpon hearing the conclusion, Leonard paced back and forth. He even walked to the side of the door, paused for quite a while before saying, \"That's it for now. Let's head over to the workhouse in West Borough. We'll see if we can find other clues. Maybe we can link the two incidents together.\"\n\"Okay, we can only hope,\" Klein agreed, still filled with puzzlement.\nFrye picked up his suitcase and while skipping and walking, he carefully went across the two floor mattresses without stepping on anyone's blanket.\nLeonard opened the door and walked out of the room first. He told Lauwis and the tenant, \"You can return home now.\"\nKlein thought for a moment before adding, \"Don't be in a hurry to bury the body. Wait for another day, as there might be one more thorough examination.\"\n\"A-alright, Officer.\" Lauwis bowed lightly and replied in a hurry. Then, feeling numbed and lost, he said, \"A-actually, I... I don't have the money to bury her just yet. I have to save for another few days, just a few more days. Luckily, the weather is turning cold.\"\nKlein was shocked and asked, \"You plan on letting the corpse remain in the room for a few days?\"\nLauwis forced a smile and replied, \"Yea, thankfully, the weather became colder recently. I can move the body onto the table at night. When we eat, I can carry her to the bed...\"\nBefore he finished what he had to say, Frye suddenly interrupted, \"I've left you money for the burial next to your wife.\"\nAfter saying those words in absolute calmness, he exited the apartment directly, unbothered by Lauwis's shocked expression and gratitude that followed.\nKlein followed closely and thought of a question.\nIf the weather was still as hot as June or July, how would Lauwis deal with his wife's corpse?\nPick a very dark night with strong winds, throw the corpse into the Tussock River or the Khoy River? Or just dig a hole and bury her?\nKlein knew that the law requiring a cemetery burial had been established more than a thousand years ago, at the end of the previous Epoch. The seven major churches and imperial households from each country had approved the law in order to cut down on the number of water ghosts, zombies, and restless wraiths.\nEach country provided free land, while each church was in charge of keeping watch and patrolling. They only charged minimum fees for cremation and burial in order to pay for the necessary labor force.\nBut even so, the truly poor still couldn't afford it.\nAfter leaving 134 Iron Cross Street at Lower Street, the three Nighthawks and Bitsch Mountbatten parted ways. Silently, they took a turn to the nearby workhouse in West Borough.\nAs they got closer, Klein saw a long queue. It was just like when the people from the Foodaholic Empire on earth queued for a shop that gone viral on the Internet. The place was packed.\n\"There's about a hundred, no, closer to two hundred,\" he muttered in surprised. He saw the people queuing were in tattered clothes with numb expressions. They only occasionally looked towards the door of the workhouse impatiently.\nFrye slowed down and said coldly, \"There is a limit to the number of homeless poor each workhouse will accept daily. They can only take them in based on the queue order. Of course, the workhouse will examine and refuse entry to those who fail to meet the criteria.\"\n\"The economic recession in the recent months has played a part too...\" Leonard sighed.\n\"Those who don't manage to queue will have to figure out a way of their own?\" Klein asked subconsciously.\n\"They can also try their luck in the other workhouses. Different workhouses have different operating hours. However, each one has the same long line. Some of them would wait from two in the afternoon.\" Frye paused. \"The rest of the people mostly starve for a day. Then, they lose their ability to find a job and fall into a vicious cycle that leads directly to death. Those who can't withstand the hardship end up losing their struggle to stay on the good side of the law...\"\nKlein fell silent for a few seconds before letting out a sigh.\n\"The newspapers never publish any of this... Mr. Frye, I hardly ever hear you speak so much.\"\n\"I was once a pastor in a workhouse of the Goddess.\" Frye maintained his cold attitude.\nWhen the three of them arrived at the door of the workhouse in West Borough, they showed their identity documents to the doorkeeper, who was eyeing the queuers arrogantly, before they were taken into the workhouse.\nThe workhouse was transformed from an old church. There were mattresses and hammocks all over the Mass hall. The pungent scent of sweat mixed with the smell of Athlete's foot permeated every corner.\nIn and out of the hall, there were many poor families. Some swung hammers to break rocks, some picked oakum; no one was free.\n\"In order to not let poor people rely too much on workhouses and turn into scoundrels, the Poor Law established in 1336 enforced a rule whereby every poor person can only stay in the workhouse for five days at most. Any longer than that, one would be cast out. During the five days, they have to do manual labor, such as breaking rocks or picking oakum. These are the same tasks that criminals in prison do,\" Frye explained to Klein and Leonard briefly without much emotion.\nLeonard opened his mouth, and no one was sure if he was teasing or explaining, \"When they leave this workhouse, they could go to another one. Of course, they might not be able to move in. Heh, perhaps, to some people, poor people are like criminals.\"\n\"... Picking oakum?\" Klein was quiet. He didn't know what else to ask.\n\"The fibers of old ropes are actually a great material to seal the gaps in boats.\" Frye stopped and found a burnt mark on the ground.\nA few minutes later, the director and pastor of the workhouse rushed over. They were both men in their forties.\n\"Salus started the fire here and only burnt himself to death?\" Leonard asked, pointing at the ashen mark on the ground.\nThe director of the workhouse was a man with a broad, bumpy forehead. He scanned the area where Inspector Mitchell was pointing with blue eyes and nodded in affirmation.\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Before that, did Salus act strangely in any way?\" Klein asked.\nThe director of the workhouse thought and said, \"According to the person that slept next to him, Salus had been chanting \u2018The Lord has given up on me', \u2018The world is too filthy', \u2018I have nothing left', stuff along those lines. He was filled with resentment and hopelessness. But no one expected him to break all the kerosene lamps and start a fire to burn the place down while everyone was sleeping. Thank the Lord, someone found out in time and stopped his wicked act.\"\nKlein and Leonard then found a few people who had slept next to Salus the night before, and they also found the guard that stopped the tragedy. However, those people didn't have anything new to tell them.\nOf course, they used Spirit Vision, divination, and other methods to check if any of the people were lying or misleading them.\n\"It seems that Salus long had the idea to take revenge and self-destruct. It seems to be a very normal case.\" Leonard waited till the director and the pastor left to express his opinion.\nKlein pondered and said, \"My divination tells me that a supernatural factor had influenced this case.\"\n\"Let's eliminate Salus's fire case temporarily,\" Leonard concluded.\nJust then, Frye suddenly said, \"No, maybe there is another possibility. For example, Salus acted at the instigation of someone else, a Beyonder who didn't take any supernatural measures.\"\nKlein's eyes lit up as he echoed, \"It's very possible, such as the Instigator from before!\"\nInstigator Tris!\nBut that wouldn't have any connection with Mrs. Lauwis's death...He thought, creasing his eyebrows lightly."}
{"num_chp":520,"summary":"\"Hunt them?\" Danitz asked subconsciously.\nWhen he truly understood the meaning behind Gehrman Sparrow's words, he instantly became excited. He changed his seating posture and suppressed his voice.\n\"Is there anything I can help you with?\"\nAs a qualified, part-time pirate, he had nothing to do with beautiful words such as tolerance, compassion, and love. Since he had nearly died at the hands of Steel Maveti and now had the chance to take revenge, he definitely wouldn't miss it!\nHe believed that he could survive in the pirate industry by relying on an accurate grasp of the situation: knowing when to resist, when to fight for his life, when to feign ignorance when seeing his enemies, and when to settle old scores.\nAnd now, this was an opportunity!\nDanitz still couldn't make an accurate judgment on how powerful Gehrman Sparrow was, but judging from how he had taken care of the fallen Bishop Millet within ten seconds, it was unlikely that it would be too difficult for him to deal with Steel Maveti. Even if he encountered the Admiral of Blood, Senor, it wasn't impossible for him to win.\nOf course, this is in a one-on-one situation, and pirates never talk about chivalry...Danitz thought to himself.\nKlein leaned forward a little, placed his elbows on his knees, and clasped his hands.\n\"I've told you.\"\nAh? What?Danitz felt that he was often unable to keep up with Gehrman Sparrow's train of thought.\nWith regards to this, he could only console himself that a normal person and a madman were different.\nSeeing that the other party had stopped talking, he thought for a while and finally remembered what he had to do.\nWrite down everything that Admiral of Blood and his pirate crew had done!\nHmm... Gehrman Sparrow definitely wants to know how many things they've plundered...Danitz quickly gathered his thoughts, rummaged around the room for a pen and paper, and scribbled a chunk of text.\nDuring this process, he was exceptionally glad that it was his left arm that was injured.\nWhen he was done writing, Klein reached out for it, read it carefully, and confirmed from the undetailed parts of Danitz's description that Admiral of Blood was the most typical and vile of pirates. Not only did they plunder, but they also abducted people, slaughtered crew members, and abused women.\nA pirate like Danitz actually knows how to write Ancient Feysac... He's also been educated...After muttering to himself, Klein took out a copper penny and used divination to confirm the authenticity of the material.\nThen he said in a tone as though he was giving instructions on what was to be eaten tomorrow morning, \"Tell me about the Admiral of Blood and his men.\"\nHe needs more detailed information... Is he preparing to hunt them?Danitz was delighted, hating himself for not knowing enough.\n\"Admiral of Blood Senor is suspected to be an evil spirit. Anyone who has encountered him has died a bizarre death. Either they strangle themselves to death, blow their mouths up, hug bombs, or slaughter their companions. Captain said that it's the possession of an evil spirit.\"\nIt's very similar to Miss Sharron's Beyonder powers... Wraith?Klein didn't speak as he listened to Danitz go on, in silence.\n\"Senor can make a terrible shriek. The last time I fought them, I was nearly knocked unconscious and fell off the deck and into the sea. Heh heh, I returned the favor and set one of their boats on fire.\n\"Senor knows a lot of undead magic. Cruel, bloodthirsty, and full of desire. His targets can be either male or female, and even humanoid creatures.\"\nConsistent with the unrestrained nature of the Rose School of Thought. Yes, accurately speaking, it's a trait of the Prisoner pathway... The highest probability is that he's a Wraith...Klein nodded thoughtfully.\nIn response, Danitz became more active and spoke a little faster.\n\"Our Captain thinks that Senor has a very powerful mystical item on him, one that makes him very lucky. He always seems to gain the favor of the gods. For example, at a critical moment, his opponent would suddenly slip or have their powers fail. Another example is winning 21 bets in a row.\"\nA mystical item that can make someone lucky? This is very rare... It's from the Monster pathway? Or is it connected to some other evil spirit?Klein guessed based on his own knowledge of mysticism.\n\"I've never directly fought Senor, so that's all I know.\" Danitz wanted to throw his hands up, but he was stopped by the pain in his left arm. \"He has about seven or eight ships. His flagship is the Tree of Flesh and Blood. Heh heh, that's different from us. We mainly seek out treasure and wouldn't take in anyone. Therefore, we only have the Golden Dream.\"\nIt's no wonder the Admiral of Blood's bounty is much higher than Vice Admiral Iceberg, reaching 42,000 pounds... In terms of strength, he should be a bit stronger...Klein immediately gained an understanding.\nHe maintained the same posture as before, seemingly unaffected by the intelligence regarding the Admiral of Blood.\n\"What about his subordinates?\"\nDanitz was long prepared as he immediately said, \"Senor has ten of his strongest men under his command; the first, second, third mates of the flagship; and the captain of each ship...\n\"Steel Maveti is the second mate of the flagship. We think that he's a Sequence 6. His body is like steel and is able to withstand bullets and cannonballs. He isn't afraid of fire, drowning, and various magic. He's strong and fast. He can rip his opponent apart, and he grasps a certain level of undead-related spells. He can summon zombies and rear puppets...\"\nZombie?Klein immediately thought of Maric who played cards with zombies.\nBased on the Wraith traits of Admiral of Blood Senor, can it be assumed that these pirates are actually part of the outer circle of the Rose School of Thought, or perhaps they're from an organization used to make money? It's a pity that I don't have a messenger, nor did I ask Miss Sharron if she had one. Otherwise, I could contact her and confirm the Admiral of Blood's identity...Klein guessed with some regret.\nHe didn't give up just because this matter might involve the Rose School of Thought. In any case, he could change his face and identity afterwards. In addition, he had involved himself with the Aurora Order, the Demoness Sect, Rose Redemption, and Twilight Hermit Order, so he wasn't afraid of offending another entity.\nActually, it's not like I've never fought against the Rose School of Thought. I've already killed a Wraith, a Zombie, and a Wraith, and I've robbed the Scarlet Lunar Corona and Biological Poison Bottle...Klein suddenly realized how much trouble he had been involved in.\n\"It's unlikely that Maveti has any particularly powerful mystical items; otherwise, I might not have been able to escape before,\" Danitz said, feeling somewhat relieved at his luck. \"He has a bunch of puppets and zombies by his side, as well as several subordinates at Sequence 7 or 8. As the second mate of the flagship, he should be the leader of the crew in the vicinity since he's here. We can consider hunting him first.\"\nBelow the high Sequences, once the number of Beyonders reaches a certain amount, a qualitative change will occur. With the combination of different abilities, it's possible for a group to defeat a Beyonder stronger than themselves. It's just like how a Nighthawks team can definitely take down a Sequence 6, or even a Sequence 5...Klein didn't underestimate Steel Maveti and his men just because he was stronger with Creeping Hunger. He was still as cautious as before.\nI have to plan and prepare well. Well, the frequency bands and passcodes I received from White Shark will come in handy, and once Miss Magician's radio transceiver is delivered, I'll get Danitz to frequently monitor the frequency and see if we can glean any information, allowing me to go in quickly to reap the harvest... And I can take advantage of this period to explore the possibility of true acting...Soon, Klein formulated a plan as he continued to listen to Danitz tell him about the rest of Admiral of Blood's subordinates.\nAfter a while, when Danitz was finally done, he summarized enthusiastically, \"If Steel Maveti can be killed, leaving my name behind, this matter will definitely go on the papers. Once it's spread, I no longer need to worry about informing Captain!\"\nHe was afraid that a traitor was among their ranks and that all the points of contact in the Rorsted Archipelago were under the enemy's control. Therefore, he didn't dare to rashly make contact. He was still vexed over the problem of alerting his captain.\nHe actually has a brain...Klein nodded and said, \"You're in charge of gathering information on all aspects of Steel.\"\n\"Alright!\" Danitz replied with a grim smile, thinking of the punch that had nearly pierced his heart in the evening.\nKlein slowly stood up and walked towards the window. It was dark outside with howling winds and pouring rain. It looked as if the end of the world had arrived.\nThinking of what he was going to do next, he couldn't help but feel like he was acting in a certain sense. Smiling, he muttered to himself in a low voice, \"Tonight, Gehrman joins the hunt.\"\n...\nCity of Generosity, Bayam, in the Cathedral of Waves.\nAlger Wilson, who had received the Sanguine's anesthetic gas, was about to sail out to sea for another of the Wind-blessed's main ingredients, when he was summoned by the local diocese bishop.\n\"There have been rumors recently that Vice Admiral Iceberg received Death's Key. All the pirates in the Sonia Sea are roused by this,\" the bishop said in a heavy voice. \"Investigate this matter.\"\nHe was an old man with a head full of white hair, but he was still as energetic as ever. His speech was even faster than a young man's, as though he could charge out at any moment and personally resolve all problems.\nHis body was strong, his muscles bulging with his bishop's robe. The wind howled around him as he breathed, and the air was moist.\nThere are similar rumors every year, but they all end up being fake... Such rumors are commonly spread across the sea... Even if it's true, I don't have the right to be involved. There's no need to take the risk. I'll just go through the motions and skirt the edge of this matter...Alger muttered inwardly.\nHe solemnly clenched his fist and struck his left breast.\n\"Yes, Your Excellency!\n\"May the Storm be with you!\"\nDiocese Bishop Chogo was very pleased with Alger's attitude and returned the same salute.\n\"May the Storm be with you!\"\nThe encouraged Alger Wilson quickly left the cathedral and returned to the square outside.\nThe storm last night had subsided, and only the scattered leaves and water puddles on the ground remained as evidence of its coming.\nAfter taking a breath of after-rain fresh air, Alger decided to visit the few places where pirates roamed. He planned to put on a show of working hard by trying to seek out information.\nIf he were to meet a fellow with a bounty of a few hundred pounds, he wouldn't mind apprehending the poor bastard. In his opinion, they were liquid cash flow that could be added to his savings."}
{"num_chp":1245,"summary":"Boom! Boom! Boom!\nThe bolts of silver lightning that were as thick as an anaconda struck the translucent black velvet \"curtain.\" It shook violently as it distorted.\nTaking advantage of this opening, Reinette Tinekerr's figure, which was reflected on the castle's glass, jumped back into Klein's pocket and returned to the surface of the gold coin in the iron cigar case.\nThe prepared Klein raised his right arm and calmly aimed the Staff of the Stars at the floor tiles in the hall.\nA scene surfaced in his mind. It represented one of the Beyonder powers of a Druid.\nThe ground beneath his feet instantly softened, turning into a marsh. It made his body sink like it had fallen into a sea.\nUnderground Slink!\nBoom!\nThe translucent black velvet \"curtain\" could no longer withstand the cleansing from the lightning storm the moment the marsh solidified. It curled into a ball and fell back into the castle.\nNo longer restricted, the few thousand thick bolts of lightning rained down the ancient castle.\nA tower collapsed and the hall was left in shambles. One marionette after another burst into ephemeral illusions under the pricking of such a lightning strike. They were instantly charred black and reduced to ashes.\nWhen the silver light that illuminated the entire mountain range subsided, Dark Demonic Wolf Kotar's castle was in ruins. Many spots were burning with red flames.\nKlein immediately emerged from the bottom of a deep pit and saw that the demonic wolf, covered in dark and short fur, had performed the same action.\nRelying on the three Druids among \"His\" marionettes, \"He\" had successfully hidden underground to avoid the lightning bombardment.\nAnd at that moment, the independent \"kingdom\" created by the \"curtain\" had completely disintegrated. However, the Dark Demonic Wolf's wish hadn't completely expired. The return of godhood still needed some time.\nWithout any hesitation, both parties engaged in another intense battle.\nKotar allowed the crinkled \"curtain\" to fly up and drape \"Him,\" so as to prevent the Wraith's possession. After all, there were only three of \"His\" marionettes left. Of course, this way, \"He\" could no longer swap locations with his marionettes.\nAt the same time, Reinette Tinekerr left the gold coin in Klein's pocket and floated towards the eight-legged demonic wolf.\n\"She\" had given up on the idea of possession as \"Her\" arms suddenly swelled. A few strands of gray hair grew from the back of \"Her\" hand, and \"Her\" nails became long, sharp, and firm.\nWerewolf Transformation!\nThis doll-like baneful entity became a huge werewolf. \"She\" kept moving at high speeds, waving \"Her\" sharp claws as \"She\" engaged in an intense battle with the hill-like Dark Demonic Wolf.\nAmidst the clashing sounds, Klein was attacked by Kotar's three remaining marionettes.\nOne of them raised his head and roared, causing brown short hair to tear through his clothes. In an instant, he transformed into a terrifying giant bear that was twice the height of a person. One crouched down, pressing his palms against the ground, while the other raised his right hand and yanked his hair.\nAt that moment, a crimson flame surged out of Klein's clothes, instantly devouring him.\nHis figure appeared in a sea of flames to the side. Then, he jumped out, raised his staff, and charged straight at the huge brown bear.\nAnd at the spot where he was originally standing, dark green mutated vines pierced through the ground and grew wildly, stirring the remnant flames in the middle.\nTap! Tap! Tap!\nThe huge brown bear didn't back down. With heavy strides, it rushed towards Klein like a high-speed steam locomotive. It spread open its arms, trying to give him a \"passionate\" hug that could crush all his bones and squeeze all his chest muscles together.\nTap! Tap! Tap!\nAs his black trench coat flailed to his back, Klein didn't retreat-he was about to collide with the huge brown bear.\nSuddenly, he kicked his left foot and twisted his waist. He forcefully jumped up and flew past the brown bear diagonally.\nThud!\nAs the two crossed each other, Klein swung his black staff down and ruthlessly struck the brown bear's shoulder.\nNormally, such an attack wouldn't have been able to hurt the thick hide of the brown bear. However, with the Staff of the Stars, the physical attack would lead to random abnormal changes or strange effects.\nOf course, under the God of Wishes's suppression, these changes and effects wouldn't exceed that of a Sequence 4 Beyonder power.\nThud!\nAs the sound of the staff's strike reverberated, the huge brown bear's shoulder tore open diagonally from its shoulder. The bottom half of its torso \"teleported\" more than ten meters away while the remaining portion remained in place.\nThe brown bear's internal organs and blood gushed to the ground in a rather shocking scene.\nHowever, the brown bear wasn't dead yet. Its two halves were squirming as it struggled to stabilize his center of mass and continued attacking.\nAs a marionette, he had long died. Such damage was nothing.\nAt this moment, Klein had already jumped behind the brown bear, his feet stepping on the ground.\nAnother wave of scarlet flames surged out, drowning his figure.\nA flame that was about to be extinguished rose up as Klein leaped out and arrived close to the marionette which had both hands on the ground.\nWith his silk top hat, he ran past the marionette without turning his head as he swung the staff to the side.\nThud!\nThe marionette's body burst into golden flames as his figure instantly vanished.\nA flame surged into the sky as the marionette jumped down. However, the golden flames didn't extinguish, quickly burning him to ashes.\nWithout even looking over, Klein had already rushed in front of the marionette that was yanking his hair.\nThe marionette immediately threw out the hair in his hand.\nThese strands of hair began to burn as they emitted black gases, sounding alarms to Klein's spirituality senses.\nPoison!\nAn unknown poison!\nWith a creak, he forcefully stopped using his ability as a Clown. Using the inertia of his body, he extended his black staff.\nAll sorts of thoughts rapidly reformed in his mind, quickly forming a scene.\nBefore this operation, Klein had requested Miss Justice's help to hypnotize him. It made his brain unable to form scenes when he subconsciously thought of one. There would only be a single thought resonating in his mind, and he had to take the initiative to control it to construct the scene. This allowed him to use the Staff of the Stars for a long time without being affected by the negative effects. As for the flaws of thinking in such a manner, Klein felt that it was still acceptable under predetermined conditions.\nWithout a sound, the gems embedded in the Staff of the Stars lit up. A pure white and holy pillar of light descended from the sky, enveloping the black gas and the corresponding marionette.\nThe poison quickly melted under the Sun's burning. It was the same with the marionette.\nWith a remnant glow still in his eyes, Klein instinctively turned around and aimed his staff at the brown bear that was split into two.\nSilver lightning flashed spontaneously before the separated brown bear's body finally collapsed, unable to get up again.\nIn just a few seconds, Klein had finished off the remaining marionettes of the Dark Demonic Wolf.\nAfter Sefirah Castle's anomaly, be it him or the God of Wishes, time became abnormally precious. No one was willing to stall for time, because it wouldn't be long before high-level existences like the True Creator and Angel of Time Amon in the Forsaken Land of the Gods descended.\nUpon seeing this, Dark Demonic Wolf Kotar trembled violently and flung out the translucent velvet curtain.\nThe curtain first vanished into thin air before it suddenly appeared behind Klein. Just as his spirituality was about to send a warning, it covered him and wrapped him within it!\nKlein's vision immediately darkened as he felt his thoughts turn sluggish. His Spirit Body Threads were being inoculated onto the \"curtain\" one thread at a time.\nHe attempted using \"Flaming Jump,\" softening his bones, and using the Staff of the Stars, but he was unable to succeed in such an abnormal state.\nThe black velvet curtain became tighter and tighter, revealing the corresponding marks of his eyes, nose, and mouth, as though it was squeezing out a brand new \"person.\"\nReinette Tinekerr immediately \"jumped\" and appeared on the translucent \"curtain,\" purging it from Klein's body and teleporting elsewhere.\nThe Dark Demonic Wolf seized the opportunity and raised \"His\" neck, letting out a roar.\nThe \"curtain\" stood up, as if it had become a cloak draped over an invisible person's body.\nA terrifying suction force was born, causing the Spirit Body Threads of Reinette Tinekerr and Klein to uncontrollably float over.\nIf they didn't have the corresponding Beyonder powers, their Spirit Body Threads would've merged into the \"cloak\" in just three to four seconds, while they would become its marionettes.\nFortunately, Klein was a Marionettist himself. He immediately focused his attention and controlled his and Miss Messenger's Spirit Body Threads. He followed the method that he learned from Zaratul, allowing them to circle around him and return to their original positions, forming loops.\nRoar!\nThe Dark Demonic Wolf spat out a gas ball, sending it flying towards Klein like a cannonball.\nAs he was focused on controlling his and Miss Messenger's Spirit Body Threads, Klein could barely duck. Just as he was about to be struck, Reinette Tinekerr floated over and stood in front of him.\nBoom!\nReinette Tinekerr's blonde hair scattered as the evil vines wrapped around \"Her\" body broke apart.\nThe Dark Demonic Wolf's follow-up actions were one smooth continuous series of actions. Taking advantage of the moment when the \"curtain\" was desperately pulling at its target's Spirit Body Threads, \"He\" launched repeated attacks on Klein, forcing Reinette Tinekerr to block them. It caused the tough Ancient Bane to tremble under the attack of \"His\" claws, air blobs, and flaming attacks. More and more wounds appeared, making it look like \"She\" could not last any longer.\nAt this critical moment, as Klein controlled the Spirit Body Threads to resist the attraction of the \"curtain,\" he reached into his pocket and took out another iron cigar case.\nThe seal was removed and the box was opened. Inside, there was also a gold coin lying quietly. There was also a Wraith on the surface of the gold coin.\nThis was a blurry female wraith, a true undying creature, and not a Wraith from the Mutant pathway.\nIt was the strongest trump card that Klein had prepared. Previously, because he was inside the isolated \"kingdom\" that wasn't connected to the outside world. He was afraid that he wouldn't be able to obtain the desired effect. Only when the \"curtain\" targeted him and Miss Messenger did he feel that the opportunity was here.\nAs the box was opened, the wraith suddenly jumped onto the surface of a glass fragment. On it were nearly illusory black tubes that extended into infinity, connecting to the unknown.\nThis was the symbol of Artificial Death.\nAnd Artificial Death was equivalent to the Evernight Goddess!\nThis trump card of his was the reenactment of the time when the Evernight Goddess had used God of Glory Bladel's corpse to foil Amon's attempt to snatch Sefirah Castle.\nFor this, he deliberately found a wraith-like monster in the Forsaken Land of the Gods and imprisoned it, placing it together with the Artificial Death project's white feathers he summoned from the fog of history.\nThrough his repeated experiments and prayers during his specific trips to Backlund, this Wraith had finally established a certain connection with Artificial Death, allowing the Evernight Goddess to use this opportunity to exert a rather low level of influence!"}
{"num_chp":1114,"summary":"The forest that should've been engulfed in darkness and in decline was filled with the orange-red light of dusk. The light was intense and burned like fire, but it couldn't help but carry a sense of brilliance with it that couldn't be ignored.\nWith the Unshadowed Crucifix that seemed like pure light condensating in his hand, Derrick Berg slowly walked ahead. The grizzled Demon Hunter Colin, who was walking behind him to the left, held two straight swords in his hand. Haim, who was walking behind him to the right, held the Thunder God's Roar hammer. This two-meter-tall half-giant was prepared to switch the hammer for the Sealed Artifact with Derrick at any time.\nThe radiance emitted by the Unshadowed Crucifix became increasingly dim, as though the sun had already set in the horizon, leaving only a sliver of golden light.\nOf course, no one from the City of Silver had ever seen such a scene before. They could only use the descriptions from ancient literature to imagine it. Similarly, this was the first time they understood what a sunset meant.\nWhoosh!\nAs the exploration team ventured deeper, a wind began to blow in the nearly frozen Waning Forest. It was as if countless living beings were weeping deep within the forest.\nHowever, Derrick and company didn't feel any effects of the wind.\nWhoosh!\nThe sound of the wind intensified, making his heart tremble. Derrick suddenly felt a chill run down his neck, causing his hair to stand on end. His body and mind turned cold.\nGenerally speaking, it was human instinct to shrink their necks, raise their arms, and defend their backs at such moments in time. They would then half-turn their bodies, observe the situation, and be ready to attack. However, Derrick didn't do so, because in a dangerous environment, rashness would often result in terrible situations. Furthermore, he had the Chief and his teammate behind him. He had full faith in them that they would react in time; thus, he had handed his life to them.\nWith a swoosh, a silvery-white blade wrapped by a small snake-like electric bolt flew across the side of Derrick's neck, vaporizing a blurry and twisted figure into the light of dusk.\nAt the same time, the Unshadowed Crucifix was triggered by something. It suddenly broke out of its gloomy and dim state, making the light it emitted to once again become bright and pure.\nDawn seemed to come to the surrounding area immediately as indescribable black shadows began to show themselves in the light of dawn before quickly melting away.\nAfter everything calmed down, Derrick looked ahead and asked curiously, \"What are these? They don't look like wraiths, shadows, or evil spirits...\"\nDemon Hunter Colin surveyed the area and slowly said, \"A remnant aura of some sort... They seem to have combined with the power of dusk, causing a certain anomaly.\"\nI've never seen such monsters... Derrick tightened his grip on the Unshadowed Crucifix and moved his other finger, which hadn't been stabbed, onto the thorns.\nRelying on the Unshadowed Crucifix which was the nemesis of the evil around them, the expedition team proceeded rather smoothly. Before long' they arrived deep in the Waning Forest Through the trees' they could vaguely see a c\u8131 and orange-red clouds in the distance.\nThe damage here wasn't too serious. The branches and leaves remained suspended in midair, blocking the frozen dusk, making the environment darken.\nAfter carefully circling around the place, the area before Derrick's eyes suddenly lit up. He saw two grayish-white, mottled tombstones.\nBefore he could carefully observe them, the rays of dusk that shone through the gaps of the leaves had produced a strange refraction effect at the same time, interweaving themselves into a gigantic figure that was nearly ten meters tall.\nThis figure was very blurry and contained an everlasting and imperturbable air to it. It was like a reflection from a mythical era.\nIts skin was grayish-blue, and it wore silver-gray armor that seemed to be stained with blood. Its face was glowing like the setting sun, as though it was a manifestation of its eyes. Just its existence alone had caused the surrounding trees and the void to bend, making everything around it to begin waning uncontrollably.\nUpon witnessing this scene, a thought surfaced in everyone's mind without any explanation:\nGiant King, Ancient God Aurmir!\nGoosebumps appeared on the skins of the members of the expedition team-Joshua, Haim, and Antiona. Bit by bit, the goosebumps emitted grayish-blue colors. At the center of their eyebrows, flesh and blood were squirming, as if a monster was about to bore out.\nThey had collectively been put into the state of being on the verge of losing control.\nThey didn't even see the Mythical Creature form. Merely approaching the figure had led to signs of losing control as the severity of it increased.\nDerrick Berg was relatively alright because the pure light of the Unshadowed Cmcifix had enveloped him, giving him a warm feeling, allowing him to temporarily withstand the waning effect.\nAt this moment, Colin Iliad had already bent down. He held two swords that were smeared with ointment, and he ran towards that terrifying figure like a hurricane at high speeds.\nHowever, this Demon Hunter didn't charge in a straight line. His footwork was ingenious as he moved left and right, approaching his enemy in a zigzag-like manner.\nThe gigantic figure that stood in the twilight looked at everything with its sunset-like eyes. It seemed emotionless, like a statue carved out of stone.\nSuddenly, the glow on its face flashed.\nIt then bent down and heavily pounded its fists on the ground.\nBoom!\nThe ground shook violently as a fissure opened up. It made Derrick and the others lose their balance as they staggered and almost fell.\nAs for Demon Hunter Colin, he had leaped up ahead of time to a height of more than ten meters, and he cleaved downward with his two swords in a domineering manner.\nAt that moment, the figure that seemed to come from a mythical legend pulled out an illusory sword from the fissure in the ground. The giant sword that seemed like a manifestation of dusk itself was suddenly swung forward.\nThe orange-red storm of light suddenly took form and swept towards Demon Hunter Colin, as well as Derrick and company who were right behind him.\nWherever the light passed, the trees would wither and the soil would turn to sand. Everything began waning in an irreversible manner as a path was drawn out.\nBoom!\nThe twilight storm was blocked by invisible walls, causing the forest to shake.\nAt some point in time, Shepherd Elder Lovia had appeared beside Derrick. In front of him was a tall and illusory figure covered in silver armor.\nThe figure with a dark red glow near its eyes genuflected and stabbed an illusory greatsword into the ground, creating an unusually strong and invisible wall.\nBam!\nAt this moment, Demon Hunter Colin's two swords slashed at the nearly ten-meter-tall figure that possessed the aura of an ancient god, sending off countless sparks.\nThe silver-white figure didn't suffer any damage. The silver-gray armor that was covered in blood spots only dimmed a little.\nWith the force of the rebound, Colin once again soared up. He flipped in midair and launched his attack again.\nIn the Waning Domain, he didn't dare release his Mythical Creature form, because it was very likely that there was no way of reversing it.\nSeeing that the phantom that stemmed from a mythical legend had been blocked, Derrick hurriedly followed the sudden tremor and heat from the Unshadowed Crucifix in his palm, and he pressed his finger against a spike.\nHis blood surged into the cross along with the pain. A vigorous and bright light churned out, flying into the air and turning downwards, instantly enveloping the figure in silver-gray armor. His eyes were like a miniature setting sun.\nIn the holy, solemn, and pure light, the gigantic and illusory figure stopped moving, as if it had encountered its natural enemy, and the silver-gray armor that was tainted with the light of dusk began to melt.\nSeizing this opportunity, the evil spirit knight in front of Shepherd Elder Lovia pulled out the illusory greatsword from the ground. With several silver rifts that oscillated between disappearing and reappearing, they instantly struck the enemy.\nDemon Hunter Colin's two swords cleaved downward, as though they were emitting rays of the light of dawn that enveloped the head of the ancient figure.\nJoshua, Haim, and the others didn't hesitate to unleash their strongest attacks.\nAfter three rounds, the illusory figure that seemed to have transmigrated from time had finally begun to crumble, being reduced to burning orange dots of light.\nWhen Demon Hunter Colin landed on the ground, he deliberated and said, \"That should've been the remnants of the Giant King's will to protect this area. After many years of melding with the environment, it has a certain degree of strength and a form. It's a type of evil spirit.\n\"What secrets are hidden here...\"\nUpon hearing the Chiefs words, everyone cast their gazes forward, towards the place where the terrifying phantom had barred their way. The atmosphere was rather heavy.\nFortunately, it was only an evil spirit that was restrained by the Unshadowed Crucifix... It was just a tiny portion of its remnant will and had almost no strength left. After thousands of years, it's still as terrifying as ever. What would a real ancient god be like... Uh, why would \"He\" have such a strong will to protect this? Is it because it's where \"His\" parents are buried? As Derrick heaved a sigh of relief, he followed the Chief and company towards the tomb while being plagued with puzzlement and curiosity.\nPhew... There's no need for me to do anything... I have to say, this Unshadowed Crucifix really is very useful in the Giant King's Court. It's so good that I'm wondering if it's Adam's goal... Above the gray fog, Klein heaved a sigh of relief and lowered the Sea God Scepter that had been raised higher.\nHe then cast his gaze at the place where the Giant King's remnant will had continued protecting for over thousands of years.\nThe first thing he saw was two ancient mottled tombstones. On them were the words \"Father\" and \"Mother\" in Jotun.\nThey contained a mysteriousness that could stir the powers of nature. It allowed one to directly feel the mixed emotions of nostalgia, sadness, pain, and guilt without realizing that they were infected and making them feel depressed.\nBehind the stone pillar was a grave, but it had already been destroyed, revealing two black coffins underneath.\nIt was unknown who had opened the lids of the coffins, as though a confirmation had been made. This made the two grayish-white skeletons lying inside become bathed in the light that penetrated through the leaves, dyeing them with an orange-red color that resembled blood.\nThese two skeletons had the shape of humans. One was less than 1.9 meters tall, while the other was less than 1.8 meters tall."}
{"num_chp":1321,"summary":"The Fool Klein slowly surveyed the area. He didn't provide an explanation to everyone as they had expected. Instead, he reined in his sigh and asked with a smile, \"Where do you think the twenty-two Beyonder pathways originate from?\"\nThis was one of the three most important questions in mysticism, with no consensus for the answer. Every school of thought had its own theory; no one could convince anyone.\nCattleya deliberated for a moment before replying, \"The essence of the world is knowledge, and the essence of knowledge is data. Humans are data, and the Beyonder characteristics of the twenty-two pathways are data. All things are a form of data, and this is how it was born.\"\nShe had offered the Moses Ascetic Order's theory, but that was not her own point of view.\n\"The seven Churches believe that the Beyonder characteristic originated from the original Creator. \u2018He' transformed into all things, including the deities, humans, sea, land, and Beyonder characteristics,\" Leonard briefly explained. \"Of course, this is an explanation given to deacons and above. The official Beyonders below Sequence 6 don't need to know so much.\"\nThen, he glanced at Emlyn and said, \"The Life School of Thought believes that the world is split into three levels. The material world, the world of the spirit, and the world of absolute rationality. Beyonder characteristics are the projections of certain things from the world of absolute rationality into the material world and world of the spirit. Therefore, characteristics can't be destroyed. It only reassembles.\"\nFrom the looks of it, the world of absolute rationality that the Life School of Thought promotes might be referring to the river of fate... The Fool Klein thought of Will Auceptin, but he remained silent and didn't interrupt the conversation between the members of the Tarot Club.\nEmlyn returned a glance at The Star and said, \"As one of the rulers of the Second Epoch, us Sanguine believe that Beyonder characteristics do come from the original Creator. Then, the various characteristics accumulated and produced the ancient gods. The ancient gods then created different races.\"\nThis was the Sanguine's explanation for the First Epoch, and Emlyn already had some doubts about it. After all, he had encountered many secrets thanks to the Tarot Club.\nAlger nodded slightly.\n\"Although there are many explanations for the origins of a Beyonder characteristic, most of them point to the original Creator. The orthodox Churches, Aurora Order, and the City of Silver share such a belief.\"\n\"In other words, Beyonder characteristics originating from the original Creator is quite the prevalent understanding?\" Audrey asked thoughtfully.\nThe Psychology Alchemists mainly studied the mind world and the sea of collective subconscious. They lacked complete theories regarding the origins of the Beyonder characteristics.\n\"Roughly.\" Alger didn't conceal his views.\nAt this moment, The Fool Klein sighed and said, \"Not all of them.\"\nHe didn't proceed on to give a long story, but gave a rather vague answer.\nNot all of them... Mr. Fool means that Beyonder characteristics indeed originate from the original Creator, but not all of them. A small number of them are special cases? Is this the reason for the specialness of the Planter and Moon pathway? Alger instantly thought of a lot and grasped the essence of the problem.\nAs it had nothing to do with her, Fors continued listening leisurely. At this moment, she asked curiously, \"Honorable Mr. Fool, your meaning seems to be that most Beyonder characteristics originated from the original Creator, and the two pathways such as Planter and Moon are an exception. Then where did they come from?\"\nThe Fool Klein said simply, \"The Cosmos.\"\nCosmos... Emlyn was alarmed when he heard that. He realized that the matter might be more serious than he had imagined.\nThe Tarot Club had already shared the danger of the underground corruption and the cosmos. All of the members knew that these two concepts led to corruption simply from understanding it.\nWhen Audrey, Cattleya, and company looked at each other, The Fool Klein maintained his hint of a sigh and added, \"Not just these two.\"\nHe and the Seven Lights had always maintained their contact and had already confirmed that six of the Beyonders of the twenty-two Beyonder pathways belonged to Outer Deities.\n\"Honorable Mr. Fool, what other pathways come from the cosmos?\" Audrey habitually raised her hand and asked curiously and warily.\nThe Fool Klein replied succinctly, \"Prisoner, Criminal, Lawyer, and Arbiter.\"\nThe first two came from the Mother Tree of Desire, and the latter two, along with the Nation of Disorder, came from the Son of Chaos.\nChaos gave birth to order, and order came with its own shadow.\nArbiter... Fors turned her head in surprise and glanced at Xio.\nShe had just thought that this matter had nothing to do with her. She could only watch and not worry about it. Who knew that the trouble was right at her doorstep?\nXio frowned slightly and looked at the end of the long bronze table.\n\"Honorable Mr. Fool, I usually don't sense any abnormalities, nor have I received any divine epiphanies. Uh, other than those from you.\"\nThe Fool Klein smiled and said, \"The Arbiter and Lawyer are relatively better.\"\nAccording to his understanding, the influence the Son of Chaos had on both the Arbiter and the Lawyer pathway wasn't deep. It was incomparable to the Mother Goddess of Depravity's influence on the Moon and Planter pathways, and the Mother Tree of Desire's influence on the Criminal and Prisoner pathways. This Outer Deity had gone silent, as though \"He\" had disappeared.\nFors and Xio secretly heaved a sigh of relief. At the same time, they became more wary of the future.\nWith Mr. Fool not explaining further, Emlyn composed himself and said, \"The uniqueness of the Planter and Moon pathway comes from the cosmos. The divine epiphanies I sensed are likely a form of corruption?\"\nAlger looked at Mr. Fool at the end of the long, mottled table. Seeing that \"He\" had no intention of speaking, he nodded and said, \"Probably so.\"\nThis is a test for me... Emlyn sighed and said,\n\"I've already grasped the names of the High-Sequence potions of the Planter and Moon pathway. I'm somewhat puzzled about two of them.\"\nAfter becoming a Sanguine Earl and a high-ranking deacon of the Church of Earth, he obtained the corresponding clearance to access plenty of information that he had never been able to.\nSeeing the other members of the Tarot Club look over, The World Gehrman Sparrow raised his hand to pinch his chin. Emlyn thought and said, \"The Moon pathway is as follows: Sequence 3-High Summoner; Sequence 2-Life-Giver; Sequence 1-Beauty Goddess. The Planter pathway is as follows: Sequence 3-Pallbearer; Sequence 2-Desolate Matriarch; Sequence 1-Naturewalker.\n\"What I don't understand is that the names of the two potions-Beauty Goddess and Desolate Matriarch-have certain gender inclinations. What are your thoughts on this?\"\n\"...\" For a moment, no one from the Tarot Club spoke. They looked at each other and thought of a possibility.\nA few seconds later, Audrey controlled her gaze and said in deliberation, \"I remember that Sequence 7 of the Assassin pathway is called Witch. Assassins who consume this potion become Witches.\"\n...This is a test for me... Emlyn's lips moved slightly, unable to say a word.\nWhen he learned the name of the potions, he already had a certain premonition, but he wasn't willing to accept it. He hoped that he could obtain another explanation from the Tarot Club.\nDon't worry. You have a low chance of becoming an angel. Even if you can, you won't have the chance to be a Beauty Goddess... Klein mumbled inwardly, but he didn't say any words of \"comfort.\"\nEveryone fell silent. Leonard coughed and took the initiative to say, \"I'll share some matters.\"\nHe spoke at a moderate pace regarding Merlin Hermes, the rebuilding of Constant City overnight, and the Fully Automatic Wishing Machine.\nAs he spoke, he shot a glance at The World Klein.\nThe corners of Klein's mouth twitched as he made The World Gehrman Sparrow look ahead.\n\"I'll be leaving the eastern coast of Midseashire soon.\"\nEh... These were all done by Mr. World? Can he already create such miracles? As expected of an angel, a \"Him\"... Audrey recalled the information the Psychology Alchemists councilor, Mr. Gluttony, had shared. She was both surprised and impressed.\nShe didn't use her Spectator's powers to conceal her reaction. This was because everyone had expressed the same emotions, except for Mr. Star, who clearly knew about it.\nMerlin Hermes... Wandering magician... Fors noted the name deep down and secretly decided to distance herself from this name whenever she heard it in the future.\nThis didn't mean that she was still afraid of Gehrman Sparrow, but she knew something:\nIt definitely wasn't safe around Gehrman Sparrow. Something would always be happening in some way or another.\nOf course, an instinctive sense of fear was inevitable. It was just like how a seed of \"fear\" sown when one was young would remain even when one became an adult.\nGranting wishes for pleasure... Fully Automatic Wishing Machine... Is this The World Gehrman Sparrow's \"acting\"? Alger and Cattleya had similar thoughts simultaneously flashing through their minds. Then, they thought of something:\nEver since some time ago, Mr. Fool had made everyone pray to \"Him\" in the form of a wish before granting them.\n\"He\" is helping The World digest the potion, or is it that \"He\" and The World are from the same pathway? After \"He\" awoke, \"He\" also exhibits similar characteristics? Little Sun said before that Mr. Fool's actions were a miracle, allowing the city's residents to directly move from the Forsaken Land of the Gods to outside Bayam City... With the fact that The World Gehrman Sparrow is still acting, this shouldn't be something he can do... Alger nodded indiscernibly as he made a guess about the pathway Mr. Fool was in.\nAbout to leave the eastern coast of Midseashire? Then my investigation will be even easier. I can just come up with a simple conclusion. At most, I can just directly report that Gehrman Sparrow has become a Miracle Invoker and is acting... Anyway, the people who should know are already aware... Leonard mumbled silently and didn't ask further.\nAt this moment, The World Gehrman Sparrow looked around and asked, \"What do you know about the King of the Black Throne, Barros Hopkins?\""}
{"num_chp":333,"summary":"In the suburbs of North Borough, in a soon-to-be-abandoned three-story medical school building.\nEven at three o'clock in the afternoon, the fog and the clouds had already darkened the whole of Backlund, as if a storm was approaching.\nAlong the dilapidated corridor, the gloomy light shone in diagonally, penetrating the windows and causing everything to appear silent and scarred. It was eerie and terrifying.\nThis was Audrey's second time here, and she was no longer as nervous and tense as before. She turned her head left and right in her surgical cap and big mask, habitually observing the environment, observing every detail of this place.\nViscount Glaint was walking beside her and gradually turned apprehensive. He couldn't help but whisper, \"Why do I find that this place is a little strange...\n\"Could there be evil ghosts?\"\nAs a mysticism enthusiast who had only half a foot in the Beyonder circle, the only Beyonder phenomenon he had witnessed was Fors's passing through walls and the opening of a door. He was still unsure of the existence of wraiths and shadows.\nHowever, this didn't stop him from being afraid of similar monsters!\nFors turned her head and shot him a glance as she held back her laughter.\n\"Most of the participants of this gathering are Beyonders. If there really are evil ghosts or spirits, they would definitely be very happy. It usually implies ingredients or servants.\"\nNoticing that Viscount Glaint was obviously relieved, she purposely added, \"Of course, I'm only talking about the weaker kind of ghosts. A truly formed shadow might be able to kill everyone here without making a sound. And even if you run, all you can do is run back and forth between the three stories without being able to leave. It's like entering a maze.\"\nXio nodded in approval.\n\"I've once encountered a similar wraith. I ran in circles while in the cemetery without any means of escaping. During this process, there were baffled people who would turn their heads for no reason, only to suffer a sudden death. If not for one of the Beyonders carrying a sun charm, perhaps you wouldn't be seeing me here today.\"\nViscount Glaint shivered as he looked out the window. At this moment, a withered tree branch hit the glass and made a light sound as it was blown by the cold wind.\nGlaint almost shouted out loud, as he frantically inched towards the two Beyonders, Fors and Xio.\nAudrey resisted smiling and quietly watched this scene from the sidelines. In her heart, she thought,I have met Mr. Fool who is close to a deity. I know the City of Silver in the Forsaken Land of the Gods, I have heard of all kinds of terrifying monsters in the depths of the darkness. Why would I fear wraiths and shadows?\nHowever... I really haven't met a ghost yet. Pui! Audrey, what are you thinking? It's better not to come across this kind of thing!\nUnless I become a Psychiatrist with Beyonder powers capable of influencing other creatures, or if I obtain mystical items that can restrain ghosts and monsters...\nThe four of them couldn't help but increase their pace and quickly arrived at the gathering venue for the day.\nBefore she entered, Fors found an opportunity to bend her back and whisper into Xio's ear, \"You did well cooperating with me just now. You actually made up a story so quickly that's enough to frighten others.\n\"Look at the spots which aren't covered by Viscount Glaint's mask. It's so white that you can't see any colors.\"\nXio turned her head as she answered blankly, \"I didn't make up the story.\n\"That was something that happened to me before I came to Backlund.\"\n\"...\" Fors was stunned for a moment before she blurted out a question, \"For real?\"\n\"Why would I lie?\" Xio's puzzled face was obscured by the mask.\nFors turned her head and took two steps forward and suddenly shivered.\nAt that moment, Glaint didn't wish to stay in the creepy corridor any longer. He reached out his hand and pushed open the door to the gathering venue.\nAs the creaking sound echoed, he saw the concrete floor and the smell of antiseptic coming into his nose. It made him frown.\nSoon after, he saw a large pool in the middle. It was filled with a clear, yellow liquid, and there were floating figures inside it.\nSome of the figures were entirely naked. Some were rather complete while others had half their skin ripped off. They had the brownish auburn colors of beef jerky.\nThey were corpses!\n\"Ah!\"\nA man's shrill cry resounded in the room.\nGazes were instantly cast onto Glaint.\nThese gazes were all from the figures in white coats surrounding the pool. They were also wearing surgical caps and huge masks, and only their eyes and a bit of their skin were exposed.\nGlaint's body swayed a bit. He wanted to turn around and run away, but when he saw Audrey, Fors, and Xio pass him, as if nothing had happened, in order to enter his room, he realized that they were pretending that they weren't his companions.\nAs he took a deep breath, Glaint nearly vomited.\nHe looked outside and saw that the corridor was dark and gloomy, filled with shadows, and that there wasn't a single living soul in sight.\nWith another shudder, Glaint hastened his steps and caught up with Audrey and the others, finding a place to sit down as far as possible from the pool.\nAfter a few minutes, a figure wearing a white coat stepped out of the line and used a wooden pole with a hook on the side to pull a corpse to the side. Then, he directly dragged the corpse to the concrete floor.\nHe paused for about three seconds, took out a scalpel, and slit open the body's abdomen.\nAs the gash deepened, a cold and hoarse voice suddenly sounded from inside.\n\"Let the gathering begin.\"\n... Glaint reached out with his hand to press down his mask. His throat moved a few times and he almost vomited.\nThey were midway in the gathering with all kinds of trades-either a success or failure-happening, Audrey, who had been calmly observing all this time, finally opened her mouth and said, \"I want the Spectator potion formula.\"\nBefore she could finish her sentence, she felt several gazes sweep over her. However, they quickly moved away and didn't linger for long.\nAfter several seconds of silence, the transaction was aborted.\n...\nAround four in the afternoon, it was getting closer to night.\n\"Why was there nothing at all...\" Glaint didn't maintain his aristocratic demeanor as he slumped against the wooden wall of the carriage and sighed.\nThis Beyonder gathering had left a deep impression on him, making him feel as if he had taken a huge risk.\nBut even so, he was still unable to buy the horn of an adult Flying Unicorn and the venom crystal of a Royal Jellyfish.\nFors secretly pursed his lips and said, \"That's normal. Although Backlund is the easiest place to get ingredients, if you can't join every Beyonder gathering, there will still be situations in which you won't be able to find what you want for a long time. It requires either luck or patience.\"\n\"Mister Viscount, think about Miss Audrey's Spectator potion. She hasn't received any clues to date.\"\nSometimes, you can encounter the ingredients, but you would lack the money to buy them...Xio, who was sitting to the side, thought in exasperation.\nAudrey consoled Glaint, \"When I get back, I'll go to my family's vault and do a search. Maybe there's something you want.\"\nShe had brought the Rainbow Salamander's pituitary gland with her today, but she hadn't encountered the spinal fluid of a Farsman Rabbit. Therefore, she had only exchanged it for 320 pounds in cash. It was to prepare for Susie's advancement.\nGlaint nodded, and just as he was about to open his mouth, he saw Xio sitting up straight. She frowned and said, \"It seems like someone is following us!\"\n\"I trust your intuition. What do we do now?\" Fors asked, looking around.\nFollowing us? Why follow us? All we did was sell one Beyonder item and obtain a few hundred pounds in cash. Even if someone wanted to rob us, we shouldn't be the top targets... Although Glaint acted like a rookie, we didn't... In addition, the gathering's organizer had done a lot of things to ensure the safety of the members and to prevent anyone from being followed. Unless... the person who sent the tracker is the organizer! Last time, everything seemed normal. Hmm, what's the difference between the two occasions...Audrey's mind raced when she suddenly came up with an idea.\nPerhaps it was my request to purchase the Spectator formula that attracted the attention of the Psychology Alchemists.\nIt's impossible for them to randomly sell the Spectator formula, so what would inevitably follow is recruitment into the organization.\nAnd recruitment isn't a simple matter. One has to be wary of any quasi-Nighthawks or quasi-Mandated Punishers, or spies sent by other hidden factions.\nIf they don't observe the target and conduct an investigation, the organization would quickly be destroyed!\nAfter pondering for a few seconds, Audrey said to Fors and the others, \"Prepare to be attacked.\n\"Pretend as though you didn't notice the tracker.\n\"If we can successfully return to Empress Borough, don't worry about exposing the identities of Glaint and me. Both of you have to leave in secret.\"\nHer green eyes swept over Glaint and she added with a smile, \"A lot of people know that we are mysticism enthusiasts, so it's normal for us to find an opportunity to participate in a Beyonder gathering. Even if the tracker is an official Beyonder, they won't suspect anything. We are just regular people, so all they will do is warn us through other channels.\"\nBut I'm already at Sequence 8... Phew, in order to come into contact with the Psychology Alchemists, I have to take a little risk... It's likely the official Beyonders won't target me for seeking to purchase a formula. They shouldn't be able to bypass the gathering organizer and track us down. I want to believe in my own judgment!Audrey cheered herself on.\n\"Okay,\" Viscount Glaint mumbled as he agreed.\nThe horse carriage continued on as usual, going in circles a few times. In the end, Audrey and the others changed to another carriage as they had planned.\nThroughout this process, the tracker never attacked.\nWhen they reached the back door of Viscount Glaint's mansion in Empress Borough, the two nobles used their usual means of returning. As for Fors and Xio, they each relied on their own skills to leave.\nAbout ten minutes later, Audrey, accompanied by her huge golden retriever, Susie, and her maids, openly left through the front door, in her own carriage.\nAs she listened to the sound of rolling wheels, she was unable to confirm if there were still people following her. She could only let her thoughts wander.\nIt's obvious that the daughter of Count Hall isn't a spy of any Beyonder faction...\nThere's nothing wrong with her past...\nHer love for mysticism is well-known...\nHer status and identity can provide assistance that's different from other people...\nPerhaps, in two days, there will be members of the Psychology Alchemists who will try to come into contact with me...Audrey thought with some anticipation and some nervousness.\n...\nAlthough he said he was making preparations, Klein spent two days at the Quelaag Club as if nothing had happened. He even played a game of cards with the equestrian teacher, Talim, and the others, winning a few soli.\nBefore he went to bed, he didn't forget to visit the outside of Lawyer Jurgen's house to make sure if there were no lights and to feed the cat.\nAt eight o'clock on Friday night, he put on his iron mask and wore his black-hooded robe and entered the activity room of Old Mister Eye of Wisdom."}
{"num_chp":1276,"summary":"Upon seeing this scene, Katarina's body took a step back uncontrollably as her mind fell silent.\nTwo seconds later, she opened her mouth and let out a male voice:\n\"Hey, little raven.\"\nWithout waiting for the young man to respond, Katarina smiled and said, \"Aren't you looking down on me by bringing just a few avatars?\n\"Could it be that you're a mailman, specifically here to deliver me Beyonder ingredients?\n\"Tell me, what kind of cooperation do you want? I don't hate you too much. After all, what happened back then was planned by that zealot. The mastermind was Alista Tudor, and you can only be considered an accomplice.\"\nThe man opposite \"Him\" caught the crown that was covered in rust and blood. \"He\" straightened up and shook \"His\" head with a smile.\n\"I have my reservations in cooperating with you after hearing your voice. Why don't you get Sauron and Einhorn to talk to me?\"\n\"Tsk, tsk. It's been so many years, yet you're still as willful as a child. Do you still remember who was responsible for carrying you when you were still a baby? Who was the one who burned away your hair?\" The Red Angel evil spirit mocked without any compromises.\nThe young man opposite \"Him\" used \"His\" empty hand to straighten \"His\" monocle and calmly turned around before walking out the door without any hesitation.\nDuring this process, \"He\" sighed softly.\n\"Childish.\"\nSeeing that Amon had no intention of stopping, the Red Angel fell silent for a few seconds. Before the other party walked out of the room, it controlled Katarina's body and chuckled.\n\"Don't think that I don't know what you want to do, but it doesn't matter. Since you don't have the same thoughts as that zealot, then there's room for cooperation.\"\nAmon stopped and turned halfway to look at Demoness of White Katarina, who was possessed by the Red Angel evil spirit.\nThe monocle on \"His\" right eye seemed to glimmer slightly.\n...\nAwwa County, in a city that was being rebuilt after war, inside a bar which had burn marks.\n\"Toby, did you add too much damned water to your beer?\" A man wearing an old cap took the cup and took a sip. He couldn't help but complain.\nThe boss, who doubled up as bartender, wiped his cup and snorted.\n\"Do you still remember the alcohol ban from before? Oli\u0107, you should be thankful that you even have alcohol to drink!\"\nThe burly man, who was named Oli\u0107, murmured a few words before he focused on drinking his beer.\nBeside him was a bronze-skinned man with rolled-up sleeves. He looked up and surveyed the area.\n\"I heard that the alcohol ban will soon be lifted because Feynapotter's food will soon be sent over. Also, Feysac and Intis will pay reparations with plenty of food!\"\n\"I can only say that I hope so. May the Lord watch over us.\" The bar owner, Toby, had just responded when he heard the door open.\nHe looked up and saw a young man who seemed to be a wandering magician walk in.\nThis man was wearing a long black robe and a classic top hat. He walked to the bar counter and sat on a high stool.\n\"A cup of Southville beer.\" The man placed several copper pence on the counter.\nThe burly man named Oli\u0107 turned his head to look at the stranger and asked curiously, \"Not from around here? A magician?\"\nThe young man, who didn't have any outstanding features, laughed and said, \"Yes, the magic that I'm best at is to satisfy the wishes of people.\"\nOli\u0107 immediately whistled.\n\"What did I hear?\n\"To satisfy the wishes of people!?\n\"Lord, there's a fellow pretending to be a deity here!\"\nThis teasing caused everyone to burst into laughter.\nThe young man who claimed to be a magician wasn't angry. He smiled and said, \"That's just a special magic trick.\"\nOli\u0107 gulped down a mouthful of bland beer and laughed.\n\"Then fulfill my wish and let this stingy boss treat me to a glass of beer.\"\n\"Alright.\" The young man in a black robe raised his right hand and tapped lightly on the table.\nWith the glass slamming onto the counter loudly, the bar owner poured a glass of beer and pushed it in front of Oli\u0107. Then, he retracted his hand and repeated his glass wiping.\nThis scene that seemed familiar to him stunned Oli\u0107. He shouted blankly,\n\"Toby, you know him?\"\n\"No.\" The boss, Toby, glanced at Oli\u0107 like he was a fool.\n\"...\" Oli\u0107 raised the glass of beer with uncertainty and took a careful sip to see if Toby would make him pay for it.\nSeeing that the bar owner no longer bothered with him, the burly man turned his head in surprise and looked at the young man in a black robe and a tall hat.\n\"How did you do it?\n\"I told you that it's a special magic trick.\" The young man leisurely drank a mouthful of Southville beer.\nWhile Oli\u0107 remained in shock, the man beside him with rolled-up sleeves sneered.\n\"I dare bet that you and Toby must have colluded beforehand. Your knocking on the table is to say that you'll pay for the beer.\"\n\"You can make another wish,\" the wandering magician replied nonchalantly.\n\"My brother and I have a house that collapsed during one of the bombings and is being rebuilt. My wish is that it will return to its original state before I return,\" the man with his sleeves rolled up said smugly.\nThis wasn't an easy task.\nThe wandering magician raised his right hand and snapped his fingers before smiling.\n\"Alright, your wish has been granted.\"\nThe people who were paying attention to this broke out into laughter. They no longer paid attention to the foreigner and his clumsy magic show.\nAfter drinking, the man with his sleeves rolled up left the bar in a drunken stupor with Oli\u0107, and staggered down the street towards the suburbs.\nFifteen minutes later, they returned to the area where they were rebuilding their home. They were about to enter the tent that was issued by the government.\nAt this moment, a gust of cold wind blew and made them shudder at the same time.\nSoon after, a two-story building appeared before their eyes. It was a house that they were very familiar with and had spent years building.\nOli\u0107 and his brother subconsciously turned their heads and saw the same confusion in each other's eyes.\n\"I didn't drink that much... That damn Toby mixed so much water into the beer!\" Oli\u0107 murmured, as if he was seeing things thanks to his intoxication.\nHis brother didn't respond. After being stunned for a few seconds, he suddenly widened his stride and rushed to the house, touching the wall and the door.\n\"It's real, it's real...\" He kept muttering to himself as if he had gone crazy.\nOli\u0107 did the same thing. Finally, he confirmed that their house had been restored to its original state. This made him both surprised and scared.\nAt this moment, his brother suddenly said, \"My wish was granted. That magician, that magician...\"\nBefore he finished his sentence, he turned around and ran towards the bar. Oli\u0107 came to his senses and followed closely behind.\nBang!\nThey pushed open the bar's door and rushed in, casting their gaze at the bar counter.\nHowever, the black-robed and tall-hat wearing wandering magician had already left.\nOli\u0107 and his brother looked around. They appeared relieved, but they also felt like they had lost something.\nIn the square of the city, the young wandering magician was squatting in front of a ten-year-old girl.\n\"My magic is to fulfill your wish.\" He turned his head and glanced at the nearby Evernight cathedral.\nThe little girl had run out from the Evernight Mass, seemingly preferring the empty square.\nAfter some thought, she looked at the gentle Mr. Magician and said, \"My wish is for my father, uncle, and brother to come back to life. I don't want their bereavement money...\"\nThe wandering magician didn't respond as he gazed deeply at the little girl in front of him.\nThe girl pursed her lips and forced a smile.\n\"I was just joking. Mommy said that such a wish is not something even the deities can grant...\"\nAs she spoke, she lowered her head and looked at her toes.\n\"I just want Daddy to hug me again...\"\nBefore she could finish speaking, she suddenly realized that there was a shadow in front of her. She quickly raised her head and looked to the side.\nStanding there was a Loen soldier dressed in a red shirt and white pants. He didn't hold a rifle and was wearing a hearty smile on his face. He crouched down and spread open his arms like always.\n\"Daddy...\" The little girl pounced forward and threw herself into the warm embrace. \"I miss you so much...\"\nAt that moment, the young magician pressed down his hat, straightened himself, and walked towards the entrance of the square.\nAmidst the night breeze, his long black robe swayed gently in the vast plaza.\n...\nIn a blink of an eye, it was Monday. In the ancient palace above the gray fog, the members of the Tarot Club appeared simultaneously and greeted Mr. Fool in unison.\nKlein looked around and suddenly felt emotional.\nThe Hanged Man is currently a cardinal of the Church of Storms, and he's in charge of the Rorsted Archipelago diocese. Although Justice has temporarily lost contact with the Psychology Alchemists, she has the right to become one of their councilors. The Sun is an Elder of the six-member council in the City of Silver, and The Moon is a Sanguine Earl. The Star is a high-ranking deacon of the Church of Evernight's Nighthawks. The Hermit is a hidden queen at sea, one of the ten pillars of the Moses Ascetic Order.\nApart from The Magician and Judgment, the other members of the Tarot Club are all demigods. They are the upper echelons of different factions in the mysterious world.\nAnd with the support of the Abraham family, The Magician has a high chance of advancing to Sequence 4 Secrets Sorcerer within the year.\nIn other words, Judgment is the one who has the hardest time improving her strength. She is only one of the mid-to-upper echelons in MI9, so it's extremely difficult for her to become a demigod.\nKlein, who was shrouded in grayish-white fog, quickly retracted his gaze and laughed self-deprecatingly in his heart.\nIt's finally like a high-end secret organization... However, it always gave me the feeling that this is some conference between the various factions...\nHe then nodded at the Tarot Club members and said, \"Let's begin.\""}
{"num_chp":588,"summary":"\"It's you?\"\nUpon hearing this surprised and curious female voice, Klein jumped in fright, imagining that he had been recognized by someone.\nHe immediately composed himself because he had already changed his appearance to that of the deceased Vice Admiral Hurricane Qilangos. And inside Qilangos was the crazy adventurer, Gehrman Sherlock. And inside Gehrman Sparrow was the identity of the great detective, Sherlock Moriarty. And inside Sherlock Moriarty was the identity of Klein Moretti.\nThis wasn't the end. Deep within Klein Moretti was Mr. Fool-Zhou Mingrui.\nThere's no reason that she can directly see my true essence. Besides, how can she know of a trivial character like Klein Moretti... Even Vice Admiral Hurricane Qilangos wouldn't have left the Vice Admiral Ailment Tracy's helper surprised! To be specially invited by a Sequence 5 pirate admiral to protect herself and deal with her enemy, the person must be at least a Sequence 4 demigod...\nTherefore, that sentence was directed at Mr. Azik? That high-ranking Demoness recognizes Mr. Azik, who had destroyed their cooperation with the royal family and Ince Zangwill in Backlund, or does she recognizes him from one of his former lives?Klein quickly cleared his train of thoughts and remained guarded against Tracy and her helper's sudden attacks. He also looked through the corner of his eye to observe Mr. Azik's reaction.\nHe wasn't too surprised that a mysterious powerhouse would appear. Firstly, this was because Mr. Azik had already given a warning, and secondly, it was because he believed that Vice Admiral Ailment Tracy wasn't a self-conceited person. To almost be assassinated without knowing the assassin's backing faction and motive, there was a high probability that she would leave the sea around the Rorsted Archipelago to seek help from the upper echelons of the Demoness Sect.\nThe only thing hadn't expected was that her helper would arrive so quickly. It was as though she was nearby or had a mystical item like that of a Traveler.\nCombining the female characteristics of the voice and the gentleness within it, Klein suspected that it was a Demoness at the demigod level.\nAzik stood on the thick carpet and said after two seconds of hesitation, \"You know me?\"\nThis tone sounds uncertain... Could it be that my big shot had once spent a period of time with a Demoness? No, I can't think of it that way...Klein began to imagine things before he seriously felt penitent for having those thoughts.\nHe noticed that Vice Admiral Ailment Tracy wore an aghast look. Her certainty and calm had turned into puzzlement.\nThe gentle female voice sounded out from an unknown location again.\n\"I obviously know you. You should also know me.\"\nAzik turned his ears to the side to listen before he shook his head and gave a rueful smile.\n\"I'm sorry. I've repeatedly lost my memories and am in the midst of recovering them.\n\"If you can remind me and invoke more of my memories, I'll be very grateful to you.\"\nUpon hearing their conversation, Tracy's puzzled and confused look settled.\nShe cautiously swept her gaze at Klein but frowned when she saw Vice Admiral Hurricane Qilangos's face.\nThe gentle female voice sighed.\n\"The last time we met was 1,300 years ago. Back then, Primordial and Death were working together, instigating the Pale Disaster in the Northern Continent. You might've already forgotten that we once fought the Saints and Angels of the Church of the Evernight Goddess.\nI know this piece of history. It was recorded in Emperor Roselle's diary... Mr. Door said that it resulted in the Primordial Demoness being heavily injured, and she had only managed to descend only in recent times. As for Death, \"He\" directly perished and created the Berserk Sea that separated the Northern and Southern Continents... The Demoness Sect and the forces of Death had previously cooperated, so it's no wonder that a demigod-ranked Demoness knows Mr. Azik. Man, she's also a monster that has lived for at least fourteen hundred years!Klein thought with a creative mind.\nFollowing that, he felt puzzled again. He originally imagined that Mr. Azik had suffered heavy injuries from being glanced at Blood Emperor Alista Tudor during the War of the Four Emperors, which resulted in him constantly losing his memory and forgetting his past. However, what the demigod-ranked Demoness indicated was that not only did Azik survive the War of the Four Emperors, but he had even participated in the Pale Disaster many years later. He didn't seem to have any problems in between.\nAzik closed his eyes as though he was trying to squeeze out his memories.\nAfter a few seconds, he asked hesitantly, \"Katarina Pell\u00e8?\n\"You... are already a Demoness of Unaging?\"\n\"I'm very happy that you can still remember me. I could only be considered a weakling compared to you back then.\" A figure outlined itself beside Vice Admiral Ailment Tracy. She wore a simple and pure white gown which had high slits that revealed her flawless legs. Her skin was as white as snow and as tender as a young maiden's.\nThe woman had black hair and blue eyes, and she looked elegant and pretty. She had an indescribable charm.\nShe looked towards Azik Eggers as a faint smile curled at the corner of her lips.\n\"More than a thousand years have passed. It's a cause for celebration for us to meet, alive.\n\"Balam Empire's Mr. Death Consul.\"\nMr. Azik was Balam Empire's Death Consul... This is the name of a later potion in the Death pathway? This Demoness of Unaging Katarina Pell\u00e8 looks like she's in her thirties. She's elegant and pure, yet she exudes a mature charm... Wait, why am I thinking of this? Her Pleasure charms are already that potent?Katarina hurriedly moved his gaze away and nearly had to use Cogitation to calm his emotions.\nWithout waiting for Azik to say a word, Katarina Pell\u00e8 said with a melodic voice, \"I'm curious over why you would still be constantly losing your memories.\n\"I remember that it only happens for your pathway during the Undying stage. Dying once every sixty years to revive again and forget the past. However, you have long advanced past that and escaped from that curse.\n\"What happened to you at the end of the Pale Disaster?\n\"Heh heh, the seven gods had fractured back then and treated each other as enemies. We both believed that Primordial and Death would succeed, but who knew that the proudest Sun and the most arrogant Tyrant would bow \u2018Their' heads. They quickly joined forces again. If I hadn't managed to advance by chance, then I might've already perished at the end of that divine battle. I believe you should've suffered some damage which resulted in your present state. Death's perishing is itself the greatest injury for you.\"\nAzik fell silent as he wore an indistinct painful expression.\n\"I-I can't remember...\"\nAt this moment, Klein realized that Katarina Pell\u00e8 looked somewhat familiar, and he suspected her of being the white-robed lady who had led Madam Sharon onto the path of a Demoness.\nSuddenly, Katarina's eyes turned to sweep a glance at Klein. She chuckled at Azik and said, \"I believe you haven't forgotten the reason for visiting today?\n\"I'm very curious why he would assassinate Tracy. Could it be for justice?\"\nThe glance the Demoness of Unaging swept over was filled with hidden amorousness and sweet playfulness. She resembled an underage young maiden, and her facial features and bearing had magically accentuated that feeling. She didn't have the jarring feeling of a mature lady acting young at all. At that moment, Klein viewed her as a maiden who was sixteen or seventeen.\n... She can already perfectly present every charm a woman can bring. She has the skin, facial features, and bearing to match it... As expected of a Demoness of Unaging...Klein had already attempted to use Cogitation to resist this indescribable charm.\nHe took the initiative to look at Ailment Maiden Tracy.\n\"Do you know the tycoon named Jimmy Necker?\"\nTracy gaped her mouth before closing it again. She replied blankly and aggrieved, \"Who is he?\"\n\"You might not know him. He once collected a batch of ancient chronicles related to Death. He died at the hands of Vice Admiral Hurricane Qilangos,\" Klein said while bearing the appearance of Vice Admiral Hurricane Qilangos.\nTracy narrowed her eyes. She wore a dazed look before turning angry.\n\"You came for those documents?\"\nIt really is in your hands...Klein determined based on her tone.\nHe answered indifferently.\n\"That's right.\"\nTracy inhaled slightly and said, \"Where's Helene? Did you do anything to her? I know she's still alive. If something happens to her, my spiritual intuition will tell me.\"\nKlein didn't attempt to speak ambiguously as he directly answered her, \"She has already returned to Intis to lead a brand new life.\"\nTracy's expression sank. A storm raged in her eyes as the aura of a pirate admiral fully revealed itself. However, Azik casually swept his gaze over and instantly made her calm down.\nThe corners of her lips curled up.\n\"That batch of documents from the mausoleum of the Balam Empire's royalty is indeed in my hands.\n\"But I wasn't interested in it. I flipped through it casually before handing it to the sect.\n\"Hehe, even if you had succeeded in assassinating me, you wouldn't have received it. I didn't read it much, so even if you channeled my spirit, I wouldn't be able to reproduce it. Unfortunately, I can't bear to part with my life; otherwise, it definitely would've been interesting to see your disappointment.\"\nKlein calmly said, \"No, I won't be disappointed. I can obtain the soul and characteristic of a Demoness of Affliction. I can Graze you and subdue you.\"\nAs he spoke, he raised his left palm which had Creeping Hunger on it. It was in the shape of a black glove.\nTracy narrowed her eyes. The look in her eyes became extremely dangerous, like a provoked tiger. If not for the two High-Sequence Beyonders beside her, she might've already attacked.\nAnd the moment Klein finished his sentence, he noticed something amiss.\nI'm not acting as Gehrman Sparrow at the moment, so why am I speaking in accordance with his persona...Klein was alarmed as he suspected whether he had been too into character recently.\nRemember, you can only be yourself.\nI cannot be influenced by the character I act as, because of prolonged acting... This will cause me to become lost and result in losing control!\nHe quickly reflected on himself and added his conclusions into the acting principles of a Faceless.\nNoticing his brief silence, Azik looked at Katarina Pell\u00e8 and said in his usual tone, \"Can you copy a set of those documents for me?\"\n\"That's not a big problem.\" Katarina gave Tracy a glance. \"Any requests?\"\nTracy stared at Klein and said with a clearly hoarse voice, \"Tell me where Helene is.\"\nKlein withdrew his thoughts and looked at her before looking at the pure Demoness of Unaging, Katarina.\nHe had already made his decision, but he couldn't help but feel hesitant.\nHe turned to look at Mr. Azik and discovered his warm smile. He wasn't urging him or forcing him.\nKlein retracted his gaze and simply said, \"I refuse.\""}
{"num_chp":6,"summary":"Not only did they speak the same Loen language, they also shared the same grim and tense vibes.\nWhere am I? What do I plan to do here? I would like to know too...Calming himself down, Zhou Mingrui silently repeated the questions posed by the two.\nWhat left the deepest impression on him were neither the sentences formed by words nor the meanings behind them, but the display of bewilderment, vigilance, panic, and reverence by the couple!\nFor some baffling reason, two people had been mysteriously dragged into this world surrounded by gray fog. As the perpetrator, Zhou Mingrui was already feeling abnormally dumbfounded and startled, let alone the couple who was pulled into this mess completely passively!\nFor them, such events and encounters might already be beyond their imaginations, right?\nMomentarily, Zhou Mingrui thought of two options: The first option was feigning victimhood to hide his true identity, and in turn gain a considerable amount of trust. He could then take a wait-and-see approach and take advantage of his circumstances where necessary. The other option was to maintain his mysterious identity in the eyes of the couple. He could then affect the subsequent development while gleaning valuable information from them.\nWithout the luxury of time to deliberate over the situation, he grasped hold of the thought that flashed across his mind. He made an immediate decision to try out the second idea.\nExploit the psychological state of the others to gain the greatest advantage for himself!\nAfter a few seconds of silence in the fog, Zhou Mingrui chuckled. With a low but not heavy tone, he calmly spoke as though he was replying to the polite greetings from the visitors, \"An attempt.\"\nAn attempt... an attempt?Audrey Hall looked at the mysterious guy veiled in the grayish-white fog, and the only thought was that whatever was happening was absurd, funny, horrifying, and weird.\nShe was at the dressing table inside her bedroom only moments ago. But just by turning around, she had \"come\" into this place that was filled with gray fog!\nHow inconceivable!\nAudrey took a breath, revealing an impeccable, courteous smile. She asked in a somewhat perturbed way, \"Sir, is the attempt over? Might you permit our return?\"\nAlger Wilson also had the intentions to probe Zhou Mingrui in a similar fashion, but his rich experience made him statelier. He held back his impulse and only took on the role of a silent onlooker.\nZhou Mingrui looked at the questioner. Looking through the hazy mist, he could roughly see the silhouette of the person in question. It was a tall girl with smooth blond hair, but her exact countenance could not be seen clearly.\nHe did not rush to reply the girl's question but turned around to look at the man. He had messy dark-blue hair, as well as a medium stature that was not considered stout.\nZhou Mingrui suddenly realized something. Once he became stronger or had a deeper understanding of the foggy world, perhaps it was possible for him to see through the fog and discern the girl and the man.\nIn this situation, they are the visitors, and I'm the master!\nAfter changing his mindset, Zhou Mingrui instantly noticed details that he had neglected earlier on.\nThe girl with a melodious voice and the mature, withdrawn man both looked considerably incorporeal. Tainted by a faint crimson red, they resembled a projected image of the two crimson red \"stars\" beyond the gray fog.\nThis projection was based on the connection between the crimson red and himself, an intangible connection that only he himself could realistically grasp hold of.\nThe projection would disappear once the connection was cut, and the couple would then return... Zhou Mingrui nodded mildly and looked at the blond, chuckling. \"Of course, if you make a formal request, you can return this very moment.\"\nWhen she did not identify any ill intention from his tone, Audrey heaved a sigh of relief. She believed that since a gentleman who was capable of such miraculous things had given his word, he would definitely abide by it stringently.\nWith her mind somewhat mollified, she surprisingly was in no hurry to request her leave. She rolled her virid eyes left and right, which sparkled with an abnormal radiance.\nShe said in an anxious, anticipative and tempted manner, \"This is such a wonderful experience... Yes, I have always been hoping that something like this would happen. I mean-I like mysteries and supernatural miracles. No, my point is-what I mean is that, Sir, what can I do to become a Beyonder?\"\nShe got more excited as she spoke, so much so she was fumbling over her words. The dream that sprouted in her as a result of listening to thrilling fantasies as told by her elders finally saw the possibility of being materialized.\nHowever, with just a few words, she had already forgotten all her previous fears and horrors.\nGood question! I would also like to know the answer...Zhou Mingrui complained inwardly.\nHe started to ponder on an answer to the question to maintain his unfathomable image.\nAt the same time, he felt that it was quite unbecoming of him to talk while standing. Shouldn't he be in a palace, sitting at the head of a long table, and on a mysterious high-back chair engraved with ancient patterns, while silently observing his visitors?\nAs soon as this thought surfaced, the gray fog started to churn, giving both Audrey and Alger a shock.\nIn an instant, they saw a number of towering stone pillars around them. Above them was a vast dome that encapsulated them.\nThis entire edifice looked magnificent, grand and lofty, just like a legendary palace for giants.\nDirectly under the dome where the gray fog gathered, a long, bronze table appeared with ten high-back chairs on either side in a symmetrical arrangement. The back of each chair dazzled and shone faintly with crimson red, drawing the outlines of weird constellations that differed from reality.\nAudrey and Alger sat face-to-face, sitting next to the Seat of Honor.\nThe girl looked to her sides, and could not help but mumble, \"How fascinating...\"\nIt is certainly fascinating...Zhou Mingrui extended his right hand and caressed the edge of the bronze table a little while maintaining an unperturbed expression.\nAlger inspected the surroundings, and after a few seconds of silence, he suddenly opened his mouth, and answered Audrey's question in place of Zhou Mingrui.\n\"Are you a Loen?\n\"If you want to become a Beyonder, join the Churches of either the Evernight Goddess, the Lord of Storms, or the God of Steam and Machinery.\n\"The majority of us will not meet a Beyonder our entire lives. This has caused churches, and even some clergies within some of the biggest churches, to suspect the same. While this is the case, I am certain to tell you that Beyonders still exist in courts, tribunals, and execution agencies. They are still fighting against the dangers that grow in the dark, only that their numbers are much fewer as compared to before and during the early days of the Iron Age.\"\nZhou Mingrui listened attentively, but he tried his best to present himself as paying little attention to Alger's words, much like how young kids listened to stories.\nRelying on Klein's fragmented general knowledge of history, Zhou Mingrui knew clearly that the \"Iron Age\" referred to the current epoch, which was the Fifth Epoch that began 1349 years ago.\nAudrey silently listened to Alger finish his sentence before sighing.\n\"Mister, I know all about what you just said; I even know more than that, including the Nighthawks, the Mandated Punisher, and the Machinery Hivemind, but I don't want to lose my freedom.\"\nAlger gave a low-sounding laugh, and said vaguely, \"You can't become a Beyonder without sacrifices. If you don't consider joining churches and accepting their given challenges, you can only seek the royal families and the few nobles with family histories of more than a thousand years. If not, you can rely on your luck to search for clandestine evil organizations.\"\nAudrey puffed her cheeks subconsciously and looked around in a fluster. After confirming that both the \"mysterious man\" and Audrey did not notice her tic, she pressed, \"Are there no other solutions?\"\nAlger sank into silence. About half a minute later, he turned around to look at the \"mysterious man\" who was watching the two of them in silence.\nRealizing that Zhou Mingrui had no plans to make any comment, he looked back at Audrey and said with deliberation, \"I have two sets of Sequence 9 Potion formulas.\"\nSequence 9?Zhou Mingrui muttered to himself.\n\"Really? Which two sets?\" Audrey clearly knew what the Sequence 9 Potion formulas meant.\nAlger leaned back slightly, and replied unhurriedly, \"As you know, humanity can only depend on potions to become real Beyonders, while the names of potions come from the \u2018Blasphemy Slate.' After constant translations intoJotun1, Elvish, ancient and modern Hermes, and ancient Feysac, they have undergone changes to match the day and age of that era. The essence is not in their names, but whether they portray the \u2018core characteristics' of the potions.\n\"I have a Sequence 9 Potion named \u2018Sailor.' It enables you to have excellent balancing capabilities. Even if you were on a boat in a rainstorm, you will be able to walk about freely as though you were on land. You will also gain immense strength and illusory scales under your skin. They will enable you to swim like a fish and be difficult to catch. You will move agilely underwater just like marine animals. Even without any equipment, you will be able to easily submerge underwater for at least ten minutes.\"\n\"Sounds great... the \u2018Keepers of the Seas' from the Lord of Storms?\"\n\"It was called by that name in the past.\" Alger did not pause and continued. \"The second set of Sequence 9 Potions is called \u2018Spectator,' although I am not sure what it was called in the past. This set of potions enables you to have an exceptionally sharp mind with acute observational abilities. I believe you can understand by what \u2018spectator' means from watching operas and plays. Just like an audience, spectators judge the \u2018actors' in the secular world, catching a glimpse of the real thoughts of them through their emotions, conduct, and mantras.\"\nAt this point, Alger emphasized, \"You must remember, regardless of whether you are at an extravagant banquet or a crowded street, spectators can only be spectators forever.\"\nAudrey's eyes shone as she listened, and spoke after a long while, \"Why? Alright, this is a follow-up question. I-I think I have fallen in love with this feeling-of being a \u2018spectator.' How can I get this potion's formula? What can I use to trade with you for it?\"\nAlger looked like he was already prepared as he said in a deep voice, \"The blood of Ghost Sharks, at least 100 milliliters of it.\"\nAudrey nodded her head excitedly, but subsequently asked worriedly, \"If I can get it-and I'm saying if-how do I hand it to you? How can you promise me that you can give the potion's formula to me in return for the Ghost Shark's blood, as well as the authenticity of the formula?\"\nAlger said calmly, \"I'll give you an address. I'll mail the formula to you, or tell you directly here, once I receive the blood of the Ghost Shark.\"\n\"As for promises, I think that both you and I can feel rest assured under the witness of the mysterious sir.\"\nAs he said this, he swept his eyes towards Zhou Mingrui who was sitting up straight at the Seat of Honor.\n\"Sir, the fact that you brought us here shows that you have tremendous strength unimaginable to us. Neither one of us would dare violate a promise with you as witness.\"\n\"That's right!\" Audrey's eyes sparkled and agreed with excitement.\nFrom her perspective, the mysterious gentleman who had unimaginable abilities was definitely an \"authoritative\" witness.\nHow could I or the guy opposite me dare trick him!\nAudrey half-turned her body and looked at Zhou Mingrui earnestly.\n\"Sir, please be the witness of our trade.\"\nAt that moment, she then realized that she was all too impolite, having forgotten all along to ask a particular question. She asked hurriedly, \"Sir, how should we address you?\"\nAlger nodded slightly, and echoed the same question in a serious manner, \"Sir, how should we address you?\"\nZhou Mingrui was taken aback. He gently rapped his fingers on the bronze table. The contents of the earlier divination flashed across his mind suddenly.\nHe leaned back, withdrew his right hand, and crossed his ten fingers, placing them below his chin. He gave the duo a faint smile.\n\"You can address me as...\"\nUpon saying this, he paused for a moment. He said amiably and calmly, \"The Fool.\""}
{"num_chp":220,"summary":"\"Attempt?\" Justice was instantly thrilled as she nodded her, acting reserved and elegant.\n\"I'm very willing to cooperate.\"\nAs a Spectator, she clearly remembered that Mr. Fool had only used the word \"attempt\" on two things. The first time involved bringing her and The Hanged Man into this mysterious space, and the second time was when they were given an honorary name so that they could attempt to make a prayer. And the outcome was sufficiently successful, revealing \"His\" true nature.\nWhat would it be this time? It really is something to look forward to!Audrey restrained her impatience and tried her best to behave as a qualified Spectator.\nAttempt...Alger suddenly tensed up, viewing The Fool's proposal with utmost wariness.\nWhat does \"He\" want to do? What is \"His\" true purpose? Is this good or bad for me?One by one, thoughts popped up in his mind. The rapidly rotting appearance of Rear Admiral Hurricane Qilangos surfaced in Alger's mind.\nFinally, he lowered his head and respectfully replied, \"Your wish is my wish.\"\nBeside him, Derrick looked at The Hanged Man, and then at Justice, wondering why they were so sensitive to this so-called \"attempt.\"\nKlein lightly tapped his fingers on the edge of the long bronze table and smiled.\n\"This attempt will make your transaction easier and safer, and it will definitely be sufficiently confidential.\"\nHe turned his head to the side and looked at The Hanged Man. He said with a moderate pace, \"Do you remember the sacrificial ritual described by The Sun?\"\nKlein had deliberately mentioned it to show how open he was. It made it difficult for the members of the Tarot Club to imagine that the sacrificial ceremony he was about to provide had actually first been obtained from The Sun and that he had gone through all that time and effort back then to trick The Sun out of a template sacrificial ritual.\n\"I remember. I do come into contact with such things usually,\" Alger answered truthfully, but his heart was throbbing.\nSince the orthodox gods rarely responded to similar rituals, the word \"sacrifice\" had often been equated to evil gods and devils in the Fifth Epoch!\nThinking about how this could lead to a terrifying outcome, The Hanged Man felt as if he was walking at the edge of the abyss. If he wasn't careful, he would fall in, only to be eroded and devoured.\nKlein followed his plans and didn't provide further explanations. He nodded slightly and said, \"My idea is for you to sacrifice the Beyonder material to me through the ritual and I'll bestow them to Miss Justice. A transaction like this will be beneficial for both of you.\"\nThat can be done?Audrey was instantly dumbfounded. She felt that this exceeded the limits of her imagination.\nBut she very quickly came to her senses and understood the advantages of this method and the true nature of a deity hidden behind this simple act!\nMr. Fool is great! As expected, our Tarot Club will be different from the other secret organizations! We'll use the method of deities to exchange for material goods and ingredients!Audrey almost said \"Praise the Lady\" in her mind out of habit, but in the end, she said, \"Praise Mr. Fool\" instead.\nAlger turned even warier as he entered a state of calm thoughts.\n\"Honorable Mr. Fool, what do I need to do?\"\nHe tried to figure out the true purpose of The Fool from the process of the sacrificial ritual.\nKlein lightly pressed his right hand and said, \"Like I said, this is only an attempt. It might not succeed, so it will need your cooperation.\n\"First of all, prepare an altar. There's no need to make it too complicated; it can be very simple and crude. The only requirement is to engrave or draw this symbol.\"\nAs he spoke, a screen of light appeared in front of him. On it was the symbol of the hidden \"Pupil-less Eye\" and the mysterious symbol of the partial contorted lines; the same symbol on the back of The Fool's chair.\nAfter previous experiments without using materials with spirituality, Klein was certain that the sacrificial ceremony he designed could create an illusory gate above the gray fog, similar to the Door of Summoning. However, his strength alone couldn't construct a stable channel, and he could only use the uniqueness of the mysterious space above the gray fog to complete the sacrifice.\nTherefore, he was 90% confident that the ceremony would be successful. The only problem was if an ordinary passageway could be constructed using ordinary materials that contained spirituality or did it need to be Beyonder materials as well as a sufficient number of them.\nI'll let Miss Justice and Mr. Hanged Man bear the cost of this experiment... In any case, they knew from the very beginning that the Tarot Club was a product of an attempt. It can be foreseen that there would be other attempts subsequently and failure is inevitable. Even deities are no exception...Klein decided to transfer the costs.\nAs The Hanged Man, Justice, and the Sun were attempting to memorize the symbol, Klein chuckled.\n\"If you forget, you can pray to me, and then you can \u2018remember.'\"\n\"Alright,\" Audrey answered happily.\nWith Mr. Fool, rituals aren't tedious and troublesome!she thought happily.\nThe Hanged Man nodded in response as Klein continued the description.\n\"Secondly, follow the normal procedure, but there's no need to burn any more additional herbs or apply the holy oil. There's no restriction on time, just chanting my name is enough.\n\"Remember, use ancient Hermes or Jotun to recite this piece of prayer.\n\"Your devoted servant prays for your attention,\n\"I pray for you to take his offerings.\n\"I pray for you to open the gates to your Kingdom.\n\"After you finish chanting, combine the materials that contain spirituality with the natural power created by the incantation, and await my response.\n\"If you don't succeed in this step, change from materials containing spirituality to Beyonder materials, and try again from the beginning.\"\nAfter listening quietly to the procedure, Alger felt that his previous guess was very likely to be the truth.\nThe Fool was in a predicament!\nHe offered alluring attempts, making attempts one step at a time and planned to use himself, Justice, and The Sun to slowly break free of the restrictions. In the end, he might even descend into the real world!\nThis was also the true reason why \"He\" had initially pulled people into this mysterious space, agreeing to the establishment of the Tarot Club!\nEven without this previous speculation, Alger believed that he would've come to the same conclusion after hearing of the experimental procedures required after the sacrificial ritual and comparing it with The Fool's previous attempts.\nThe only thing that stumped him was the possession of a powerful adorer; therefore, there was no need for him to use himself, Justice, and The Sun. His adorer could make similar attempts.\nThere must be secrets I don't know about yet...The attempts need to be sufficiently secretive. And perhaps \"His\" adorer is being watched by certain existences?Alger began connecting the dots.\nAfter Klein finished describing the ritual, he asked in a low but gentle voice, \"The sacrificial ritual needs a specific time. Mr. Hanged Man, when do you plan on making the attempt?\"\nThis was different from responding to a request which could have a delayed response. The stable passage created by the sacrificial ritual could only exist for a very short period of time, so Klein had to wait above the gray fog ahead of time.\n\"The Rainbow Salamander's pituitary gland is the only Beyonder material I have with me for the time being. As for materials with spirituality, I do have quite a lot... Mr. Fool, once the gathering ends, I'll immediately attempt the first scenario. If it fails, I'll seek out other Beyonder materials. Once I obtain anything, I'll inform you by praying to confirm a time,\" Alger said as he couldn't help but turn his gaze towards Miss Justice.\nAs a Spectator, Audrey instantly understood what he meant. She answered without the slightest hesitation, \"If any additional Beyonder materials are required, I'll compensate you afterward. Well... I can't guarantee the specific type of material you would want.\"\nAs expected of the wealthy Miss Justice... The Fool-Klein-couldn't help but sigh before chuckling.\n\"We have come to an agreement.\"\nHe looked at Justice and said after some thought, \"Once Mr. Hanged Man's attempt succeeds, I'll inform you of the bestowment ceremony.\"\n\"Alright!\" Audrey was entirely confident with Mr. Fool's abilities.\nAfter answering the question, a sudden thought struck her as she realized that the exchange of money could also be done through this method. Of course, this was only if the attempt was a success.\nI wonder if items without any spirituality would work or not... I'll ask Mr. Fool again after the attempt is successful...Audrey's lips curled as she thought of the beautiful future.\nWith the sacrifice and bestowment topic coming to an end, she deliberated for a few seconds before saying, \"Mr. Fool, I've found two ladies suitable for our Tarot Club. They're both Beyonders and have their own circle and resources in Backlund. They're also able to keep a secret and have decent personalities. Are you willing to let them join the gathering?\"\nDoes Justice want to strengthen her faction within the Tarot Club?This was the most instinctual thought that Alger had.\nDerrick was very interested in this matter as he looked sideways at Mr. Fool, waiting for his answer in anticipation.\nKlein appeared to be in a bit of a dilemma. Previously, he had imagined that the members of the Tarot Club wouldn't know each other, and they would then develop their own subordinates, forming a relatively tight and secretive organization.\nThis way, even if a certain member was exposed, captured, or had their spirit channeled, it wouldn't have much of an impact on the Tarot Club.\nBut Miss Justice's description just happened to hit his weak spot. He was hoping to find clues regarding the Secret Order and Lanevus by acquainting himself with Beyonders with different circles and resources in Backlund.\nIf it's done through Justice, the person involved would eventually hold back... However, I'm not sure if it's possible to pull them up above the gray fog simply by reciting my name...In order to maintain his image, Klein didn't think too much and instead procrastinated on it.\nHe said calmly, \"It will require a certain amount of examination.\n\"Miss Justice, use a clandestine method that wouldn't expose yourself to let them know of my name to garner interest in them.\"\nWhen Audrey saw that her proposal was about to be accepted, she immediately responded in excitement, \"Yes, Mr. Fool!\"\nAfter a few more exchanges, the gathering came to an end. The Sun, The Hanged Man, and Justice returned, while Klein remained in the gray fog, waiting for the sacrifice."}
{"num_chp":586,"summary":"\"What? He knows me?\" the chubby Apothecary, Darkwill, was alarmed as he whispered back.\nThe owl's round eyes looked ahead and said, \"I noticed that he clearly paused for two seconds the moment he saw you when he came in.\"\n\"Perhaps he thinks someone like me doesn't match his image of an Apothecary?\" the chubby Apothecary retorted.\nThe owl spread its wings and landed.\n\"Suit yourself if you wish to think so.\"\n\"... What books have you been reading recently?\" The fat on the chubby Apothecary's face trembled.\nThe owl replied sternly and seriously, \"My reading is based on your knowledge standards such as those involving soccer.\n\"Unfortunately, the words you grasp and can teach me are limited. I have no choice but to read popular novels that have a lower requirement on one's vocabulary.\n\"Besides, they're all serialized on the newspaper.\"\nDarkwill chuckled.\n\"I'll buy a recipe cookbook later. It's called Guide to East Balam Bird Culinary Methods.\"\nWithout waiting for the owl to answer, his expression sank and he muttered to himself, \"He knows me? He looks like the standard Loenese man. More than half his blood is at least Loen.\n\"I used a fake name to stay in a few cities in Loen. It's not odd to be recognized by him. But I still need to be on guard. If I don't receive any news about Old Man before March, then I have to leave this place...\"\nHaving said that, he turned his head to look at the owl who was perched on his shoulder.\n\"At times, you're still rather useful.\"\n\"No, your eyes and your body language tells me that your real thoughts are \u2018darn it. I wanted to buy a pet that can help me beat monsters and gangsters. I sought out Beyonder ingredients of a potion recipe according to the standards of a dragon, but I ended up getting a silly bird who only knows how to read newspapers and plays. Darn it. I want to stuff another potion down its throat!'\" the owl repeated like a parrot by mimicking the chubby Apothecary's tone.\nDarkwill's expression stiffened for a few seconds before he chuckled.\n\"It's good that you know this, silly bird!\n\"If I didn't have the powers of a Beast Tamer, you wouldn't have even managed a single potion!\"\nInside the herb store, the man and bird fell into silence.\nAfter a while, the owl pretended as though nothing had happened as it asked, \"Darkwill, is it really going to work? You've already entrusted this to dozens of adventurers.\"\n\"I'm not good at finding people, so I can only entrust it to someone else. Besides, they have to find and confirm Old Man's location before I make a payment. I don't even need to spend a single penny!\" the chubby Apothecary tsked as he said before he sighed. \"Old Man always calls himself a lucky person and a winner of fate. He should be fine...\"\n...\n\"Will the medicine brewed from this really be effective?\" While returning to the Wind of Azure Inn via carriage, Danitz looked at the paper bag beside Klein.\nThe things inside were black herbs, strangely-shaped insect carapaces, and weirdly-colored flowers. It didn't seem like anything reliable.\nKlein nodded.\n\"Yes.\"\n\"You haven't drunk it...\" Danitz subconsciously retorted.\nI trust him. Although his mouth stinks and is rather vile, he has a rather kind heart... Besides, Captain Elland believes that his medicine is sufficiently effective...As Gehrman Sparrow, Klein didn't respond to Danitz's doubts. He directly picked up the paper bag and threw it over.\nWithout needing any spoken words, Danitz knew what he meant. He was in charge of brewing the medicine.\nFurthermore, he was accustomed to doing similar matters recently, so he didn't have any urges to resist.\nAfter returning to the Wind of Azure Inn, Klein got a chair to sit in while he watched Danitz light up the fireplace and prop up a pot. He then added water and the herbs into it.\nLeaning back, Klein felt his head feel groggy. He was very exhausted and felt like he could fall asleep at any moment.\nIn order to wait for the medicine to finish brewing and for him to quickly resolve his illness, he forced himself to consider various problems to combat the fatigue.\nOn careful consideration, during the battle with Vice Admiral Ailment, if I hadn't succeeded in sneaking in an attack on her and suppressing her from the very beginning, preventing her from getting into her rhythm until she eventually found a chance to force open a gap between us by turning invisible, then I might've not been her match.\nThe two powers of invisibility and ailments are really like a bug in a game. Matched with an Assassin's lethal strike, and the interference of pleasure, it really makes one unable to find and hit her or escape. One can only watch their body gradually weaken and become inflicted with all sorts of ailments. One can even get mesmerized and give up resisting...\nOn the one hand, it's because every Sequence 5 is very powerful. As expected of the Sequence just before a demigod. On the other hand, it's because Creeping Hunger's various powers aren't a good match. It cannot be considered to be multifaceted without any weaknesses.\nYes. The powers of a Sequence 5 Nimblewright Master of the Seer pathway is highly effective against invisibility...\nI can try to help the chubby Apothecary find his teacher in the meantime, but without any information, with just a picture, I can only try my luck. I'll have to see when I can directly find a clue. After all, I'm not a god, and I can't find people remotely...\nWait, in a certain way, I am a god!\nI can get Sea God believers to help find him. As long as that old gentleman named Roy King once visited Bayam, he would've definitely encountered others and be seen by them. Most native residents secretly believe in Sea God... This is what it means by a sea of people...\nAlso, before Captain Elland leaves Bayam, I should get him to introduce me to a point of contact for the military. In the future, I can get him to reimburse me for any intel. They can also check if there were any travelers named Roy King, who registered on any liners in recent months.\nThere's another method. I've placed the radio transceiver above the gray fog for some time. I should be able to contact the magic mirror, Arrodes, if I take it down. I was originally planning on asking for Helene's location, but I no longer need to find the red-haired lady anymore. I can switch to Roy King.\nHehe, for a matter which many adventurers have no clue on how to begin, I have three solutions!\n...\nAmidst his thoughts, Klein finally held on until the medicine was successfully brewed.\nLooking at the bottle of blackish-green liquid that Danitz brought over, he hesitated for two seconds before extending his hand to receive it and placed it to his mouth.\nGulp!\nKlein immediately felt his throat burn as his face flushed red.\nThis made him recall his attempt at eating crazy spicy food in his previous life.\nSuddenly, his entire person awakened as his stuffy nose quickly cleared.\nGulp! Gulp...He barely finished drinking it and felt as though he had nearly recovered from his sickness.\nBy night time, he had fully recovered. He no longer showed any doubt towards an Apothecary's abilities.\nNo wonder the potion's name is ApothecaryKlein wore his hat and left the inn with Danitz. Under the cloak of night, they left Bayam and came to a secret harbor hidden on the other end of the jungle.\nTonight, the Golden Dream was providing aid to the Resistance.\nAfter some coordination and hassle, Danitz used the Soulfall Ritual to contact Vice Admiral Iceberg Edwina.\nAfter some time, the ship, that was often scrubbed clean and had a strange main cannon, docked by the private harbor. Its gigantic sails drew five types of gold coins. They were the gold pound of Loen, the gold hoorn of Feysac, the verl gold of Intis, the gold risot of Feynapotter, and the sassen gold of Lenburg.\nThis was the flag of the Golden Dream, it was also the symbol of this pirate crew.\nIt's still not professional enough. If it were me, I would add porter gold from Masin, z\u0142oty from Segar, motif gold coins from Balam Empire, etc...Klein stood by the side with his hands in his pocket as he watched Edwina Edwards appear at the bow.\nAt that moment, she was wearing a hunter's hat, a rider's shirt, and a black coat. She matched the image of a female pirate admiral in the minds of the Resistance.\nShe often dresses like she's a private tutor...Klein mumbled and took a few steps back, allowing Danitz to run around and busy himself.\nThis pirate worth 5,500 pounds did the liaison, sending a batch of food and fabric to Kalat and the Resistance before the transaction came to a close.\nDanitz secretly inhaled and came to Klein's side and forced a smile.\n\"There's nothing else, right?\n\"I can now return to the Golden Dream, right?\n\"Also, how do you plan on settling the hiring fee?\"\nThat's only an excuse your captain and I used. In a particular sense, this batch of food and fabric is my payment...Klein nodded.\n\"Your Captain has already paid.\n\"You can return.\"\n\"For real?\" Danitz found it unbelievable.\nAlthough Vice Admiral Iceberg Edwina wasn't far behind him, he was still afraid that Gehrman Sparrow would suddenly have a crazy fit.\nKlein didn't reply and turned around, walking straight towards the path that led out of the private harbor.\nDanitz exhaled silently and held back his excited feelings before briskly running back to the Golden Dream.\nOnly when the Golden Dream steered far away into the night, with the private harbor that belonged to the Resistance slowly shrinking in size, did he really believe that he was back on the Golden Dream.\nAt that instant, he felt that he had experienced just too many things over the past half a month or so. It was an unprecedented level of exhilaration, as though it was an interesting dream.\nAt this moment, a sailor came close and asked out of curiosity, \"Boss, was Steel Maveti really killed by you?\"\nDanitz immediately laughed out loud and secretly stole a glance at Captain Edwina before saying to his subordinate, \"I contributed greatly to this deed. Let's talk over drinks!\"\nAbove the dark sea, the Golden Dream drifted off into the distance.\n...\nAfter returning to the Wind of Azure Inn, Klein was just about to sleep when he saw the surrounding colors turn abnormally bright.\nThe white bedsheets turned whiter, and the brown floorboards turned more brownish-yellow. The dark red curtains appeared like fresh blood...\nIn the scene with all sorts of colors stacked upon each other, Azik Eggers suddenly walked out from a rippling aqueous void.\nHe was dressed in his usual shirt, bow tie, tailcoat, and a top hat. His skin was bronze in color, and he had soft facial features.\nHow enviable... I also wish to have such powers of traveling through the spirit world...Klein silently sighed as he smiled in greeting while maintaining his appearance.\n\"Good evening, Mr. Azik.\"\nAzik took off his top hat and looked at the rather unfamiliar face. Without finding it strange, he chuckled.\n\"Apologies. I came in a hurry. I should've knocked on the door.\n\"What's the exact situation with those Death chronicles?\"\nKlein invited him to have a seat. He then described in detail things he couldn't explain in the letter. Towards the end, he mentioned in passing about the matter regarding Bansy Harbor, saying how it involved King of Angels Medici and \"His\" descendants.\nAzik leaned back into the chair and said with a frown, \"There's such a name in my memories. \u2018He' should have the two titles of Red Angel and War Angel...\n\"However, \u2018He' had perished long ago.\"\n\"Perished long ago?\" Klein asked in surprise.\nAzik nodded and thought over it.\n\"I remember that \u2018He' was killed by Blood Emperor Alista Tudor.\"\nKilled by Blood Emperor Alista Tudor?Klein's pupils shrank as he recalled the evil spirit that loitered in the underground ruins beneath Backlund.\nIt had claimed to be an innocent killed by the Blood Emperor!"}
{"num_chp":1034,"summary":"The boundless gray fog boiled as the ancient and majestic palace burned.\nThe blazing flames condensed into a fiery blob, as though a blinding sun had risen out from this mysterious space.\nA howling hurricane flipped the long mottled table, snapping the thick stone columns and causing half the palace to collapse.\nSitting at The Fool's seat, Klein's brain was boiling before holes exploded out of it. Charred maggots then began crawling out of the cracks.\nHe didn't die, and he had even very calmly reached out his right palm and tapped the armrest of the chair.\nAbove the gray fog, this mysterious space quaked in an obvious manner. Waves of power surged out one after another, calming the hurricane and extinguishing the flames. The blazing sun evaporated, inch by inch.\nThe thick stone pillars stood once more as the long mottled table returned to its original state. The magnificent and holy palace appeared as though it had never collapsed or suffered any damage.\nKlein's head recovered instantly, and the charred maggots that had drilled out had turned transparent again before crawling back inside.\nAs expected, stronger than Dragon of Imagination Ankewelt... Klein muttered to himself as his expression couldn't help but warp. He couldn't help but massage his forehead. It's painful... This pain is also clearly stronger...\nWhile muttering, he rapped the edge of the long mottled table and made the mysterious space above the gray fog quake once more.\nAmidst the quakes, a pitch-black shadow abruptly emerged out of the palace's floor.\nThis shadow twisted and struggled before being wiped clean by the gray fog's powers, leaving nothing behind.\nAfter nearly a minute, Klein calmed down completely and recalled the scene he had seen.\nThat should be the ancient sun god, the City of Silver Creator, Adam's and Amon's dad...\nFrom the crucifix \"He\" wore, and that line, \"Let there be light,\" there's a high chance that \"He\" is the first transmigrator. Perhaps he's Caucasian with a religious background...\n\"He\" used a language that can stir the powers of nature. It's similar to Jotun, but it's also different. It doesn't belong to Elvish, Dragonese, and ancient Hermes... Yes, it has similarities with the ancient Feysac of the Northern Continent and the Dutanese of the Southern Continent. This allowed me to barely understand what \"He\" was saying despite me not knowing this language... This is the language \"He\" learned from that strange giant building?\n\"He\" transmigrated there and inherited a rich inheritance?\nThe second scene was of \"Him\" suffering a betrayal, the scene of him being eaten by the Kings of Angels, White, Wisdom, and Wind?\nTo a deity who claims to be a Creator, that kind of corporeal pain and that distortion can only appear in such a situation...\nYes, the divine blood \"He\" dripped before \"His\" death fused with the silver crucifix, and it later turned into the latter's form, becoming a rather powerful Sealed Artifact.\nFrom the looks of it, the Unshadowed Crucifix was obtained by one of the three Kings of Angels, or it landed in Amon's or Adam's hands. To \"Them,\" this is an important item \"Their\" father left behind.\nThe previous possibility isn't too high. The cross's effects are extremely useful. Furthermore, its origins are a secret that needs to be kept. No one would give it to the Augustus family... From the looks of it, was it really arranged by Adam?\nWhy did \"He\" give the Unshadowed Crucifix to Miss Magician and Miss Judgment in a very reasonable manner?\n\"He\" had discovered that the two ladies believe in The Fool after observing them for some time?\nThis cross was meant for The Fool that doesn't belong to this era?\n\"He\" wishes to know where \"His\" father, who also doesn't belong to that era, came from? But the problem is how does \"He\" plan on raising that question and obtaining an answer?\nThat City of Silver's Creator's level is extremely high. \"He\" was able to sense my prying despite the long stretch of history between us. He cast his gaze above the gray fog and cast it on this mysterious space. Furthermore, the influence \"He\" created not only openly caused destruction but also secretly invaded this place, creating a special shadow. It nearly lurked here, hidden...\nDoesn't this mean that, once one obtains the authorities of several domains, a deity's level will also undergo a qualitative change?\nWhat does the uttering of \"Mysteries\" mean? Is it pointing to me, or the original owner of this mysterious space?\nQuestions flashed past Klein's mind, making him come up with several theories, but the final answer eluded him.\nDue to his fear of Adam, he believed that the best outcome for the Unshadowed Crucifix was to have the City of Silver's god-like Sealed Artifact shatter it and reform it into a pure Beyonder characteristic.\nReining in his thoughts and suppressing his questions, Klein conjured a new pen and paper and wrote down the knowledge he had learned from looking straight at the City of Silver Creator: \"Sequence 4: Unshadowed\n\"Main ingredients: One drop of the Sun's divine blood, or three adult Sun Divine Bird's feathers and a piece of Holy Brilliance Rock.\n\"Supplementary ingredients: 60ml of Sun Divine Bird's blood, 30 ml of Holy Brilliance Rock liquid. 7 drops of mutated fingered citron juice, 10 grams worth of powder of the heart of magma.\n\"Ritual: Extract the strongest emotions that one is most unwilling to abandon before consuming the potion. Inject these emotions back again during this process.\"\n\"Sequence 3: Justice Mentor...\n\"Sequence 4: Black Knight...\n\"Sequence 3: Trinity Templar...\"\nAfter doing all of this, Klein picked up the bronze cross again and observed it with a heavy expression.\nHe then threw Unshadowed Crucifix into the junk pile and stirred the powers of the mysterious space above the gray fog to suppress it. He didn't wish to see the paper figurines he cut begin to praise the Sun the next time he came.\nIn front of an ordinary house in Cherwood Borough.\nA postman riding a bike braked and stopped at the door.\nHe then settled down his bike and took out a letter from his bag, glancing to check if the address was correct.\n\"It's here... For Xio...\" The postman briskly walked to the mailbox and threw the letter in. Following that, he didn't delay as he got on his bike and kicked off.\nAfter a while, a pitch-black flame suddenly spewed out of the mailbox's mouth.\nThis flame burned quietly and quickly disappeared.\nIn Empress Borough, the opulent villa of Earl Hall.\nAudrey, who had brought Susie to the garden for a stroll, had just returned to the foyer when she saw her father, Earl Hall, come in from the outside. He had his brows knitted, seemingly in deep thought.\n\"Father, did something happen?\" Audrey asked with concern.\nThis was the most basic of observations which she didn't need to hide at all.\nEarl Hall restrained his frustrated expression and said with a smile, \"It's nothing important. I just never expected Hvin Rambis to be a member of a cult.\"\n\"He\u2018s a member of a cult?\" Audrey expressed her surprise appropriately.\nShe knew that Hvin Rambis was actually a member of the upper echelons of a secret organization known as the Psychology Alchemists, but she didn't understand how this was suddenly exposed.\nEarl Hall nodded solemnly.\n\"Yes, he's wanted by the three Churches. I'm still not sure which cult he's involved in.\"\n\"...Has he been caught?\" Audrey's eyes darted around as she asked \"curiously.\"\n__No, he disappeared before the warrant was issued.\" Earl sighed. __It_s really hard to imagine that he_s a cult member. He's of excellent character and is knowledgeable. He's rational and objective in various matters and is filled with wisdom.\"\nThat's just the side he wants you to see... Audrey inwardly mumbled. Then, as usual, she entered the small prayer room at home before dinner. She faced the Sacred Emblem of the Evernight Goddess and got into a prayer gesture.\nHowever, her low chanting was:\n\"The Fool that doesn't belong to this era...\"\nAfter chanting the honorific name, Audrey succinctly reported:\n\"Hvin Rambis has gone missing.\n\"He has been identified as a cultist and is wanted by all three Churches...\"\nWith that said, Audrey was about to solemnly pray to the Goddess when a boundless gray fog appeared before her.\nIn the middle of the grayish-white fog, a blurry figure sat on the chair, looking down from above and gently nodded. \"I'm aware.\"\nJust as this secret existence said that, the scene before Audrey's eyes changed suddenly. It presented a figure who was concentrating on praying.\n\"Honorable Mr. Fool, the Church of Evernight has obtained intelligence from Qonas Kilgor and confirmed that King George III hides an extremely huge secret. For the obtaining of a Blood Emperor ruins in the Sterlewen segment of the Tussock River, he colluded with the Demoness Sect and Psychology Alchemists to partake in human trafficking, creating the human disappearance cases that ultimately led to the Great Smog of Backlund...\n\"The Demoness Sect's former representative was Despair Nightingale Panatiya and was later changed to Saintess of White Katarina. For the Psychology Alchemists, it's Hvin Rambis...\n\"Please remind Miss Justice to be careful when she meets Hvin Rambis again. She needs to be constantly prepared to seek help.\"\nHis Majesty... Audrey's eyes widened as upheavals went through her heart. She found it difficult to control herself.\nThis was partly due to the fact that this news was shocking for a noble like her. In addition, it had to do with Lie which magnified her emotions.\nAlmost at the same time, a news report flashed in Audrey's mind. It was one that had left an unerasable impression on her:\n\"...According to preliminary estimates, a total of over 21,000 people died in the smog, and the subsequent plague took the lives of close to 40,000 people. Among the deceased were young children, healthy young men, and women...\"\nSo that's how it is... What is the king plotting... The three Churches likely don't have any actual evidence; otherwise, Father wouldn't only be frustrated to this degree... Audrey felt an inexplicable sense of anger and sadness. It felt like particular principles she had upheld in the past had been ruthlessly trampled, or that values that had stood up to time were silently crumbling.\nShe subconsciously lowered her head and closed her eyes.\nThen, she exhaled and whispered, \"Thank you, Mr. Fool. Please convey my gratitude to Mr. World.\"\nAfter her prayer, Audrey sat in the tranquil darkness and didn't move for a long time."}
{"num_chp":510,"summary":"Paavo Court...Cleves didn't directly answer the woman behind the telegraph office's door. He turned to glance at Gehrman Sparrow, waiting for his decision.\nIn the eyes of this former adventurer, it was a difficult task for fifteen people to get back to the White Agate safely. They couldn't and shouldn't be distracted by helping her search for someone. However, he was well aware that the current pillar of support was Gehrman Sparrow and Blazing Danitz. They were the only ones who had the right to decide on the matter.\nKlein remained silent for two seconds, then he spoke in a measured voice.\n\"What does he look like?\"\nHe believed that having more information would help him escape this strange, foggy city, so he casually asked in passing. As for whether he would help take note of the person's whereabouts, it all depended on what happened next.\nWhile inquiring, Klein also warned himself not to pursue the matter too deeply or else it might risk triggering the danger dormant in Bansy Harbor.\nBetween understanding the situation and avoiding the risks, he had to engage in a balancing act-no more, no less, without leaning too far left or right.\nThis might be an easy or difficult feat, because no one knew what would happen once he took the step. He could only judge based on his experience and intuition, and he could fall into a pit at any time. This left Klein highly stressed as his mind whirled at an unprecedented speed.\nIn the dense darkness and thin fog, the telegraph office's door remained tightly shut. The woman inside paused and said, \"He's... a very handsome... man.\n\"He has two eyes, two ears, a nose, and a mouth.\"\nWhy does this answer sound so scary.... Is there something wrong with this woman? According to the customs of Bansy Harbor, she shouldn't have even responded!Blazing Danitz had the urge to kick open the door, rush into the telegraph office, and check the situation inside.\nIt was at this moment that he saw Gehrman Sparrow put his hand on his hat and turn to the side.\n\"Storm cathedral,\" Klein briefly stated their destination.\nHe didn't bother with whether there was anything wrong with the woman at the telegraph office. It was just like how he didn't delve into the secrets of the owner of the Green Lemon Restaurant or the customers who had chosen to stay the night.\nThe wind was getting lighter, and the fog was thinning. The candlelight from the cathedral was shining through the narrow windows high above, like a beacon in a storm.\nAfter Klein used Sun Halo again, Donna and the others regained some of their courage, like people who had fallen into the water and desperately grabbed onto the last straw. They hurriedly walked on the empty streets in silence.\nSoon they arrived outside the Storm cathedral, but the doors were shut tight.\nGlancing at the Storm Sacred Emblem on the door, Klein raised his hand and knocked three times.\nThump! Thump! Thump!\nA vigilant male voice immediately came from behind the door.\n\"Who is it?\"\n\"Gehrman Sparrow,\" Klein replied straight away.\nHe could already tell that it was Captain Elland.\n\"Why are you here?\" Elland asked again without opening the door.\nKlein raised his cane and calmly said, \"You helped me pay White Shark's compensation.\"\nAfter a moment of surprise and amusement, Elland made an initial confirmation that it was the real Gehrman Sparrow outside. At the very least, even a monster adept at disguising wouldn't have known something that was privy only to the two of them.\nHe still felt hesitant until Cleves, Urdi Branch, Donna, and company sounded out in succession. Only then did he relax and allow his first mate, Harris, to unlock and open the door.\nA heavy clunking sound rang out, and Klein saw Elland in his boat-shaped hat, sword in one hand, and musket in the other.\n\"Something happened here too?\" he keenly asked, based on his conclusion from the situations from before.\nElland stepped aside to let Donna and the others in. Then he pointed at the prayer hall and said, \"The priest I knew, Jayce, died in there. He was decapitated, and Bishop Millet is nowhere to be found. Same for the other priests. Also, the servants in the church are all gone.\"\nA dead priest with a missing bishop? The whole cathedral is devoid of the living? This is a little problematic...Klein gripped the cold Azik's copper whistle, his heart sinking.\nOf course, he was very clear that the priest and the bishop weren't the main force of the Church of Storm that managed Beyonder matters in Bansy Harbor. Underneath this cathedral, there was definitely a Mandated Punisher team formed out of 6\u20138 Beyonders, as well as an indefinite number of Sealed Artifacts. Even High-Sequence Beyonders wouldn't be able to wipe out this force in a short span of time without causing a stir.\nAs long as they're alive and able to use Sealed Artifacts, the problem shouldn't be too terrible... So, at this point in time, what is the Mandated Punisher team doing?Based on his previous experience as a Nighthawk, Klein made a guess of the standard operating procedures.\nIn the process, he followed Elland to the prayer hall and examined the body of the deceased priest.\nJayce died a tragic death, as if his head had been decapitated while he was still alive. Unlike the monsters outside, his esophagus and head were separated.\nWith Klein's Spirit Vision, this priest no longer had any remnant spirit. It would be very difficult to have a successful spirit channeling ritual.\nIs it due to a unique killing technique, or has it been dealt with accordingly... It's different from the monsters outside. Was it because the operation happened in a rush?Combining all that he knew, Klein concluded his previous speculation.\nHe felt that there were two possibilities. One, there was something of local origins, perhaps a living Sealed Artifact or a Mid-Sequence Beyonder, who had lost control underground. It escaped the cathedral and killed Jayce while fleeing, causing the abnormal changes in Bansy Harbor. The bishop, priests, and Mandated Punishers were in desperate pursuit, attempting to form a seal again or get rid the perpetrator. The servants had been led underground and were under the protection of the remaining Mandated Punishers.\nBut this didn't explain the strange behavior of the residents of Bansy Harbor.\nThe second possibility was that the primitive sacrifice ritual to the God of Weather had been resurrected in a number of people in Bansy Harbor, and that the flying heads and headless monsters were in adherence with the descriptions of flesh and blood consumption in the sacrificial rituals and the burying of heads in the altar. And due to some unknown reason, this group of people had raided the cathedral and killed Reverend Jess. The rest of the population had more or less understood the situation, but they had opted for silence.\nThey might've already assaulted the area underground and are currently engaged in an intense battle with the Mandated Punishers, priests, and the bishop, who are aided by Sealed Artifacts. They might've transformed all the servants into monsters or thrown them out. It can also be that they're under pursuit from the Beyonders of the Church of Storms, and the servants have been sent underground to receive protection to prevent any accidents... From the fact that Jayce's corpse hasn't been used, there's a possibility that it's the latter development... If I were to head underground to confirm the situation, I'll definitely be attacked since we're unfamiliar Beyonders... Besides, the remnant strength might not be sufficient...Klein looked at the priest on the ground and realized that his Beyonder characteristic had condensed into a blue sapphire by his neck.\nHe retracted his gaze and didn't pick up the item. He didn't want to attract the violent retaliation from the short-tempered Church of Storms so he turned to Elland and Harris.\n\"Let's return to the ship first.\"\nHe casually tossed the gold coin and confirmed that there was no battle currently going on underground.\nIn any case, regardless of whether there were any Mandated Punishers present, the cathedral grounds were no longer suitable for prolonged stays. After all, Klein wasn't sure if his guess was right, and he could only make the safest choice.\n\"Alright!\" Elland had no desire to stay here either, being in a situation where he waited nervously for any changes to befall him.\nAs long as he returned to the White Agate, he would have many cannons and many sailors that could withstand accidents to a certain extent.\nAfter a short rest, the group left the cathedral.\nWith the addition of Elland and Harris, the team's defense clearly became much tighter. Klein no longer needed to toss the copper whistle to attract the monsters, so he stuffed it back into his pocket.\n\"Shall we send a telegram to the Church of Storms's headquarters to report on Bansy Harbor?\" After a few steps, Elland made a cautious suggestion.\nThis way, even if there were major unforeseen events, as long as they held on, they would eventually be saved.\nKlein didn't object. Walking through the thin fog ahead of him, he calmly said, \"We'll pass by the telegraph office.\"\nPhew.Blazing Danitz breathed a sigh of relief, then his heart skipped a beat.\nHe was afraid that the Church of Storms would perform investigations and discover that an infamous pirate had played an important role in this matter, and by then, he would probably still be trapped on the White Agate.\nAlthough I saved people, the Mandated Punishers aren't friendly to those who don't belong to them, especially when I'm a pirate...Stumped for a moment, Danitz decided to get over the immediate danger before considering other matters.\nAfter walking for a while, they saw the telegraph office in sight. A faint yellow light suddenly emerged from the side street and approached them from the depths of the fog.\nIt was a middle-aged man carrying a lantern.It was a middle-aged man carrying a hurricane lamp.\nHe wore a dark blue bishop robe embroidered with the symbol of the storm. His head was bowed and his face was pale. He was wheezing as he staggered while walking.\nElland focused and blurted out, \"Bishop Millet?\"\nThe middle-aged man looked up, raised his hurricane lamp and said,\"Elland, is it?\"\nAt this moment, Klein took a step back, letting Elland stand out. He didn't wish for the bishop of the Church of Storms to pay notice to him.\nDanitz even shrunk his neck back, using Urdi's plump body to block himself.\n\"Yes, Your Excellency. Jayce is dead. What happened?\" Elland wasn't a novice, so he didn't directly step forward.\nBishop Millet coughed and said, \"An old custom has been revived, and a group of heathens with dirty blood running through their veins are beginning to offer live sacrifices and are consuming their flesh and blood.\n\"Jayce noticed that they were problematic and ended up being killed by them.\n\"The matter can no longer be covered up. They used the sacrificial ritual to change the weather and tried to attack the cathedral. They were defeated by the Mandated Punisher and fled to the mountain. They escaped to the cave where the altar is.\n\"I was injured in combat. Without being able to hold out much longer, all I could do was slowly make my way back.\"\nJust as he finished speaking, a bright ball of light burst out of the distant fog, as if countless bolts of lightning were striking down.\nWith the help of this light, Klein and the others could see the fog-covered mountain range by the shore, as well as the peak which was connected to thunderstorms.\nTo a certain extent, this confirmed Bishop Millet's claim.\nElland was about to step forward to support the Storm bishop when he saw Gehrman Sparrow take out a gold coin and mutter in a low voice, \"He has ill intentions.\"\nDing!\nThe gold coin flew up and then tumbled in the air before landing in Klein's palm, heads facing up.\nIt meant a positive result!\nBishop Millet stared straight at this scene, his light brown eyes suddenly flashing with a dark red light."}
{"num_chp":1136,"summary":"Putting down the Classical Metallurgist potion formula, Klein cast his gaze towards the two tubes of blood Little Sun had sacrificed.\nThen, he beckoned for a ceramic jar wrapped in layers of paper figurines.\nThis was the Beyonder blood from different pathways that he had previously gathered. It had been placed above the gray fog and sealed with the Paper Angel in order to slowly integrate it into this mysterious space's aura, removing the connection between the blood and the individual. This was to prevent any accidents from happening to the provider when the door of the symbols was opened.\nTo him, it was fine if he suffered backlash. After all, there was at least one more chance of him reviving. If it would affect those who trusted him and gave their blood, he would rather not do it.\nAfter peeling off the paper figurines at the mouth of the jar and pouring the two tubes of blood into it, he conjured a glass stick and reached in to stir it.\nRight on the heels of that, he used Paper Angel and sealed it again.\nI'm just short of Prisoner, Devil, and Demoness... After I complete the ritual, I'll personally pay Miss Sharron a visit. It's better to make a request in person regarding such matters. It's too rude to do it by writing letters... Only Miss Magician is a little special. Clearly, she would prefer it if I wrote a letter rather than meet Gehrman Sparrow in person. Heh, she actually used the excuse that the ink had frozen due to the low temperatures to delay her writing. Heh, are her magic tricks just for show? Thankfully, my potion has already digested, so there's no need for me to push her anymore... Klein mumbled inwardly as he threw the ceramic jar covered in paper figurine back into the junk pile.\nAfter leaving the world above the gray fog, he didn't immediately prepare to advance to Scholar of Yore. Instead, he took out a pen and paper and drew the symbol that was a mixture of concealment and mystery prying.\nThis was something he had planned to do before he consumed the potion-to ask Arrodes about Sefirah Castle.\nAs the symbol took form, the light in the originally badly-lit room became darker, as if clouds were drifting past, blocking out the sun.\nAfter more than ten seconds, the full-body mirror with cracks suddenly rippled with aqueous light and silver words quickly appeared:\n\"Exalted Great Master, your devoted, loyal and humble servant, Arrodes, is here to answer your summoning.\n\"I-I am still the servant that you trust the most, the closest and most favorite, right?\"\nThis question... I seem to be able to read the panic and anxiety of this magic mirror... Does it feel a sense of danger? After some thought, he nodded in amusement.\n\"Yes.\"\nActually, that has never been the case... I'm just comforting you... After answering, he silently added in his heart.\nThe surface of the mirror lit up and the silver words were dyed golden.\nThey squirmed and formed a new sentence:\n\"Great Master, do you have any questions for me?\"\n\"Yes.\" Klein secretly tensed up. \"What do you know about Sefirah Castle?\"\nArrodes fell silent for a few seconds before the pale golden words changed:\n\"I don't know much about this. I've only heard some rumors. In the early days of the Second Epoch, the ancient gods believed that the original Creator left some things behind. That might be a \u2018kingdom' formed from a certain part of \u2018His' body or something created by \u2018Him.' And Sefirah Castle is one of them.\n\"This was the name that the King of Demonic Wolves, Flegrea, gave. \u2018He' calls the Hounds of Fulgrim as Sefirah Castle Keepers. However, \u2018He' failed to enter Sefirah Castle even to \u2018His' death. Therefore, many powerful creatures suspect that Sefirah Castle doesn't actually exist, but is just an abstract concept.\"\nIt had something to do with the original Creator? After pondering for a while, he said, \"One of them... How many other entities like Sefirah Castle are there?\"\n\"Eight. There are detailed records on the second Blasphemy Slate. Unfortunately, I haven't seen it.\" On the surface of the mirror, lines of words appeared one after another. However, the pale gold color faded away, becoming silver once again. \"The ancient gods suspect that the source of the underground corruption comes from a place similar to Sefirah Castle. They call it the Chaos Sea. Also, there are rumors that deep in the spirit world city, Calder\u00f3n City, there are clues to the River of Eternal Darkness. This comes from the ancient god, Phoenix Ancestor Gregrace. As for the others, I've heard of some names, but it's not a complete list. There's Tenebrous World, Knowledge Moor, as well as the Brood Hive that's related to the moon.\"\nThere are a total of eight. Chaos Sea, River of Eternal Darkness, Knowledge Moor, Tenebrous World, and Brood Hive... Brood Hive is related to the moon; it sounds very dangerous... I wonder if it has anything to do with the Mother Tree of Desire... Klein silently repeated the key information in Arrodes's response. He had a nagging feeling that he should be able to grasp something, but he didn't gain much from it. He even lacked the ability to piece together the clues.\nWhen he saw that Arrodes had only heard rumors and didn't have any actual understanding of them, he organized his thoughts and said with a smile, \"From the looks of it, you might come from the Chaos Sea.\"\n\"That's not important. What's important is that I'm your loyal, lowly, and obedient servant.\" Arrodes said the entire sentence at once.\nObedient, this use of words... Klein silently lampooned before asking, \"What are the origins of Dark Angel Sasrir?\"\nOn the surface of the mirror, silver words formed one after another:\n\"I similarly can't see it, but at that time, there was a myth that said that, when the ancient sun god was born, \u2018He' was light and darkness combined. After all, \u2018He' calls himself the Creator, so \u2018He' must be well-rounded and not lacking anything.\n\"Later, \u2018He' separated the darkness in his body and used it to create the first angel with one of his ribs, Dark Angel Sasrir.\"\nThis... rib... I can totally imagine it. Back then, it was the ancient sun god who personally fabricated and spread this myth... Amon's brother, your wife has become the Dark Angel! Klein was first alarmed before many strange ideas arose in his mind.\nAs his thoughts settled, he began to analyze the truth behind this myth.\nWith such a myth spreading, it will cause the believers to believe that Dark Angel Sasrir is the dark side of the ancient sun god. They would worship \"Him\" in the same way as the Lord. No one objected or forbade this myth. As for Dark Angel, \"He\" was ultimately the deputy of the divine kingdom, god's left hand. So this implies that this was very likely true...\nWhat happened afterward can be summarized as the dark side of the ancient sun god colluding with foreign enemies, bewitching the Kings of Angels and assassinating the main body?\nThis can explain why Ouroboros and Medici joined Rose Redemption. \"They\" were only following the orders of the \"Lord\"...\nFrom this angle, isn't the position of Dark Angel Sasrir, in the ancient sun god's divine kingdom, equivalent to The World of the Tarot Club? Hmm...\nThankfully, The World is a fake person. He doesn't have his own spirituality and thoughts...\nAs he thought about it, he suddenly felt drenched with sweat. He was glad that he was a Seer and not some other pathway.\nBased on his previous reasoning, he quickly guessed the reason why Dark Angel was sleeping in the Giant King's Court.\nPerhaps it has something to do with the fall of the ancient sun god...\nTherefore, the brother of Amon, the Dragon of Wisdom, and the True Creator wish to confirm the state of Dark Angel Sasrir...\nHowever, there are many other problems... In the twenty-two Beyonder pathways, which pathway is this King of Angels, the left hand of God?\nThe Marauder has Amon, Apprentice has Mr. Door, Spectator, Reader, Bard, Sailor, Secrets Suppliant, Warrior, Sleepless, Planter, Savant, Monster, Hunter, and Arbiter are obviously impossible... Corpse Collector is also impossible due to the existence of Death in the Fourth Epoch. It's impossible for there to be a King of Angels to exist at the same time-unless the Dark Angel had already fallen to Sequence 2... By the same logic, the Seer and Lawyer pathways can be eliminated for now. It can then be confirmed that the Dark Angel is no longer a King of Angels...\nMystery Pryer, Moon, and Devil are all certain possibilities. I cannot eliminate the possibility that the Hidden Sage, Primordial Moon, and the Dark Side of the Universe are the Dark Angel's \"alt\"... Yes, there might still be the Mother Tree of Desire hidden within...\nIt's also possible with Prisoner. There's no clear evidence that this pathway has produced a true deity. Back then, the Chained God might not even be a King of Angels.\nAfter some thought, he said to Arrodes, \"It's your turn to ask.\"\nOn the cracked full-body mirror's surface, silver words twisted together and formed a new sentence:\n\"Great Master, may I guess what you want to ask next?\"\n\"...\" Klein nodded slightly and answered, \"Sure.\"\n\"You wish to ask about Sasrir's current state. My answer is, I don't know, as I can't see.\" Behind the silver words was a smiley face with a simple drawing.\n\"Not bad,\" Klein praised. \"That's all for today. I will summon you again in the near future at any time.\"\n\"Yes, Great Master. Your loyal servant, Arrodes, is constantly preparing to serve you!\" On the surface of the mirror, the simple smile on his face turned into a waving cat's paw.\nWhen the mirror returned to normal, Klein took out a pen and paper and wrote down what he had just learned.\nThis was one of the documents he had prepared for the Scholar of Yore ritual.\nIn the past few days, he had written a lot of documents on ancient history.\nFollowing that, with the information and two marionettes, he \"Teleported\" to the Southern Continent.\nHe didn't dare to advance in Backlund. If anything were to happen to him, Amon and Zaratul would definitely be able to detect it and come straight for him!"}
{"num_chp":405,"summary":"\"The Fool?\" The Beyonders who attended Mr. A's gathering either ruminated over the phrase or conversed with their companions to discuss whether they had ever met anyone who had a similar faith.\n\"When did such a cult appear?\" someone asked in a low voice.\nAt this point, Mr. A made the attendant beside him hold up a blackboard with a few lines of words written in the Loen language.\n\"The Fool that doesn't belong to this era.\n\"The mysterious ruler above the gray fog.\n\"The King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck.\"\nAs the attendees examined the blackboard, Mr. A said in a hoarse and jarring voice, \"Do not use Hermes to read what's written here.

It wouldn't be in this format!\" A gathering member who was well-versed in mysticism gave an explanation.\nAs they vehemently conversed, Fors was nearly dumbfounded.\nIsn't that the honorific name of Mr. Fool? Even though it's described in the Loen language, I'm sure of it! Why would Mr. A want to find the believers of Mr. Fool? Is the Aurora Order behind this?Fors's mind was in a mess.\nShe knew that Mr. A was a member of the Aurora Order because of a particular \"terrorist organization\" had announced its responsibility in the assassination of Intis Ambassador Bakerland.\nAfter a brief moment of astonishment, Fors subconsciously began to examine herself, afraid that someone would discover that she was already a member of the Tarot Club and that, in some sense, she was an adorer of The Fool.\nI just recited the honorific name of The Fool according to the ancient Hermes on that piece of paper and was pulled above the gray fog. No one knows about this, and I don't have to be afraid of being investigated... But there's a link to that piece of paper with Mr. Fool's honorific name written on it. It was hidden in a book we borrowed from the Viscount Glaint...Thoughts rapidly flashed through Fors's mind.\nThe Fool that doesn't belong to this era... Isn't that the description I saw on that piece of paper? I even dreamed of an evil spirit!At the same time, Xio remembered the incident that had frightened her, but her long experience as a bounty hunter had kept her from revealing anything unusual.\nAnd then, as she recalled, she thought about the origin of the piece of paper.\nIt was hidden in the bookcase of \"History of the Loen Kingdom's Aristocracy\"... That book was borrowed from Viscount Glaint's study...\nSuddenly, a name flashed in both Fors's and Xio's minds at the same time:Viscount Glaint!\nAt that moment, Viscount Glaint was looking at the blackboard and said to himself with interest, \"This honorific name is very rare.\n\"But it sounds very impressive!\"\nJust as he finished his sentence, he looked to his side in puzzlement, asking Fors and Xio, \"Why are you looking at me like that?\"\n\"Nothing.\" Xio and Fors rapidly shook their heads at the same time.\n...\nAfter dinner, in an elegantly decorated house.\nAudrey brought the huge golden retriever, Susie, into the living room under the guidance of her psychology teacher, Escalante. She was attending the \"academic\" meeting that had been agreed upon last week.\nHer maid and bodyguard stayed behind while she walked with Susie into a spacious activity room.\nIn the activity room, be it for the atmosphere or some other reason, the gas lamps were not lit. The room was lit by gold-plated candle lamps on the coffee table and cupboard.\nBefore Audrey could take a good look at her surroundings, she saw a gentleman in his thirties walking towards her. He wore a gray tailcoat.\n\"This is the owner of this place, Mr. Stephen Hampres, a furniture merchant.\" the long-haired Escalante introduced him.\nShe was just about to tell him Audrey's identity when Hampres chuckled and said, \"Escalante, don't say anything. Let me have a chance at guessing.\"\nHe had a neatly trimmed mustache and charming dark brown eyes. He appeared very gentle and elegant, nothing like a furniture merchant but more like a university lecturer.\nAfter seriously sizing up Audrey a few times, he smiled and said, \"Escalante only mentioned that you were her student. Heh heh, I believe you're a cultured noble lady, and you aren't someone who only looks good. There's no need for you to worry about a decline in the quality of your life...\n\"You're a little excited, very curious, and a relatively simple but also full of love...\n\"Of course, the most obvious point is that you're very beautiful, just like an angel!\"\nHe made a final joke, pressed his hand to his chest, bowed, and said, \"Welcome, the beautiful Miss Angel.\"\nYou're right, as expected of a member of the Psychology Alchemists. However, what you managed to observe was the me from a few months ago. It's all a facade I've put on for myself...Audrey opened her mouth in surprise and astonishment.\n\"Did you know me before, Mr. Hampres?\"\nShe didn't let her shocked expression linger too long on her face, because such emotions were meant to be instantaneous and wouldn't last too long.\nIf anyone were to be surprised for several seconds, then it meant that their performance was most likely an act.\nAudrey didn't notice this at first, but after watching others \"act\" all this time, she naturally came up with a lot of rules.\n\"No, I still don't know you. This is just the basics of being a psychology enthusiast.\" Hampres chuckled.\nBefore he could finish his sentence, Audrey had already completed her observations and made a corresponding judgment based on her surroundings.\nHis attire and the furnishings of his house all indicate that he's a person who cares deeply about how people view him...\nThe sapphire on the ring of his left hand doesn't look small, but its actual quality is very ordinary. There are no symbols or magic labels on it... His finances aren't as good as he presents them to be... He's vain...\nEven though he was very enthusiastic just now, the way he stands there, the direction in which his feet point, and the changes in his emotional colors all indicate that he still has many concerns and is on his guard...\nHe sincerely commended me on my looks, but it wasn't in the way a man would look at a woman. There are signs of him using facial products, and his eyebrows are definitely drawn. His skills are inferior to my make-up maidservant, Solia, but they're better than mine... The cologne he uses is \"Confusion,\" something that I've only seen women use before... Yes, he probably likes men, and the role he plays is the weaker one in the relationship...\nAt the same time, Audrey expressed her longing skillfully.\n\"I'd love to have your observational powers, Mr. Hampres.\"\nAs she spoke, she maintained a faint smile while being introduced to the other seven or eight people in the activity room under Hampres's and Escalante's lead.\nThe lovers of both mysticism and psychology were either descendants of fallen aristocrats, associate professors at universities, or the children of the rich. For example, the father of a young man was the owner of Philip's Department Store, the most famous department store in Backlund.\nIn the exchange that followed, Audrey basically only listened. The only time she spoke was by asking questions, fully expressing her curiosity and yearning.\nIn this \"academic\" discussion, Escalante and Hampres deliberately mentioned the Body of Heart and Mind, as well as the spirit world and the collective subconscious. They also shared some relatively unique points of view, allowing Audrey to gradually understand some of the questions she had accumulated all this time.\nWhen the discussion ended and they were out of the house, Audrey glanced at Escalante beside her and asked, with a little naivety, \"Ms. Escalante, when will I-I be as good in psychology as Mr. Hampres?\"\nEscalante curled the corners of her lips and slightly tilted her head as she looked at her.\n\"Very soon...\"\n...\nAt night, Klein, who was about to get into bed, once again appeared above the gray fog.\nDespite being a little sleepy, he was jolted awake by the news Miss Magician had reported.\nThe Aurora Order knows of The Fool? They know of my honorific name? The True Creator has locked onto me?Klein abruptly sat up straight, as though he was about to face an attack.\nHe quickly rejected the final theory. If the True Creator had indeed locked onto him, Mr. A would have long visited him on the pretext of collecting a copper penny for the gas meter. Perhaps, even a Saint might appear.\nThat is to say, only The Fool and his corresponding honorific name are known, and the clues point to Backlund... Who leaked the news?Klein frowned as he carefully thought about it.\nSoon, he discovered a possibility.\nLittle Sun has recently chanted my honorific name, and it happened when he was interacting with a member of the exploratory team who was corrupted by the True Creator... He held a sacrificial ritual, and there were likely symbols corresponding to The Fool at the scene. The ancient palace above the gray fog appeared.... So, the True Creator sensed the existence of The Fool and confirmed that I was the one who had been sacrilegious, no-harassing, no that's not right either-spying on him...\nAlso, Little Sun used the All-Black Eye at that time, which contains the mental corruption of the True Creator... Through that, \"He\" has confirmed that my adorers and believers are in Backlund?\nI can't take the All-Black Eye out in the future!\nHaving roughly understood the problem, Klein was left with another problem.\nMr. A announced the bounty for Mr. Fool's believers at a not-so-private, relatively open Beyonder gathering. Is he just dumb, or is he deliberately \"fishing?\"\nSigh, the Aurora Order members are all bigoted lunatics. Their brains are mostly damaged, so it's impossible to deduce their real intentions!\nThis is as the saying goes, as long as I'm crazy, you won't be able to guess what I'm thinking?"}
{"num_chp":576,"summary":"Is she suspecting something?Klein looked straight into Edwina's eyes without moving them away. Nor did his eyes blink or dodge.\nAfter knowing that Danitz had divulged his sacrificial ritual to Kalvetua before it died, Klein had the necessary preparations. If he wasn't standing on the shipboard and was instead sitting on a soda, then he definitely would've crossed his right leg and leaned back to give a calm and composed answer.\nHe smiled as he raised his left hand. He introduced with a calm tone, \"This glove of mine is called Creeping Hunger.\"\nKlein believed that Danitz, who had witnessed him in combat, had definitely passed the relevant details on to his captain. Therefore, with Vice Admiral Iceberg Edwina being of equal rank as Vice Admiral Hurricane Qilangos, it wasn't difficult for her to guess that he had acquired Creeping Hunger. In that case, taking the initiative to divulge it gave him a psychological advantage rather than being exposed by her.\nAnd for him to suddenly mention it gave it a double meaning. First, he was hinting to her that he had an organization backing him, one that could kill Vice Admiral Hurricane and orchestrate Kalvetua's death and reply to its believers in its stead. Second, it was a warning for Edwina that she was not to attempt to investigate or delve deeper into the matter. Otherwise, the instantaneous death of Vice Admiral Hurricane awaited her.\nAt this moment in time, Klein continued maintaining Gehrman Sparrow's persona. He didn't directly threaten her or refuse to admit it. Instead, he provided a calm answer that hid madness within it.\nEdwina Edwards nodded slightly and suddenly changed topics.\n\"I plan on providing a certain amount of assistance to the Resistance in the Rorsted Archipelago, mainly in food and fabric.\"\nAssistance? Her backing faction is against Loen, or it just wants to make things difficult for the Church of Storms?Klein wiped his smile and calmly replied, \"This has nothing to do with me.\"\nDon't expect me to trip up...he said silently to himself.\nEdwina turned her head and raised her arm to point to Blazing Danitz who was drinking while secretly stealing glances.\n\"I will entrust him to handle it, including contacting the Resistance and confirming the time. We'll arrange for a private harbor, and I wish you can provide sufficient help.\"\nPfft...Danitz spewed out a golden waterfall from his mouth.\nHaha. Pfft! Bam! Bam! Bam!The two pirates sitting beside him laughed as they bent their backs and struck the deck, spewing out the beer that they had just drunk.\nOne of them had dark skin like he was covered in a layer of metal skin. His waist was rather thick, and although he wasn't fat, he had no curvature to speak of.\nEdwina retracted her gaze and added in an unhurried manner before Klein could speak, \"You're an adventurer. I believe you won't decline a job that pays well.\"\nYou really have found me an excellent excuse...Klein smiled in response.\n\"Of course.\"\nHe didn't ask how much the payment was, while Edwina seemed to forget mentioning it.\nThis intelligent and beautiful pirate admiral gloomily said, \"Senor got someone to pass me the news that he's willing to buy the key of the giants, which I previously discovered, for 5,000 pounds.\"\nIt was the item proclaimed to be Death's Key. It was a gigantic black iron key that nearly made Danitz lose his life in Bayam. Klein suspected that it didn't originate from the dark Second Epoch, but it was something that was connected to the Giant King's Court.\nShe's hinting at me to offer a price?Klein was first taken aback before he came to a realization. He couldn't help but inwardly mumble,5,000 pounds? I don't even know if the key is of any use, or if it really involves the Giant King's Court! If it doesn't have anything to do with it, can I return it for a refund?\nBesides, there's no prior information about it. Even if I take it above the gray fog to divine it, I wouldn't receive any effective revelations.\nYes, a simple inference is that if it doesn't involve the Giant King's Court but some other treasure that I have no idea about, then it would be useless if I buy it. The only benefit is that it will disrupt Admiral of Blood's plans. It harms him without benefiting me. If it involves the Giant King's Court, Admiral of Blood is unlikely to find the target location even if he bought it, as it's located in the Forsaken Land of the Gods. Besides, I plan to hunt him. When the time comes, I can obtain the key without spending any money. It's equivalent to having him buy it for me and watch over it for some time.\nAlthough such thoughts are very idealistic, it's not impossible...\nKlein pondered for a few seconds and said, \"It might be hiding a huge secret.\"\nHe deliberately mentioned this to make Vice Admiral Iceberg unwilling to sell the gigantic black iron key to Admiral of Blood Senor. It was to prevent the latter from rapidly strengthening himself after obtaining the treasure and step into the demigod realm. That would bring a considerable calamity upon Klein.\nEdwina listened silently and didn't continue on the topic. She turned her body halfway around and pointed at the cabin's entrance.\n\"Breakfast has been prepared for you.\"\n\"Thank you.\" Klein took off his hat and bowed.\nAs he followed Vice Admiral Iceberg into the cabin, he quickly recalled the conversation they just had and sought out the true motive behind Edwina's invitation.\nFrom Gehrman Sparrow's identity problems, to the mystical item suspected to be Creeping Hunger, to the matter of the sacrifice to Kalvetua while the dead Sea God continued responding to believers, all of these matters put together does allow one to imagine that I have a secret organization backing me, one whose motives are unknown.\nAs for the faction that Vice Admiral Iceberg belongs to, it's very wary, guarded, and interested in this matter. Therefore, it got her to probe me in person to see if they can obtain something?\nThey're still rather friendly at the moment. Extending their assistance to the Resistance is a way to convey their intentions. It seems they're leaning towards cooperating with the organization backing me. Of course, the unknown always leaves others afraid. Without grasping the situation, the chances of Vice Admiral Iceberg and company attacking me is very, very low.\nHeh heh, if they realize that the secret organization backing me was established only about half a year ago, including The World and Miss Xio, whose connection has been established but not recruited, there aren't more than ten people. I wonder if they will get so infuriated that they end up losing control...\nAs his thoughts raced, Klein entered the cabin and followed a dim passageway, passing through one wooden door after another.\nHe followed Edwina up some stairs and arrived at a brighter second level.\nBefore entering the pirate's dining hall, they passed by a half-opened room.\nKlein casually glanced inside and saw a gigantic black iron key sitting on a wooden table.\n\"These items are evidence from our various treasure-hunting expeditions. Most of them are mementos, while others have yet to show their value and require further study.\" Edwina appeared cold, but her explanations were in great detail. It had the feeling like she was afraid that he wouldn't understand her or was left puzzled.\nAnd when she mentioned the word \"study,\" her aqueous blue eyes clearly lit up a little.\nEvidence of the various treasure-hunting expeditions?Klein couldn't help but look inside carefully.\nAt this point, Edwina pushed open the door and walked in. She then introduced in passing, \"This is a gold coin from the Fourth Epoch's Solomon Empire.\"\nKlein's gaze shifted over and saw a coin placed inside a frame.\nIt was entirely dark gold in color, as though it was combined from two semicircles of different dimensions. It looked extremely asymmetrical, and there was a sharp crown engraved on its surface. It looked very similar to the crown worn on the King of the Five Seas, Nast.\nEdwina was like an owner who liked to flaunt her collection. She began introducing the items in the room, making Klein recall a familiar person-Old Mister Eye of Wisdom, the great detective, Isengard Stanton.\nIn regards to the trait of flaunting collections, they're very similar... Is this a tendency of people with huge collections? Wait, Mr. Stanton had studied in Lenburg for four years. Vice Admiral Iceberg's description includes information that Edwina Edwards that hails from Lenburg. This... Lenburg's capital is the headquarters of the Church of the God of Knowledge and Wisdom. Mr. Stanton also admitted that he converted his faith to the God of Knowledge and Wisdom while studying abroad... Could the faction backing Vice Admiral Iceberg be them?Klein listened in thought until Edwina stopped in front of the huge iron black key.\nJust like he had seen in the dream, the key was about the size of a seven-string zither. An ordinary human would have to wrap their arms around it to move it. It was dull and ancient-looking.\nThe patterns on it are similar to the City of Silver's style. It clearly has giant traits...Klein nodded and was just about to retract his gaze when he heard Edwina say, \"You can study it.\"\nYou are letting me study it? You probably have no idea how many latent problems I've triggered in the past. Aren't you afraid that the Golden Dream will disappear once you let me study it...Klein criticized himself in a self-deprecatory manner before reaching out his right hand to touch the black iron key that seemed to belong to a giant's.\nHe found it ice-cold to the touch, and regardless of how much spirituality he injected into it, it was useless.\nUnfortunately, I cannot bring it above the gray fog to study it...Klein retracted his right hand and shook his head indiscernibly.\nHe shifted his gaze onto a book in goatskin placed on the same table. On the brown cover were words written in ancient Feysac: \"Groselle's Travels.\"\n\"It originates from a sunken ship. It had been soaked at the bottom of the sea for 165 years without suffering any damage,\" Edwina introduced. \"It records a story about a giant named Groselle. He had decided to head to the Nation of Frost to hunt the King of the North, a powerful frost dragon. Along the way, he encounters companions, a female elf, a devout ascetic, an aristocrat of the Solomon Empire, and a Loen soldier. The story develops until they encounter the King of the North before it suddenly comes to a halt. It's not the end, but the later pages cannot be opened no matter what methods are used. You can give it a try.\"\nThis isn't a notebook in a journal style, but rather a novel? This novel sure is odd. It puts together characters from different epochs and eras. It should be something that was recently produced...Klein flipped through the book and allowed the yellowish-brown pages to slide past one after another.\nThe content was roughly what Edwina said, but the story appeared rather abrupt and fractured. It kept making Klein suspect if he had missed a paragraph. For example, the protagonists would become familiar with one another moments after encountering each other as strangers.\nSoon, he browsed to the last few pages and found that they were stuck together. There was no way he could pry them apart.\nSuch effects... probably can be dealt with above the gray fog... I wonder what sort of accidents might happen...Klein turned his head to look at Vice Admiral Iceberg.\nEdwina fell silent for a moment before saying, \"If you wish to have it, I can sell it to you. I've studied it for years without gleaning anything from it.\n\"However, I have a condition.\n\"What is it?\" Klein returned with a question.\nEdwina pursed her lips and said, \"If you figure out something, you have to tell me the result, so that I won't have to be puzzled over it.\n\"As long as you agree to this condition, I can sell it to you for cheap.\"\nKlein's interest was suddenly piqued.\n\"How much?\"\n\"8,000 pounds,\" Edwina said calmly.\n\"Uh...\" Klein deliberately pondered as he nodded indifferently. \"I'll consider it.\"\nI'll consider how to pretend that this never happened...he thought silently to himself."}
{"num_chp":329,"summary":"Backlund Bridge area, Bravehearts Bar.\nKlein pressed down the cap on his head, carefully protecting the wallet in the inside pocket of his grayish-blue worker's jacket. He walked around the customers who were surrounding the boxing ring and headed for the bar.\nOn the way, he looked around and didn't see the black market arms dealer, Kaspars Kalinin.\nHe's either playing cards or playing billiards...Klein nodded to himself, sat down at the bar, and said to the bartender, \"Half and Half.\"\nHe had seen someone drink this type of alcoholic beverage the last time, and he felt that it likely suited his palate.\nAt least it's better than pure malt beer...Klein thought to himself.\nThe bartender raised his head and glanced at him.\n\"Which two alcohols do you want mixed? Different choices, different prices.\"\n\"The typical one; the typical one will do.\" The last time he saw someone drink it, the person had used alcohol of the worst quality. The whole glass of Half and Half was only worth two and a half pence.\n\"Four and a half pence.\" The bartender watched as Klein arranged the brass coins on the bar and then went back to mixing. He said in passing, \"You here for Kaspars? He's not here anymore; his business has been snatched.\"\n\"Huh?\" Klein didn't expect such an answer.\nBefore the bartender could reply, a man with a protruded mouth next to him laughed and said, \"Yes, we've chased Kaspars away!\n\"Heh, how can a lame old man like him do such a business?\n\"If you have anything you need, feel free to come to us. Find our boss.\"\nA gang war?Klein subconsciously came up with this idea, wanting to reject the man's suggestion.\nHowever, he soon thought of another possibility.\nCould it be that the Rose School of Thought has deliberately sought out a gang to suppress Kaspars so as to force Maric and Miss Sharron to jump into a trap?\nYes, it's quite possible. Kaspars had been working here as a black market arms dealer for a long time; he's definitely not someone who can be chased away just like that. A while ago, because of the series of murders, the atmosphere in the whole of Backlund was rather tense, and the Rose School of Thought or other hidden factions wouldn't dare to recklessly kill and use spirit mediumship on Maric and Miss Sharron, even if they found them. This would result in a lot of bloodshed, and since they obviously only have a few suspects, and are unable to confirm anyone else having a way to contact Miss Sharron and Maric for the time being...Klein swallowed the words he was about to say and asked instead, \"Can I first get a quote before deciding whether to purchase?\"\nHe planned to observe the faction made up of ordinary people who had taken over Bravehearts Bar's black market. If he discovered any problems, then he could use them as a favor to give to Kaspars, Sharron, and Maric.\nIn any case, Klein didn't want any conflict. He only planned on observing via normal processes, so there was no risk.\n\"Yes, the only requirement is...\" The man made a zipping motion with his hand in front of his protruding mouth.\n\"No problem.\" As soon as Klein answered, he saw the Half and Half in front of him, and the copper coins had been taken away by the bartender.\nWithout any intention of wasting it, he tipped his head and drank it. His brows gradually furrowed.\nIt's not what I thought it would be. The taste of the spirit is too heavy, the grape flavors are too mild...Klein put down his glass and followed the man to the third billiard room where Kaspars used to stay in.\nWhen he was about to reach the door, he suddenly thought of something.\nAs someone who doesn't know much, even I can guess that this is a trap. I wonder if Miss Sharron and Maric who have been hunted for so long know about it? They definitely wouldn't appear...\nHowever, Kaspars knows more than one Beyonder. He has connections with several different circles of Beyonders, and he might be able to get other helpers. That would complicate things.\nAt that moment, the man with the protruding mouth stopped at the doorway of the billiard room, and the distracted Klein almost bumped into him.\nHe pointed inside and said, \"Don't talk nonsense later. Our boss doesn't have a good temper.\n\"Everyone in the Backlund Bridge area and East Borough knows this.\"\n\"Alright.\" Klein nodded.\nSatisfied, the man with the protruding mouth turned and pushed open the billiard room's door.\nAs the door opened, Klein saw a figure hanging in the air, gently swaying.\nIt was a burly man with a full beard. There was a rope tied around his neck, a rope that was tied in a dead knot.\nHis feet were off the ground, the tip of his tongue was protruding out, and his face was purple. He wore a contorted expression.\n\"Boss...\" the man with the protruding mouth cried out in disbelief.\nAs soon as the tension in Backlund's atmosphere disappears, someone takes action...Klein tilted his head and glanced at the subordinate, he then solemnly drew a triangular Sacred Emblem on his chest.\n\"May he find peace with God.\n\"I hope his temper is cured as a result.\"\nThe man with the protruded mouth didn't even hear what he said. He suddenly shouted, \"Boss!\n\"Murder!\n\"Boss is dead!\"\nKlein took two steps back as a result of the loud and shrill voice, and he also activated his Spirit Vision to take a look inside the room. There was nothing special other than the scattered billiard balls all over the place.\nDid a Beyonder from Kaspars do it? What would the faction who planted the trap do? If there was actually such a trap...Klein quietly moved away and slunk away into the crowd when the other gang members swarmed over.\nHe glanced at the kitchen of the Bravehearts Bar and, with some thought, went over and familiarly passed through to the back door.\nAs soon as he pushed open the not-so-heavy wooden door, Klein felt a cold wind blowing against him which caused him to shiver.\nAnd amidst the cold wind was the faint smell of blood.\nHe listened for a moment but saw nothing. He took out his penny and flicked it up.\nThe landing sound was cut off by the wind, and Klein looked down at the copper penny in his palm, confirming that it was heads.\nPutting the coin away, he carefully walked forward, heading in the direction that his spiritual perception told him to.\nHe walked to a dark corner where there wasn't any illumination from the street lamps. The smell of blood suddenly became stronger.\nWith the help of the weak moonlight that penetrated through the clouds, Klein almost gasped when he saw what was in front of him.\nThe floor here was littered with bloody thighs, calves, boots, ribs, a heart, arms, eyeballs, and other human parts. On the wall hung a portion of pale red intestines. The background was a large patch of bright red with milky white markings.\nSeeing this, Klein felt like he was looking at a slaughterhouse, a slaughterhouse specially prepared for humans.\nIs the murderer afraid that the Nighthawks, Mandated Punishers, and the others are too idle? This is so exaggerated that the police would immediately transfer the case to them...Klein muttered in his mind to resist the discomfort caused by the scene.\nHe walked around the blood and approached the opposite wall. To his surprise, there were quite a few deep scratches.\nIt was like a thick and sharp claw that forcefully scratched out a mark!\nThe claw is similar to the one the Devil dog had after its transformation. Could it be that there's another one? Could it not be dead yet? No, no, no, I know what's going on...Klein suddenly came to a realization.\nThe deceased must be the Beyonder who killed the bar's gang leader. He was finished off by the faction who had set the trap...\nAccording to Little Sun's description, I've always suspected that the faction is the Rose School of Thought because they grasp the Prisoner pathway, which is also the mutant pathway.\nAnd one type of mutant was the werewolf!\nThis was in line with the traces of the crime scene before him.\nIt also indirectly proves that Miss Sharron and Maric are defectors of the Rose School of Thought...\nKlein calmly retreated out of the scene, one step at a time.\nDuring this process, he confirmed that there weren't any Beyonder characteristics present. Of course, it was possible that it hadn't appeared yet.\nThen he turned and walked towards another street, intending to get someone to inform the police, lest such a scene frighten the commoners and make them suspect that Backlund had been infiltrated by some ferocious beast.\nBecause he didn't want to get into trouble over greed, Klein didn't wait for the possibility of a Beyonder characteristic appearing.\nJust as he reached the end of the alley, he suddenly saw a brown carriage slowly approaching in the night.\nThe carriage didn't continue to move forward like the other carriages. Instead, it stopped right in front of Klein!\nKlein narrowed his eyes as he prepared to do battle. However, whether it was his spirituality intuition as a Seer or the battle sense of a Clown, neither of them gave him a warning.\nAt this moment, the window of the carriage was opened, revealing a pale face which wore a hint of madness to it. Its brown eyes seemed to conceal deep malice.\nMaric...Klein recognized him.\nIt was Maric, Miss Sharron's companion who controlled zombies!\nHe was only wearing a white shirt and a black vest, and he didn't seem to be afraid of the cold at all. He gestured for Klein to board the carriage.\nFor a moment Klein hesitated, wanting to use his spirit pendulum to divine right there on the spot.\nAt this moment, a figure appeared behind Maric. She wore a complex black regal dress and a small, soft hat. It was the blonde Miss Sharron with blue eyes.\nShe can easily do me harm if she wants to. She can directly come out from the wall behind me...Klein thought for a moment, then he deliberately took two steps forward casually. He opened the carriage door and took note of it.\nAfter he sat down, the carriage began to move slowly. It was unknown where its destination was.\n\"Why did you come here?\" Sharron asked simply.\nKlein answered frankly, \"I wanted to contact the both of you and ask if you have any books on mysticism. It would be best if they went in-depth. As you know, I lack such knowledge.\"\nMaric continued looking over with malice-filled eyes as he said in a slightly hoarse and low voice, \"We do have a lot of knowledge regarding mysticism, such as Shaman King Klarman's Book of Secrets, but what can you use to trade for it?\"\nShaman King? Which pathway and Sequence is that?As these thoughts flashed past his mind, Klein deliberated his tone and said, \"I can trade for it with gold pounds.\n\"Or do you need anything else?\"\nThe pale, but exquisite-looking Sharron looked at him and replied stoically, \"Help.\n\"We'll use your help as barter.\""}
{"num_chp":1143,"summary":"I can only maintain it for about a minute or so... That's way too short, isn't it? A thought flashed through Klein's mind. Without thinking about anything else, he took two steps to the desk.\nHe put down Groselle's Travels and quickly wrote on a piece of paper with 0-08:\n\"George III plans to use this speech to bait out all his enemies who want to sabotage his ritual. However, if everything goes smoothly and nothing happens, he'll take the opportunity to consume the potion and reveal his trump card to aim for divinity. After all, there are too many unknowns in the future, making it unsafe. Furthermore, he has made appropriate preparations for the ritual, they're already prepared to an adequate level.\n\"This is a very reasonable development.\"\nAfter Klein wrote the last sentence, and before he could check if there was anything wrong with the written content, the dim quill in his hand disappeared without a trace, as though it had never existed.\nAnd those few words seemed to drain all of his energy, making him feel dizzy. He took a few steps back and collapsed into his chair.\nIt doesn't make sense... It wasn't exhausting for Ince Zangwill back then... Uh, it should be because I forcefully summoned it, and I didn't dare let 0-08 weave a story on its own. When I wrote on the piece of paper, I had to rely on my own spirituality to support it. As for Ince Zangwill, he could get 0-08's cooperation, so it wasn't that draining... Klein closed his eyes and used Cogitation for a while before feeling better.\nUnder normal circumstances, having had no physical contact with 0-08 and merely meeting it once had made it impossible for him to summon this Grade 0 Sealed Artifact. However, on the one hand, he had the Snake of Fate to personally augment his luck, and on the other hand, he had Groselle's Travels. This was the item left behind by the Dragon of Imagination Ankewelt. Inside it was the City of Miracles, Liveseyd. It had a connection to a certain degree to an existence like 0-08. If it wasn't for some high-level existence's disruption, these two items would've long been reunited.\nKlein didn't know if this fate and particular connection could increase the chances of a successful summoning. He only wanted to give it a try since he didn't stand to lose anything. To his surprise, he really succeeded.\nAnd it was precisely because of this that he didn't dare to use Groselle's Travels to bear the contents of 0-08's projection. He didn't even dare to let them come close, afraid that something irreversible would happen.\nThis was Backlund, which had an extremely dense population!\nYes, logically speaking, there shouldn't be any accidents. After all, 0-08 is a Historical Void projection. It's fake. Groselle's Travels was conjured by the Dragon of Imagination, and it's also fake. A fake combination can't be real in any way. They lack the foundation of a Beyonder characteristic... I can go back to the uninhabited reef island to test it... Klein rubbed his temples and returned to the desk. There, he began reading what he had just written.\nHe didn't directly write that George III would be unsuccessful in his advancement and die on the spot. He believed that if he interfered with a Sequence 1 angel, the projection of 0-08 wouldn't be able to be so direct. He had to be more tactful.\nFurthermore, there was also the Psychology Alchemists and Amon's brother. Overly obvious effects would definitely be detected and easily made use of. All he could do was beat about the bush to mitigate the unknown.\nI hope it works... After staring at it for a while, he folded the piece of paper and stuffed it into his pocket.\nThen, he sacrificed Groselle's Travels back above the gray fog.\nAfter doing all of this, Klein began to consider another problem. It was when he would head out to buy some ice-cream for Will Auceptin.\nBacklund has Zaratul, and it's very possible that Amon is there. If I head out too frequently, we might run into each other. It's a little dangerous... Why don't I summon some ice-cream for Will from the Historical Void? It's very real when eating it, and it'll disappear in fifteen minutes. There's no need to worry about gaining weight at all. It's just splendid... Klein couldn't help but mumble inwardly.\nIn the end, he decided to change his clothes and leave the house because he had to keep his promise!\n...\nSaturday morning, the sky was gray and misty. It made one feel inexplicably stifled.\nThis was a common scene in Backlund's deep winter. Although the smog wasn't as thick and pungent like last year, the geographical environment and climate characteristics had determined that such situations would definitely exist for a long period of time. Furthermore, victory over environmental pollution was never something that could be declared in a year or two.\nAfter putting on a black coat that covered her knees, and a black veil hat, Melissa quickly walked to the door.\nBenson held his hat and shook his head.\n\"A young girl who isn't even twenty years old should be dressed like a teenager. You look overly mature and old-fashioned in that, understand? Old-fashioned.\"\nMelissa glanced at her brother and simply replied, \"The price of a pound of bread has risen by a quarter-pence.\"\n\"This price...\" Benson tsked.\nHe then took out a silver pocket watch covered in vine-leaf patterns and snapped it open.\n\"Let's go. There's still a long way to go to the municipal square.\"\nMelissa tersely responded and went out into the streets with her brother.\n\"Good morning, Mrs. Daniel.\" After taking a few steps forward, Benson saw a neighbor leaving. He greeted her with a smile.\nHe was good at chatting and had long established a good relationship with his neighbors.\nThe lady named Mrs. Daniel wore a pure black dress. She was in her forties and had a thin face. Her face was covered in a thin black veil that hung down from her hat. When she heard the greeting, she nodded and replied simply, \"Good morning, the two of you.\"\nShe didn't make any small talk, and she coldly walked away.\nAs he watched her back, Benson deliberately slowed down his pace. When they finally opened up a distance, he turned to ask his sister, \"What happened to Mrs. Daniel?\n\"I've been too busy recently, so I haven't visited the neighbors in a long time.\"\nMelissa pursed her lips and said, \"Mrs. Daniel's eldest son was confirmed to have died on the front line at the Amantha mountain range. News from yesterday.\"\n\"That tall, bashful, but thoughtful, kind, and sincere young lad? When he came back the last time, he said that he was promoted in the army and became an officer...\" Benson asked in surprise.\nMelissa nodded.\n\"I couldn't imagine that Larry would die just like that...\"\nJust like how she couldn't imagine the tragic deaths of her classmates at school.\nIn just a few seconds, some people could no longer speak, communicate, or study.\nBenson was silent for a moment before sighing.\n\"I've been busy lately. Actually, I've been dealing with bereavement payments, but perhaps the list I received didn't include Larry, so I'm not sure.\n\"There's a lot of information on that list. Some are cheerful, others are humorous, others are the only child within a family. Some are determined, while others are the leaders of the soldiers around them. Some just got married and don't have children. Some are preparing presents for their youngest daughter, while others had love letters with them. They planned on sending it at the post office after the battle... But, they're all dead.\"\nMelissa and Benson fell silent at the same time, and neither of them spoke for a long time.\nWhen they were almost at the intersection, Melissa looked at the road ahead and said in a low voice, \"What do you think His Majesty will be talking about in his speech today?\"\n\"Perhaps it's a form of musters, or perhaps it's to convey the faith that we will prevail,\" Benson said in passing.\nMelissa turned to look at her brother.\n\"This isn't like you, Benson. Shouldn't you be making some snarky remarks?\"\n\"It should wait till the speech is heard and the specific content is understood. The most basic principle of being a person is to not make comment on things that one doesn't know enough of. Otherwise, they would be worse than a curly-haired baboon,\" Benson said with a smile.\nAt this moment, he saw another neighbor.\nThe other party's hair was white, and his face was half-covered with a scarf. He was wearing a thick jacket and was holding a cloth bag in his hand as he hurried past the siblings.\n\"Mr. Thomas's dressing is so strange... Does he still need to do something else?\" Benson looked at the back of the man and asked in puzzlement.\nMelissa replied in a low voice, \"Mrs. Thomas is sick, and that spent quite a bit of their family's savings. Recently, with food prices sharply increasing while Mr. Thomas's income remains the same, he has to queue up at the soup kitchen every few days to get some bread. He's a decent gentleman, so he probably doesn't want others to recognize him.\n\"Also, the food at the soup kitchen is always limited. If one's late, there might not be any left. They'll have to go to the cathedral, the workhouse, and other places. The handouts just happen to start after His Majesty's speech, so Mr. Thomas probably wants to go there directly.\"\nBenson nodded slowly and asked in concern, \"What's wrong with Mrs. Thomas? I know a few good doctors.\"\n\"A disease caused by anxiety,\" Melissa explained what she had heard. \"Mrs. Thomas is very worried about her youngest child who's serving in the army.\"\n\"You mean Thomas Jr.?\" Benson frowned slightly.\nAfter receiving his sister's confirmation, he fell silent, as if recalling something.\nAfter a while, when they approached the nearest municipal square, Benson looked ahead and whispered, \"Thomas Jr. is already dead...\"\n\"...\" Melissa didn't respond, but her expression was a little dazed.\nThey walked forward silently, as if they were relying on inertia.\nMore and more people appeared in front of them. These people were either dressed in formal attire or holding canes, dressed up as gentlemen. Otherwise, they were dressed in blue, green, yellow, and red-colored skirts; sweaters and leather jackets matched with pants; or dark-colored petticoats. Their colors were dull.\nThey came out of their houses and from the streets they were on, like water droplets splashing upward. They merged together at the intersection, forming a tiny stream.\nThe stream surged ahead, combining with other tributaries, and flowed into the square's entrance, interweaving into a majestic torrent.\nThe torrents slowly surged forward, flooding the square.\nAmidst this torrent of humans, Melissa felt like she was as puny as a water droplet."}
{"num_chp":968,"summary":"The cloth doll turned its lifeless eyes before its body stood up straight. It looked towards the area that the crimson moonlight failed to illuminate. There, the man with the lumpy cheek and the other cultists had been standing quietly, but at this moment, they bowed their heads, raising their arms as though they were praying, piously listening to the \"revelation.\"\nAbout two to three seconds later, the cloth doll finally stood up straight. Just as it was about to open its tongueless mouth and produce a voice that didn't belong to the \"body\" it was in, all its movements suddenly turned sluggish, as though it was a highly-rusted robot.\nHidden amongst the cultists, Klein had seen a strange spirituality thread extend from the cloth doll. Without any hesitation, he began controlling it!\nInside the wall lamp-illuminated room, the lights dimmed instantly. The doll with curved eyes and mouth instantly lost the support that seemed to arise from having a skeleton before slumping to the table, motionless.\nAmidst the flickering street lights that were more than a thousand meters away, Klein lost control over the blob of Spirit Body Threads. The power that descended with the help of the doll took less than two seconds to escape out of his range!\nWhoosh!\nA biting-cold wind swept up inside the room as the rug with tables and chairs above was suddenly tugged, sending the man with the lumpy cheek and most of the other cultists tumbling. Only the disguised Klein had jumped up in time to avoid the accident.\nOf course, Winner Enzo stood perfectly fine at the border of the rug, completely unaffected.\nWhoosh!\nAmidst the cold wind, the rug rolled up and bound the few cultists and covered their noses and mouth tightly, gripping their throats.\nMeanwhile, the fountain pens on the table had their caps removed autonomously before shooting forward, stabbing into the neck of the man with the lumpy cheek. They left no gaps in the dense array of pens.\nA wooden chair exploded as its splinters swept over without sparing any of the remaining cultists.\nNear the wall, the pipe of a wall lamp cracked, causing the gas inside to whistle out.\nThe cloth that draped the sofa rose up, tied itself into a robe, and wrapped around the train conductor's throat. A few of the floor tiles flew up, stabbing a few cultists from below.\nInstantly, all the items in the room were filled with offensive capability as though they were attempting to kill all signs of life inside.\nKlein tried to dodge, but his shirt, pants, belt, coat, and hat seemed to have a life of their own. They forcefully locked him down on the spot.\nHe hurriedly opened his mouth and let out a sound: \"Pa!\"\nHe had mimicked the sound of snapping fingers.\nScarlet flames surged out from his clothes, instantly blanketing his body and removing the restraints\nAt this moment, the cloth on another sofa rose up as though it was draped over someone.\nThis strange scene reflected in Klein's eyes immediately as he trembled and turned stiff. He had been possessed by an evil spirit!\nThe flames that soared up from before hadn't extinguished. They were burning away his clothes and flesh, only to reduce him to a pitch-black paper figurine.\nBehind this paper figurine was a pattern covered with feathers. It was a surreal and illusory feeling.\nThis was the mutated paper figurine that had been tainted with Artificial Death's aura!\nKlein knew that there were only two situations that were possible for the doll to mutate. One was that the entity disguising as a god was nearby and had sensed the deaths of the cultists; hence, preparations were made via a deliberate descent, laying a trap for the antagonist. Another was that the one using the doll was indeed some secret existence. \"He\" wasn't aware that the sacrificial ritual had been foiled and descended at the predetermined time to give the next round of \"revelations.\"\nAnd regardless of which situation it was, it meant danger. Therefore, how could Klein perform unprepared?\nBased on the characteristics of a descent or the possession of the doll, he had already placed the paper figurine, which had mutated because of the corruption of Artificial Death's aura, in the iron cigar case. He had also maintained the level of his marionette at the level of an ordinary person in order to lure the target into possessing him!\nAt this point, the possession target of the \"god\" that the cultists worshiped had gone from Klein to the Death Paper Figurine! As the scarlet flames swept about, the pitch-black paper figurine ignited as a pale-white color spread abruptly, tinged with a slightly dark green color.\nA rather painful grunt sounded as a transparent afterimage flashed across a window tinted with the crimson moonlight.\nAlmost at the same instant, the items that came \"alive\" inside the room fell to the ground, returning to their lifeless state. As for Enzo, flames were swirling around him.\nAt this moment, in the port city north of the Southern Continent, the residents were enjoying the comfort and warmth of their home and family at night. They didn't notice that their glass windows and the surfaces of the wall lamps would dim before quickly returning to normal.\nAlongside this dimming environment, the flames in the fireplace either intensified or dwindled. The remnants in the kitchen were ignited and snuffed out.\nDuring this process, the glass windows in that room dimmed the most, and the fluctuations in the flames kept happening. However, the believers in the room were praying to the Primordial Moon, paying no notice to what was happening.\nAfter an unknown period of time, the crimson moonlight brightened a little, as though covering the entire city in a light veil.\nSuch brightness quickly returned to normal as a scarlet red flame flared up on a silver candle on a dining table.\nEnzo walked out of it as his body and face rapidly changed into Gehrman Sparrow.\nJust moments ago, at the instant when the crimson moon brightened, he had lost his target.\nNot only possessing the Beyonder powers of a High-Sequence Beyonder of the Wraith pathway, but they can also borrow the power of the crimson moon... Regarding these two aspects, one of them is only possible with a Sealed Artifact or mystical item... Klein muttered silently and came to a preliminary judgment.\nAfter the demigod who possessed the doll had been corrupted by the Death Paper Figurine, he had believed that he had the chance to take his opponent down. To his surprise, the enemy's strength and means available to them were more varied and potent than he imagined.\nThe only thing he could confirm was that it wasn't an angel, as the strength and level were far inferior to one.\nJust as this thought flashed through his mind, Klein left the dining room and entered the activity room. There were a few believers praying to the Primordial Moon.\nUnlike the cultists on the steam locomotive, they knew who they were praying to, as though they were more formal members of the parish.\nOne step. Two steps. Three steps. Klein entered the room in an unhurried pace before they turned their heads when they noticed him.\nWith the powerful illusion power of a Bizarro Sorcerer, they treated Gehrman Sparrow as an oracle that had descended upon them. They saw a bright moon halo at his head.\nThe believers plopped to their knees in devout prostration.\nKlein didn't beat about the bush as he asked in a deep voice, \"Who was the saint you met previously?\"\nAlthough one of the believers was puzzled, he still respectfully answered, \"Oracle, it was Shaman King Klarman.\"\nShaman King Klarman... That's a familiar name... Ah right, the author of that Book of Secrets... Isn't he long dead? He was alive in a time over a millennium ago. Saints of non-special pathways have no way of living that long... He joined the Rose School of Thought but still believes in the Primordial Moon. Through some means, he has extended his life? Or could it be that his Sequence alone affords him a long life? Klein's mind whirred and recalled the origins of the name \"Klarman.\"\nA sailboat was docked by the pier as the faint moonlight illuminated the cabin's interior.\nA figure with frizzled black hair with white streaks in them walked out of a mirror. He wore a back robe with crimson patterns. He had wrinkles that were neither too deep or shallow on his face. His eyes were bloodshot.\nAt this moment, on the skin he exposed, such as the back of his hand, his pores had expanded, producing white feathers that were stained with pale yellow oil.\nThis elder's expression was somewhat warped as if he was enduring pain.\nHe quickly sat on the bedside, bowed his head, clasped his hands, and silently chanted.\nIn his jarring voice, his forehead slowly cracked apart, revealing a red full moon that seemed to be embedded in it!\nThe moonlight dispersed and cloaked the elder, causing the white feathers on him to contract and recede into nothingness.\nBut at this moment, his abdomen bloated up as though it was filled with liquid.\nFinally, his clothes, together with his skin, tore apart as a blob of flesh and blood covered in white feathers flew out onto the deck. After squirming for quite a while, it rotted and died.\nPhew... The elder looked up and slowly exhaled. His bloodshot eyes were filled with puzzlement.\nHe muttered softly, \"Death's Blessed?\n\"But Death is no more...\"\nEarly in the morning, the Church of Storms's Mandated Punishers, who had taken over the case of the mysterious deaths of the steam locomotive's staff, had received new intelligence.\nThe missing conductor and driver, as well as a few suspicious passengers, had been found!\nBefore long, this Mandated Punisher team followed the clues and found their targets.\nThey were silently hung outside a building in a row.\n\"This is a provocation!\" The Mandated Punisher's captain growled through clenched teeth.\nBut after they lowered the corpses and carried out their investigations inside the room, they saw that these people had been piously praying to the Primordial Moon in the activity room, holding a rather diabolical ritual.\n\"...Apprehend all of them!\" The Mandated Punisher captain issued a command after a second of surprise.\nThe believers of the Primordial Moon seemed to regain their reason as they tried to resist. However, they were quickly suppressed, either dying or being injured in the process.\nThe Mandated Punisher captain surveyed the area and inexplicably said to his peers, \"They didn't notice the row of corpses hanging at their doorstep?\"\nA member of the Reader pathway thought and said, \"Those corpses might've been left there to guide us to investigate the area.\"\nThe Mandated Punisher captain calmed himself down and nodded in thought, \"Which Church's demigod passed by?\""}
{"num_chp":436,"summary":"Seeing the white foam of the Southville beer being placed in front of Sherlock Moriarty, Carlson finally came to his senses.\nIt was only when the bartender was a certain distance away from them did he ask in a suppressed voice, \"What do you want?\"\nKlein picked up his glass and took a sip. He took a few seconds to savor the bitter taste of the malt and the faint sweetness from it.\n\"Cheers!\" He looked sideways at Carlson and smiled before raising his glass.\nWithout hesitation, Carlson shook his head and refused the offer, mumbling, \"You have beer, while I have strong distilled liquor. It's not suitable for a toast.\"\nKlein was only going through the motions, so he once again took a sip of his Southville beer, looked straight ahead, and chuckled.\n\"What I want is very simple.\n\"I'm not sure what's inside the tomb, so I can only describe it rather vaguely... Well, I hope that I can choose an item from the spoils of your tomb exploration. I'm not greedy, and my request will not involve high Sequence items. I wouldn't dare to take it even if they were one of the options.\n\"If you find nothing or there are only high Sequence items, then I don't want anything. Of course, I believe that when the latter happens, you wouldn't be stingy with giving me a sum of cash that's consistent with my contribution.\"\nAfter hearing about the Amon family's tomb from Miss Sharron yesterday, he had came up with rough plans.\nThe first plan was to blow the copper whistle, contact Mr. Azik, and join forces to explore the tomb.\nHowever, there were many potential problems with this plan. Firstly, he was unsure of the amount of strength Azik, who was still in the midst of finding his lost memories, had regained. Secondly, Azik was being pursued by MI9, so it was very easy for him and Azik to land in trouble. Thirdly, there was a high chance that Klein would end up reappearing in the sights of Sealed Artifact 0-08 once again. Of course, he could also consider using the help of the gray fog to make contact or embark on the expedition. However, blowing the copper whistle above the gray fog made it impossible to summon the messenger; therefore, ending all of his subsequent plans.\nMore importantly, Klein didn't dare to reveal the secret of the space above the fog to Azik Eggers whose identity remained a mystery.\nTherefore, he finally chose the second method, which was to use his identity as an informant to submit the information to the Machinery Hivemind and ask for a reasonable reward.\nWhen it came to the number of High-Sequence Beyonders, which faction could have more than the seven Churches?\nAccording to what Klein knew, there were close to ten High-Sequence Beyonders in the Church of the Evernight Goddess. In other words, nearly half of the thirteen archbishops and nine high-ranking deacons had reached or surpassed Sequence 4. This wasn't considering the adorer of the Goddess, the Pope who helmed the Church.\nEven if the situation regarding the Church of the God of Steam and Machinery was inferior in this aspect, it couldn't be that inferior. Their archbishop of the Backlund diocese, Horamick Haydn, was a High-Sequence Beyonder.\nAnd as such, for an orthodox church, with all its resources accumulated to date, it wouldn't value the Mid-Sequence items very, very, very much. Klein believed that he could negotiate a reasonable \"price.\"\nSimply put, the core element of the second plan was: find an organization for any difficulties!\nUpon hearing Klein's offer, Carlson paused for a second, then blurted out, \"Aren't you a believer in God?\"\nI've always had the Goddess in my heart...Klein drew a triangular Sacred Emblem on his chest.\n\"It is because of my belief in God that I've told you this information, not to the Nighthawks through Mr. Stanton.\n\"God said to let those who wish to be strong, be strong. Only by becoming stronger and having more money can I have more access to different channels and resources, and thus provide you with better and more effective information.\"\nIn order to convince the Machinery Hivemind, he had specifically spent the morning reading through the \"Steam and Machinery Bible\" that he had bought earlier. He then found a few sentences from the deity that met his requirements and memorized them.\nCarlson was momentarily unable to provide a rejoinder. He just sat there, stunned, to the point of forgetting to drink.\nSeeing this, Klein quickly added, \"Moreover, this will help you establish a harmonious and efficient relationship with new-generation informants. As long as you spread the news of the rewards I receive as a result of this, as well as keeping your promise without going back on your word, then I believe that the other informants will be deeply moved and be greatly motivated to do their best to gather useful information for you.\n\"Of course, I wish that you use my pseudonym when advertising this.\"\nCarlson listened with a blank face, picked up his glass, and gulped down a mouthful. He almost choked.\n\"Cough. Sherlock, the real you is completely different from what I remember about you from before.\" He sighed.\nThe Detective Sherlock Moriarty in his memories was good at analysis and reasoning, he was extremely calm and polite, and, with a great sense of justice, had offered very effective advice. He was an outstanding believer in God.\nYet now, he was...\nKlein took a sip of his beer and chuckled.\n\"Everyone has their different sides. Using a single facade to face everything is prone to error. This is a problem you have to pay attention to when making deductions.\"\nAfter calming down for a moment, Carlson stood up and said, \"I have no right to agree to such a request. I will report it immediately, so wait here for a while.\"\n\"Alright.\" Klein waved to the bartender and added a serving of potato wedges.\nBy the time he leisurely finished his food and beer, Carlson returned to the bar with the deacon of the Machinery Hivemind, Ikanser Bernard.\nIkanser looked around, and seeing that there was no one around, he said in a deep voice, \"There's no problem with your request, but there's one condition to add on-items with strong side effects and curses are not among the items available for selection.\"\nWhat I want is an ingredient...Klein immediately laughed.\n\"Alright!\n\"Dare I ask again if is this your personal decision or the response from the higher-ups?\"\n\"I have the right to make such a decision.\" Ikanser used his hat to press down on his fluffy hair. \"But since it concerns an aristocratic tomb from the Fourth Epoch, I had sent a telegram to the archbishop, and he didn't object to it in his reply.\"\n\"Alright.\" Klein drew another triangular Sacred Emblem on his chest. \"I'll give you the information now.\"\nIkanser shook his head subconsciously.\nHe looked around and pointed to a billiard room.\n\"Let's talk inside.\"\nThis deacon, who is always publicly placed on trial by the mirror called Arrodes, is quite experienced...Klein murmured and followed Ikanser and Carlson into the billiard room while making sure that the adjacent rooms were empty.\nKlein paused for a few seconds and said with some deliberation, \"The thing is, there was a Beyonder who found a hidden tomb at the mouth of the Stratford River in White Cliff Town. He searched the periphery and found some items.\n\"After that, they recruited people and did further explorations, but no one returned. If you search carefully over there, you will definitely find the corresponding traces.\"\nAfter listening carefully, Ikanser asked, \"Are you sure it's an aristocratic tomb from the Fourth Epoch?\"\n\"The items on the outside can prove that they're members of the Tudor Dynasty's Amon family,\" Klein answered truthfully. He then warned him, \"The Beyonders who died in there weren't weak at all, and there were quite a few of them. I believe that this tomb isn't something that can be explored by those below High-Sequence Beyonders.\"\n\"Amon...\" Ikanser frowned instinctively.\nIt could be seen that, as a deacon, he had the authority to know some ancient secret history.\nWithout waiting for Klein to emphasize it again, he looked up and said, \"We will collect the relevant information first before we act.\"\n\"A Fourth Epoch aristocratic tomb is very dangerous. Don't tell this information to anyone else, or explore it yourself. Otherwise, you and your friends will only lose their lives.\"\nIf I dared, I wouldn't be sitting here...Klein gave a self-deprecating laugh and said, \"My reputation has always been good.\"\nAfter making the deal, he watched Ikanser and Carlson leave before putting on his hat and sauntering out of Lucky Bar.\nTowards the nobles of the Fourth Epoch, as well as the Amon family, the Machinery Hivemind will still be very cautious. They'll have to have at least several days of preparing before they take action... Prudence...Klein's random thoughts froze on a single word.\nHe thought of another thing that could be described as being prudent.\nAfter Roselle had joined the ancient organization suspected of being the Twilight Hermit Order, he had actually never mentioned its name in his own secret diary which was written in Chinese. Each time, he would refer to it by referring to it with the appropriate characteristics.\nThis level of prudence was a very suspicious phenomenon!\nWhy didn't Emperor Roselle dare to mention the name of that organization, even when it's written in Chinese? This is completely different from the style of writing where he dared to write anything in his diary... What was he afraid of, or what was he worried about? Could it be that as long as he said or wrote down the name of the Twilight Hermit Order, then they would be made aware of it it no matter which language he used? Does one of their members or a Sealed Artifact they possess have such abilities?A guess popped up in Klein's mind, but there was no way to confirm it unless he was willing to take the risk.\nI'll first assume it's true and that I haven't been perceived by them, because the channeling of the Desire Apostle's spirit had been done above the gray fog. Informing Miss Justice of it was also done in response to a prayer using the gray fog... Well, it's almost Monday, and I have to remind Miss Justice at the Tarot Club not to say or write down the name \"Twilight Hermit Order.\" As for the reason, she can understand it by herself with me simply giving her a look...Klein quickly made his next arrangements and strode out of Lucky Bar.\nSeeing that it was still early, he took a horse carriage to the Quelaag Club, intending to spend the afternoon there.\nAs soon as he entered the hall, he saw the equestrian teacher, Talim Dumont.\nThis descendant of blue-blood was seated in a corner, holding a glass of scarlet grape wine. His face was rosy, and he was sipping it in high spirits.\n\"You seem to be in a good mood, Talim,\" Klein smiled and greeted him.\nTalim chuckled and said, \"Because the new year is coming.\"\nThen, rather excitedly, he asked, \"Sherlock, do you know what it's like to really like someone?\"\n\"...\" Klein showed a fake smile.\n\"I'm sorry, I'm still single.\"\nTalim finished the rest of his wine, stood up, waved his hand, and said, \"That's a pity. Well, I have to get busy.\"\n\"By the way, thank you for introducing Mr. Framis Cage,\" Klein recalled the investment of the bike project and sincerely expressed his gratitude. \"When are you free these days? I'd like to get you to bring me around to sample some of Backlund's delicacies.\"\n\"After the new year.\" Talim put on his hat and walked with a smile to the reception hall.\nHas this fellow entered the season of love?Klein couldn't help but mutter.\nJust as he turned around and took a few steps, he suddenly heard a heavy thud.\nKlein jerked his head back and saw Talim Dumont on the ground, his left hand clamped tightly at his chest where his heart was. His body was convulsing nonstop.\nThis...Klein hurried over.\nBut at this moment, Talim had already spat out all of the white foam on his mouth, losing his last breath of life.\nIn just a few seconds, he had turned into a dead corpse."}
{"num_chp":536,"summary":"What? Hunt Admiral of Blood?Danitz almost raised his right hand to his ear.\nHis first reaction was that he had misheard.\nHowever, Gehrman Sparrow's smile with hidden madness and the slight movement of his captain's eyebrows-an abnormality of hers-reminded him that what was said had really happened!\nThis... This madman Gehrman Sparrow really is daring! This is one of the seven Pirate Admirals. They aren't people that a character like Steel Maveti can be compared with!Danitz's pupils shrank, his heart on the brink of roaring.\nPutting aside the fact that Admiral of Blood Senor's own might, just the pirates underneath him are intimidating enough. His first mate, third mate, and the captains of each ship are all capable of independently leading a large pirate crew!\nThere are still many of the crew which Steel Maveti had brought to Bayam with him in the Blood pirate crew!\nWhen Vice Admiral Hurricane Qilangos died silently like a wild dog in Backlund, it was mainly because he wasn't with his pirate crew. However, Admiral of Blood Senor is different. He seldom leaves his flagship and rarely leaves the company of his men.\nEven if the focus is placed back on Senor's strength, it would still be extremely terrifying. He's mysterious, bizarre, and is one of the few powerhouses at the sea who is second only to the Four Kings. Even Captain might not dare to claim to be his superior... A madman's guts really does exceed my imagination. No, he doesn't know the meaning of fear at all! The death and replacement of a pirate admiral will definitely be a great shock to the Five Seas!One thought after another flashed through Danitz's mind, but in the end, he strangely calmed down.\nIt was because he recalled that Gehrman Sparrow was a powerhouse at the level of the seven admirals, and there might be a hidden, terrifying organization backing him.\nEdwina said after a few seconds of silence, \"Do you know of the Rose School of Thought?\"\nNot only do I know them, I've also killed their people and taken their mystical items... Wait a minute, why do I have to describe myself as a bad guy...Klein converged his smile and said in an unperturbed manner, \"I've hunted their members.\"\nEdwina fell silent again. Next to her, Danitz once again had various thoughts:\"What are they talking about? What's the Rose School of Thought? Where am I? Whose dream is this?\"\nAfter a short moment of silence, Edwina said, \"After the huge battle with Vice Admiral Dusk's pirate crew, Senor's crew vanished. At present, no one knows where they are. One will have to wait patiently.\"\nIs this an agreement?Klein once again revealed a smile.\n\"I do not lack patience.\n\"How can I contact you?\"\nEdwina turned her head to look at Danitz.\n\"He knows how.\"\nMe? Soulfall Ritual? Wait a minute, Captain, you mean I have to follow this madman, Gehrman Sparrow, during this period of time? No! Who knows when this fellow will go crazy!With a start, Danitz quickly opened his mouth and said, \"Captain, I've already left the Golden Dream for too long. I've missed too many lessons! I can't wait to return!\"\nHe tried his hardest to show his sincerity in his eyes, filling them with the desire for knowledge.\n\"I believe we can switch to someone else, like Iron Skin and Barrel...\"\nBefore he finished his sentence, Edwina suddenly raised her right hand and pressed it against her ear.\nShe looked slightly to the side and said without expression, \"What did you say?\n\"I couldn't hear it.\n\"Roselle's Dream Spell is reaching its limits...\"\nThe pirate admiral's skirt fluttered slightly as she took a step back before her figure quickly turned faint, reducing into points of fragmented light.\nThe rest of Danitz's words were left stuck in his throat. He stretched out his right hand in an attempt to grasp something, but he ended up weakly drooping down.\nRoselle's Dream Spell? The Emperor's presence in the field of mysticism is also quite formidable... The full name of the Vice Admiral Iceberg is Edwina Edwards... Edwards. Isn't this the surname of one of the emperor's Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse? A descendant? However, from the tone of Vice Admiral Iceberg, she isn't familiar with the eldest daughter of the emperor, Bernadette. They might not even know each other...Klein looked at Danitz, whose expression had completely collapsed, and let out a soft laugh.\n\"Perhaps one day I will call you Mr. 10,000 Pounds.\"\n\"...\"\nDanitz straightened his back in fright, then he saw Gehrman Sparrow's figure disappear from his dream.\nIf I were only Sequence 7 and had a bounty of seven or eight thousand pounds, then I would be targeted everywhere I go...Danitz stood rooted in his dream, his head hurting the more he thought about it.\n...\nIn the evening, Danitz looked at Gehrman Sparrow, who was dressed as a native.\n\"Today, we'll be visiting the location faction. We might be able to find some good things there. Heh heh, they have a great need for Beyonder ingredients, food, and weapons.\"\nAt this point, Danitz looked Gehrman Sparrow up and down. It was rare for him to find something that he was better than him at. He said with a smile, \"Their area is filled with local people. There aren't even many people with mixed blood. If there's even the slightest signs of an abnormality in their clothing, you will be discovered.\n\"Your pantaloons and brown jacket are fine, but you can't wear a shirt inside. A real native wears Taraba shirts; they're similar to Sea Soul shirts, but they're either all blue or white. They don't wear caps, headscarves, or anything.\n\"Also, people like you who look obviously Loenese will encounter very serious discrimination and hostility there, just like a wolf that sneaks into a flock of sheep. You can't hide your existence at all...\"\nBefore he could finish, he saw Gehrman Sparrow tilt his head and look at him. His deep facial features quickly turned soft. His fair skin was instantly stained with the color of bronze. In just a snap, he had become an undeniable native that didn't stand out in any way.\n\"...\"\nAfter a few seconds of silence, Danitz laughed dryly as if nothing had happened. \"Me too. I have to disguise myself.\"\nYour disguise? Heh...Klein took off his cap and sat down.\n\"What local faction?\"\nIt actually trades Beyonder ingredients, food, and weapons?\n\"Ahem, to put it simply, ahem- The Resistance.\" Danitz suddenly wasn't sure if Gehrman Sparrow had any connections with the Loen officials.\nKlein was startled for a second.\n\"Resistance?\"\nDanitz smiled awkwardly and said, \"People who clamor for independence and for natives to administer their local affairs. Their encampment is deep in the woods or at sea. They cooperate with many pirates and adventurers. Of course, the ones backing them are mainly people from Feysac and Intis. Often, there will be priests from the God of Combat and the Eternal Blazing Sun secretly coming over.\"\nBayam isn't that calm after all...After leaving the kingdom and coming to the sea, Klein finally understood what it meant by an international situation. This wasn't something that could be compared to reading about wars in East Balam from the papers.\nHe nodded slightly and didn't object to visiting the local faction.\nAfter leaving the Wind of Azure Inn, Klein followed Danitz, whose face was painted black. They went through the streets, heading all the way southeast.\nLeaving the confines of the City of Generosity, they entered a zone filled with different architectural styles. The buildings here had raised floors, propped up by wooden pilings. There were three- or four-story buildings that had evolved from the Loen-styled terrace houses.\nThe roads that split from each other were narrow and dirty, with many stalls on either side. They sold all kinds of headgear, earrings, and accessories made of stone. They were mostly bright red or multicolored.\n\"What a bunch of strange fellows. They especially like bright colors, just like those venomous snakes in the forest,\" Danitz whispered.\nAs someone from Intis, you aren't much better either. You advocate the color of gold, and advocate a sense of luxury and exquisiteness, just like a nouveau riche...Klein lampooned.\nThey passed by a group of dark-skinned, skinny, and shriveled natives, entering the alleys which had clothes drying over their heads. The scene before their eyes suddenly opened up, revealing a small municipal square.\nOn the square, a group of locals was gathered around the central pond. Some were kneeling, some were prostrating, some were mumbling, and some were singing softly. They had devout expressions, but they looked numbed.\nAs soon as they realized that someone was approaching, they quickly got up and ran into the surrounding alleys in a flurry.\nAll the windows on the second, third, and fourth floors of the surrounding houses clanged shut, and the square grew quiet, but Klein's spiritual perception told him that there were many people behind the windows, around the alleys, in the dark corners, watching these strangers who had suddenly arrived in their world.\nDanitz lowered his head and said in a suppressed voice, \"Don't worry, this is their way of protecting themselves.\"\n\"Oh?\" Klein expressed his doubts.\nDanitz let out a chuckle.\n\"Before this place was completely colonized, the natives on the Rorsted Archipelago always believed in Sea God Kalvetua. They believed that this deity who appears in the form of a gigantic sea serpent would protect all the islands here, preventing them from being devoured by earthquakes or tsunamis.\n\"Now that this belief has been outlawed, the Church of the Lord of Storms has been constantly fighting against the heretics. Even the Church of Evernight and the Church of Steam and Machinery are unable to expand their influence here, and there are only a few cathedrals.\n\"But in fact, how can the faith that has been in place for centuries, if not a millennium, be so easily eradicated? There are still plenty of believers of the Sea God in Bayam, Blue Mountain Island, and the Rorsted Sea. Even if a bunch of people are captured every one to two months, a situation in which they suffer all kinds of extreme punishment, it's impossible to reverse this situation any time soon. The Resistance's main pillar of support are the believers of the Sea God.\n\"In my opinion, it will take at least another hundred years before the faith of the Sea God will be completely eradicated. Of course, that's under the premise that there aren't any other disruptive elements.\"\nSea God Kalvetua... Its image is of a gigantic sea serpent...As Klein listened thoughtfully, he followed Danitz into a four-story house on the right. He went to the top floor via a narrow staircase.\nKnock! Knock! Knock!Danitz knocked on the door to his left.\n\"Who is it?\" someone asked in a low voice.\nDanitz replied with a chuckle, \"A friend who brings wine and barbecue.\"\n\"Where from?\" the person inside asked a strange question.\nDanitz stepped back.\n\"At sea.\"\nCreak.The door slowly opened and Klein saw a naked arm.\nThe arm was tattooed with a blue, hideous sea serpent."}
{"num_chp":823,"summary":"As the captain of the Future, Cattleya knew of the latent dangers that Frank Lee had better than anyone else. She knew that this first mate's strange ideas would at times be about truly terrifying and crazy developments. If it wasn't because those \"creations\" had yet to be proliferated and lacked the necessary elements, Cattleya believed that the world would be different.\nOf course, if there came such a day, she would finish off Frank Lee ahead of everyone else by feeding him to the fishes!\nWith him lacking godhood, many things will be limited in scope even if they're considered a success. It's impossible to distribute out and bring about a greater disaster... Just advancing to Sequence 5 wouldn't result in any qualitative changes, and Frank has been holding back greatly in recent times. He's been focused on researching plants that can survive and grow through the absorption of monster corpses in the darkness...As her thoughts swirled and changed in her mind, Cattleya finally made a decision.\n\"How much do you wish to get for it?\"\nShe had a vague feeling that The World Gehrman Sparrow was recently in need of money.\n\"8000 pounds. If you can replace it with large sums of gold coins, you'll receive a discount.\" Klein secretly heaved a sigh of relief as he answered using The World.\nAt the thought of how Frank Lee could be able to afford this sum, and how he wouldn't reject a Druid's Beyonder characteristic, Cattleya pondered for two seconds and said, \"Deal. Give me a week to gather the amount.\"\n\"No problem.\" Klein got The World Gehrman Sparrow to retract his gaze.\nAfter the trip to the primitive island, if not for having garnered the attention of the existence hidden in the depths of the cathedral, he would've given himself a perfect score. In less than half a night, he had obtained an invaluable Card of Blasphemy, a mystical item with not less than 10,000 pounds, as well as a possible total of 16,000 pounds. Furthermore, no taxes needed to be paid. It was faster than robbing a bank!\nUnfortunately, that primitive island has vanished. Otherwise, I can always pay a visit when I'm lacking money...Klein's thoughts wandered as he watched Miss Justice look at Mr. Hanged Man and ask with a tone of anticipation, \"Do you have the fruits of the Illusory Chime Tree?\"\nAudrey actually had some inkling to the answer. This was because Mr. World had obtained so many Sequence 5 Beyonder characteristics recently, and Mr. Hanged Man was suspected to have had a private partnership with him in the past week. It was unlikely that he had obtained nothing.\nI can figure out certain clues from Mr. Hanged Man's satisfied and confident state...Audrey felt increasingly confident in her ability to observe others.\nAlger chuckled and said, \"I was just about to tell you that I've already obtained the fruit.\"\nExcellent!Audrey held back and didn't act overly agitated.\nThis meant that she had gathered all the ingredients for Hypnotist. All she needed to do was wait for her Psychiatrist potion to completely digest before she attempted the advancement.\nAnd it wouldn't take too long!Having already become an \"Aunt Agony\" in the aristocrat circles in East Chester County, Audrey thought with great certainty.\nTo be frank, if she hadn't deliberately guided the topic of conversation, Audrey wouldn't have imagined that the aristocrats that all looked beaming with decent demeanors suffered immense stress. They had pains that others would find impossible to imagine. The changes of the times and the trends of society made them worried about the futures of their families and self. Of course, this was also related to them not being powerful aristocrats, as well as the limited resources they held on hand.\nThese matters made Audrey truly understand the concept of a facade. She understood that faced with different targets, everyone wore a different facade.\nAfter concluding such situations, she had instantly digested a significant amount of her Psychiatrist potion as her progress clearly sped up.\nPerhaps, in two weeks, more or less. In short, before I return to Backlund, I should be able to become a Hypnotist...Audrey looked at Alger with bright eyes and asked, \"What do you want in exchange?\"\nHaving advanced to Sequence 5 recently, and having obtained the \"key\" to the door of demigods, as well as being about to possess a potent mystical item, Alger was lacking in money the most at the moment. Therefore, he said without any hesitation, \"2,000 pounds.\"\n\"Deal.\" Audrey agreed with relatively great ease.\nThis amount of money didn't need a reimbursement for she could easily afford it herself.\nAfter completing the transaction, Audrey couldn't help but heave a sigh of relief. She finally didn't feel like she was falling behind in the Tarot Club.\nDuring this period of time, she had watched Fors become a Sequence 7, and watched Mr. Hanged Man approach the level of a High-Sequence Beyonder. She also saw Mr. World finish off one Sequence 5 Beyonder after another, producing their corresponding Beyonder characteristics again and again. Yet, she remained as a Psychiatrist, a Sequence 7 Beyonder. She couldn't help but feel stressed as she became a little anxious. She relied solely on Placating herself, and Susie's counseling, to prevent any emotional problems from happening. Now, she had finally taken a step forward towards becoming Sequence 6!\nAs the delighted Audrey increasingly enjoyed the gathering, she heard Ma'am Hermit say to Mr. World, \"I can provide an answer to that drop of blood from the Mythical Creature.\"\n\"Do you wish for a private communication?\" The Fool Klein controlled The World Gehrman Sparrow with piqued interest as he asked.\nIf it's solely an exchange of information, I'll make a killing out of nothing!he thought with anticipation.\nCattleya looked around, and after a few seconds of thought, she shook her head and said, \"There's no need.\n\"I can only provide two forms of payment. One, a single glance at the Wheel of Fortune card. I believe you know what this Card of Blasphemy that was created by Emperor Roselle means. Two, it's to provide the means to regain a certain amount of strength during one's weak stages.\n\"Please pass this message to that Angel, and ask if \u2018He' is satisfied with such a payment.\"\nProvide the means to regain a certain amount of strength during one's weak stages? Queen Mystic has guessed that it's related to the Snake of Fate? That doesn't make sense. An Angel includes a Sequence 2 Soothsayer... Can't The Fool have an Angel from the Fate pathway serving \"Him\"?\nI've no idea if Will Auceptin knows the way to become the corresponding pathway's Sequence 0. If \"He\" is unaware, then taking one look at the Wheel of Fortune card would be an irresistible temptation. However, it's unlikely. \"He\" has lived for so long, and he's a Sequence 1 at that. It wouldn't be so terrible to the point of only now grasping the ritual to becoming a god...\nHeh heh, I wonder what Roselle looks like on the Wheel of Fortune card... It has a snake with the emperor's face and other animals?Klein casually thought as he deliberated and made the fake person, The World, say, \"Okay.\n\"If a transaction is ultimately made, you will need to pay an additional amount.\"\n\"What do you want?\" Cattleya asked cautiously.\nThe World Gehrman Sparrow said with a hoarse laugh, \"I want to meet Queen Mystic. Don't worry. The matter is very simple. There's just something that needs her help.\"\nAfter a moment of silence, Cattleya said, \"I can only try my best to facilitate it, but I can't give any guarantees.\"\nUpon hearing their conversation, Audrey suddenly found it surreal.\nHas the Tarot Club already matured to such a level?\nAside from Mr. Fool, from us only being able to exchange basic knowledge in mysticism and Sequence 9 potion formulas, it has developed into transactions involving Cards of Blasphemy and the blood of Mythical Creatures...\nIt hadn't even been a year!\nIt's like a dream... I've also matured significantly...As Audrey sighed, The Hermit Cattleya continued looking at The World Gehrman Sparrow and said, \"There's some news regarding the Marauder pathway mystical item you want.\"\nAs she spoke, she requested Mr. Fool's help to conjure an item that resembled a tweezer.\nThis tweezer was grayish-white in color, as though they were formed from two finger bones. Apart from that, it was relatively ordinary.\nCattleya introduced, \"It's called Broken Finger. It can enhance the stability and agility of your wrist and fingers. It allows you to easily steal items in the pockets of your target without being discovered. The negative effect is kleptomania when worn. It costs 500 pounds.\"\nIt corresponds to Sequence 9 Marauder? Hmm, there's a slight premium involved...Klein considered for a moment and said, \"Alright. Let's close the transaction as soon as possible.\"\nThis way, he could investigate the region dug up by Hazel in the sewers, so as to eliminate any hidden risks.\nAfter the conversation between the duo ended, Fors asked with the intention to express interest in a purchase so that she could use it when the need arose.\n\"I need a cursed item from an ancient wraith, as well as its remnant spirituality. Please help me take note.\"\nAfter she obtained a positive reply from the members, The Moon Emlyn sized up his surroundings and leaned back into his chair, and he said to The Sun Derrick, \"Does your City of Silver have the Beyonder characteristic that corresponds to Sequence 5 of the artificial vampires?\"\nHe didn't wish to call the fellows covered in puss as described by The Sun as Sanguine; therefore, he changed the way he phrased his question.\nFrom his point of view, since there were often mutated vampires appearing around the City of Silver, then obtaining one or two Sequence 5 Beyonder characteristics wasn't too difficult.\nFurthermore, they clearly lack the potion formula of this pathway as well as an Artisan. Their retention of these Beyonder characteristics depends only on luck. Time needs to pass to determine if they would corrupt the items surrounding them, transforming into Sealed Artifacts...Emlyn convinced himself that he was helping the City of Silver instead of asking for The Sun's help.\nDerrick was stunned as he answered in complete honesty, \"Yes.\n\"But Mr. Moon, do you wish to be covered in pus?\"\nAh...Emlyn's expression froze as he was momentarily unsure if The Sun was mocking him or warning him.\nUpon seeing this, Derrick hurriedly added, \"Many of them have serious levels of mental corruption, and without the potion formula, our City of Silver wouldn't waste the effort to cleanse such problems.\"\nIs that so... This will be troublesome...Emlyn nodded slightly and said, \"Got it.\"\nHe didn't involve himself in possible transactions, preparing to seek advice from the upper echelons of the Sanguine to figure out the matter regarding the mental corruption of Beyonder characteristics.\nWith the transaction segment coming to an end, the Tarot Club's members began their free exchange segment.\nAudrey looked straight at Gehrman Sparrow and said with some hesitation.\n\"I would like to know where the Mentor of Confusion characteristic came from? If it involves certain secrets, you can choose not to answer.\"\nShe was making the preparations to convince her father, Earl Hall. It was also to avoid any unnecessary troubles. After all, Beyonders from the Black Emperor pathway might have certain connections with the military and royal family.\nKlein secretly laughed as he made The World answer, \"It comes from a curly-haired baboon.\""}
{"num_chp":1344,"summary":"Seeing that there weren't any abnormalities in the town of marionettes, Klein began thinking about Miss Justice's encounter.\nIt wasn't Adam who set up an attack against Ariehogg, but Hermes who masterminded it?\nOtherwise, it wouldn't be possible for Adam to not descend. It would also be impossible for Ariehogg to escape so easily. \"He\" had to rely on the second City of Miracles to have some hope of doing so.\nIf Hermes was the mastermind, the development of this whole episode becomes logical... Hermes never thought of capturing or killing Ariehogg. \"He\" only hopes to learn some information from this ancient mind dragon. When Ariehogg said \"Adam isn't necessarily Adam,\" the operation came to a natural end.\nYes, from the looks of it, Hermes already had some doubts about Adam's true state. However, due to the limitations of \"His\" status, \"He\" has been unable to make Ariehogg appear on \"His\" own accord, so \"He\" used Miss Justice.\nAdam isn't necessarily Adam; Ariehogg isn't necessarily Ariehogg... This sentence is very interesting. The upper echelons of the Spectator pathway are more mysterious than Seers. Back then, Dragon of Imagination Ankewelt clearly occupied Sequence 0, but \"He\" had a Sequence 1 son of the same pathway as \"Him\"-Dragon of Nightmare, Alzuhod...\nIf Adam really isn't Adam, then who is \"He\"? Is it that Adam from the myth in the time before the First Epoch, or part of the Primordial One? Or is \"He\" related to the resurrection of the ancient sun god? From the looks of it, the meaning behind why Medici addresses \"Him\" as a zealot has a far more profound meaning...\nKlein quickly conjured a gold coin and flicked it into the air, making a divination.\nThe results of the divination indicated that today's development was nothing dangerous.\nKlein immediately dispersed the gold coin and prepared to descend his consciousness into his body beneath Saint Arianna Cathedral.\nAt this moment, his actions became slightly sluggish.\nThe moment Miss Justice met Ariehogg and Hermes was almost simultaneous as the moment the MI9 personnel returned to Utopia to testify in court.\nJust looking at them individually, there was no problem; but the word \"simultaneous\" made Klein somewhat alert.\nHe was very sensitive to words like \"happened to,\" \"coincidence,\" \"simultaneous,\" and \"almost the same.\" This was a mark left behind by his past experiences.\nHe tapped his finger on the edge of the long mottled table and decided to make preparations for his worries.\nHe quickly condensed a light that contained certain words and some kind of will, and he threw it into a prayer light.\nAfter doing this, Klein made his consciousness sink and left Sefirah Castle, allowing his mind to return to his original body.\nImmediately after, he began to influence Utopia. He planned to use all sorts of arrangements to temporarily make all the foreigners \"leave.\"\nThis way, even if anything happened, it wouldn't affect the innocent.\nThis also meant that Klein was prepared to abandon Utopia and change locations to rebuild his marionette town. After all, a ritual could be repeated many times, but he could only afford one resurrection.\n...\n\"Have a good rest for the next two days. There's still some time left before court begins.\" Biles sent Wendel to the entrance of the Irises Hotel.\nWendel replied with a smile, \"I'm already feeling sleepy.\"\nIt was in the middle of the night. He had trouble sleeping previously because of his anxiety and nervousness. That was why he thought of walking around the headquarters of MI9 to ease his mood. However, when he heard the conversation between his colleagues at night, it triggered an eruption in his emotions, and he decided to return to Utopia and face the problem.\nAfter checking in, Wendel took his luggage and went to the third floor.\nWhen he passed through the door, he vaguely felt that his surroundings were abnormally dark.\nIn order to sleep better, Wendel walked to the window and drew the curtains.\nDuring this process, he felt that the scenery outside the window was unusually familiar.\nHowever, under the cover of the night, he couldn't tell what was happening too clearly. Thinking that it might have been the scene he had seen in Utopia previously, he covered his mouth with his hand and yawned. He took off his clothes and walked towards the bed.\n...\nMonica slept until midnight when she suddenly needed to pee.\nUnable to hold it in any longer, she eventually got out of bed and walked towards her room's attached bathroom.\nWhen she pushed the bathroom door open, she found it a little heavier.\nRubbing her eyes that were almost unable to open, Monica didn't care about this small change. She quickly relieved herself and ran out of the bathroom to her bed.\nWhen she entered the covers, she felt that the temperature was much lower and she had no choice but to wrap herself up tightly in layers.\nIt didn't take long for her to fall asleep again.\n...\nAbout 15 minutes later, the patrolling Biles rubbed his hands and turned towards the street where the police station was. He was about to hand over duties with his colleagues.\nSuddenly, his body froze in the alley.\nThe black and dense Spirit Body Threads on his body peeled off at the same time as they floated upwards.\nA pruned and exquisite paper figurine landed and connected to the Spirit Body Threads, quickly turning into another Biles.\nAt the same time, a torrent of mixed knowledge surged over and reassembled him into a man wearing gorgeous clothes with long chestnut hair.\nThe man had blue eyes, a high nose bridge, and thin lips. It was Roselle Gustav's Sequence 1 historical projection.\nRight on the heels of that, the projection reached out and sucked all the information in the surroundings into its palm, forming an illusory ball of light.\nThis information included all the details that involved Biles.\nIn the next second, Roselle Gustav's historical projection forged a piece of information that was completely normal, allowing it to follow the Spirit Body Threads connected to the paper figurine to the Saint Arianna Cathedral in the municipal square, moving straight underground of the cathedral.\nAfter this series of actions, another torrent of information surged in midair. With Roselle's help, they reformed into three figures.\nA middle-aged man wearing a black robe and a hood with a long, thick, white beard; another, who was draped in a cloak, had black hair, blue eyes, and a rather squarish face. He was a middle-aged man with a dignified bearing; on one of the trees, there was a huge tree that seemed to be drenched with petroleum. On the tree, there were arms with all sorts of strange protruding objects that rolled with bloodshot eyes.\n\"They\" were:\nThe leader of the Secret Order, Zaratul!\nLoen's Protector, the first King, William Augustus I's historical projection!\nA historical projection of Abomination Suah!\nAfter making the necessary preparations, Zaratul used the location provided by the historical projection to sneak into Utopia.\n\"He\" didn't waste any time. \"He\" reached out with \"His\" right hand and used the law of convergence of Beyonder characteristics to suck out the Worm of Spirit in Biles.\nElsewhere, the palm of Abomination Suah's historical projection made an ugly doll the size of a palm appear.\nThe doll was wet and sticky. It had no eyes, ears, or nose. It only had a pinhole-like mouth that emitted and sucked grayish-white fog.\nAs the Worm of Spirit and the doll approached, the black-and-white eyeballs that rolled out on the Suah tree trunk looked at them at the same time.\nSilently, the Worm of Spirit fused with the ugly doll, causing it to distort as it squirmed, growing out eyes, nose, and ears, making it look like Klein Moretti.\nAt this point, Zaratul no longer did any concealment, nor could \"He\" do so. \"He\" took out a black shroud and abruptly wrapped Klein's doll up!\nAll the marionette's Spirit Body Threads in Utopia were severed at the same time-they were unable to connect to the true body.\nThis wasn't because there was something wrong with them, but that the true body was isolated from them.\nAll of a sudden, the duty personnel in the police station, tenants in the hotel, Tracey and the thieves in the cell, Anderson in another apartment, Alzu, and the other citizens all stopped breathing and turned stiff.\nRegardless of whether they were sleeping or doing something else, it was as if a pause button had been pressed.\nKlein, who was at the bottom of Saint Arianna Cathedral, suddenly woke up. He knew that an accident had happened.\nHe didn't hesitate. With a thought, he returned to Sefirah Castle. With the level and strength of a King of Angels, he was able to resist enemies that had shown or had yet to show themselves.\nThis was the best choice in the current situation.\nEven if he wasn't able to protect his true body, Klein still had a chance to revive.\nAt that moment, his floating consciousness touched an invisible, dark barrier, making it difficult to penetrate it and enter Sefirah Castle.\nThis... Klein's heart tightened, believing that the enemy might be more troublesome than he had imagined.\nFew high-level existences knew he could return to Sefirah Castle with a thought!\nIn the next second, the thick, petroleum-slathered tree had arrived above Saint Arianna Cathedral.\nIn addition, a deep and dignified voice resounded:\n\"Wandering is prohibited here!\n\"Teleportation is prohibited here!\n\"...\"\nKlein wasn't led by his emotions. Seeing that he couldn't return to Sefirah Castle at the moment, he immediately changed his strategy and leaped towards the fog of history.\nThe moment the grayish-white fog entered his eyes, it turned into a whirlpool formed by countless transparent maggots. The vortex extended out slippery tentacles covered with strange patterns.\nUnlike previously, the vortex emitted a powerful suction force, causing Klein's figure to speed up and be entangled by countless tentacles.\nLaw of Beyonder characteristics convergence!\nThe law of Beyonder characteristic convergence between angels!\nA subtle beam of light flashed as Klein, who was firmly controlled by Zaratul's Mythical Creature form, turned into a paper figurine.\nThis was an angel-level application of Paper Figurine Substitutes, as well as the help of \"Grafting.\"\nAlthough Klein couldn't return to Sefirah Castle, he could influence the Worms of Spirit above the gray fog, allowing them to use the \"curtain\" to provide help.\nAfter dodging Zaratul's fatal blow, Klein ran into the fog of history and fled towards the former metropolis from a time before the First Epoch.\nAt this moment, many marionettes, who had been dead for a long time in Utopia, rapidly decayed from losing the Spirit Body Threads maintaining them. Their limbs dropped to the ground or mutated because of their Beyonder characteristics. The latter transformed into different monsters, ones far more terrifying than imaginable.\nSome swallowed their heads; others were left with only squirming flesh, while others grew dense eyes...\nSoon, Klein ran into the old metropolis situated inside the fog of history.\nTo him, this was a safe room that could be trusted. This was because only a Scholar of Yore who was a human from before history could enter.\nWithout any hesitation, Klein habitually surveyed the area and began praying to the Evernight Goddess in the stacked city.\nOof!\nA faint sound rang out as an ancient wooden stake with traces of blood penetrated Klein's heart from behind.\nA figure phased into existence behind him. It was a cold-looking man wearing a half top hat and a black trench coat:\nGehrman Sparrow.\nKlein's pupils dilated as the crazy adventurer said in a deep voice, \"Adam has given me humanity.\""}
{"num_chp":187,"summary":"The actions of the messenger shocked Klein for a full five seconds before he recovered. He bent over and picked up the letter.\n\"Even if Mr. Azik is unable to use a good portion of his abilities as a Beyonder, because of his memory loss, being able to send out such a messenger should make him powerful enough to deal with a Sequence 7 or 6 Beyonder.\"His heart reflected his shocked and envious expression. He didn't unfold the letter immediately. Instead, he placed the letter into his pocket, together with the Slumber Charms.\nThe carriage continued forward. When Klein exited the carriage at Daffodil Street, he instinctively looked at the driver, Cesare, only to see his relaxed smile, as if he hadn't noticed anything unusual that had happened.\nKlein nodded and returned home after observing Cesare with his Spirit Vision.\nHe looked at the balcony and pipes on the second floor and pondered for a few seconds. He decided to maintain his gentlemanly behavior and not attempt to scale the pipe back into his room. As for his stained clothes, he would take them to the Blackthorn Security Company tomorrow and get a professional to wash them through the police department. That would prevent his clothes from shocking his maid Bella and his sister Melissa.\nKlein had removed the reverse lock on the front door before he leaped out the window from the second floor. Now, he took advantage of the fact that it was late at night and quietly opened the door to his house, deftly making his way in.\nAfter closing and locking the main door, he heaved a sigh of relief. He went up to the second floor with hushed footsteps.\nStopping before his locked bedroom, Klein took out a tarot card calmly. He inserted it into the slit of the door and lightly pulled, easily breaking the specialized lock he designed himself.\nHe then entered the room, locked the door, and removed his clothes, before he fully relaxed.\nIt sure feels like being a thief...Klein laughed as he shook his head. He calmly took out his revolver and placed it under the pillow.\nAfter he was finished with all of that, he lit up the gas lamp and sat in front of his desk. He took out the letter and began reading seriously.\n\"I'm sorry for replying only now. I've been busy searching for traces of my past. I've also been meeting up with former teachers and students and those drag on late into the night.\n\"I finally understand the encounters that I've had over the past two days after reading your letter. The police searched every room in the hotel that I'm staying at. There was a person who secretly snooped around in the hotel at night. Yes, I'm talking about a person with Beyonder powers.\n\"... So Rear Admiral Hurricane Qilangos, who's a frequent character in novels and newspapers, has infiltrated Backlund and has gone on quite a killing spree. I remember that he's not only wanted by the Loen Kingdom, he's also on the bounty list of the Feysac Empire, the Intis Republic, the Feynapotter Kingdom...\"\nSo, how much is the bounty?Klein subconsciously wondered.\nHe didn't get an answer because Azik had switched to mentioning something else.\n\"I find the abilities of a Shepherd that you described quite familiar, it's as if I've seen it somewhere, but I cannot remember where. It must be an encounter from one of my past lives. Not being able to recall it makes me very frustrated.\"\nEh, Mr. Azik is a little interested in the Shepherd. I can use this to get him to help me. Yes, this sure is coincidental... No, this is not a coincidence, but inevitable!\nIt can be inferred that Mr. Azik has lived for over a thousand years and is most likely a High-Sequence Beyonder. Then, he would most likely have encountered the powers of many different Beyonders in his earlier lives. He would also have deeper impressions of those that were more unique... In other words, it isn't only the Shepherd that would give him feelings of familiarity, but jobs such as the Unshadowed, Demon Hunter, or Guardian that would do so as well...\nIt's highly likely that Mr. Azik would find any mystical item that corresponds to a particular Sequence's abilities familiar and have his interest piqued. That's something that can be imagined...\nKlein was doubtful at first before being enlightened. He was a lot more certain as a result.\nHe shifted his gaze and continued to read the letter.\n\"I've long recalled some parts of the sacrificial ritual you asked about, probably because I have a deeper impression of them. Perhaps I was a priest in my one of my more recent lifetimes.\n\"I have to remind you and warn you, that you have to be very cautious when using sacrificial rituals. You cannot entrust your safety to evil gods or hidden, mysterious existences. They do not have consciences like we do.\n\"Also, you have to possess a strong sense of right and wrong, for the evil gods and devils often create seemingly harmless identities for themselves. My opinion is that you cannot sacrifice something whose presence you are not fully aware of; otherwise, your soul could end up being the sacrificial item.\"\nIn simple terms, evil gods and devils will take on another form, disguising themselves as someone trustworthy... Just like on the Internet, an account that claims to be a seemingly adorable chick might be controlled by a huge bloke... He had to be cautious even if they were to meet offline after confirming the person's looks, as the person might just be cross-dresser...Klein didn't disregard Azik's warning just because he was conducting the sacrificial ritual for himself. He nodded in approval.\nAfter Azik emphasized a few things he had to look out for, he quickly explained the sacrificial ritual he knew of.\n\"First, set up the ritual. Choose the symbols based on which deity or unorthodox mysterious existence you are going to offer a sacrifice to. Use the corresponding herbs and minerals of \u2018His' or \u2018Her' domain. Of course, you can also make them into holy oils, ointments, scents, and other items in advance.\"\nSymbols?Klein froze for a moment. He realized that he-The Fool that didn't belong to this era-didn't know what his corresponding symbol was...\nHe thought for a moment, quickly recalling the complex symbol on the back of his chair at the ancient bronze table. It was made up of a Pupil-less Eye which represented secrecy, and the partial contorted lines which represented change.\nThat should be my symbol, or more accurately, that is what symbolizes me in the world above the gray fog. My domain is much simpler then-secrecy, change, good luck... But I cannot be too sure of that, so I'll have to try it out... Even if the symbol is wrong, as long as I get my honorary name right, the target of the sacrifice wouldn't point towards some other entity. The worst thing that could happen is that the ritual would fail. Of that, I'm certain...Klein thought as he rubbed the surface of the paper as he formulated a plan in his heart.\nHis eyes focused on the letter once again, reading the rest of the letter.\n\"Second, you need to be clear if the sacrifice needs to happen at a specific time. Then, follow the processes of a normal ritual, until you finish reciting the honorable names and incantations of the ritual.\n\"You must remember to use either Jotun, Dragonese, Elvish, or ancient Hermes. You must use the natural powers in these languages to establish a direct connection with the corresponding entity. You can design the exact incantations to use, but it must include these critical terms: \u2018pray,' \u2018notice,' \u2018offer,' \u2018kingdom,' \u2018gates,' and \u2018open.'\n\"Finally, you must use materials that have a certain spirituality quality to create a connection with the natural powers of the incantation. This will allow you to construct a tunnel that connects to the gates of the kingdom where the corresponding entity resides. If the entity is interested, then your sacrifice is complete.\n\"This step isn't absolutely necessary. If you can make the corresponding entity very interested in your sacrifice, then \u2018He' will open the gates to \u2018His' kingdom for you after you finish reciting the incantations, establishing a stable tunnel on \u2018His' own accord. Of course, this would often imply danger as the orthodox result as relatively friendly hidden gods rarely do this. Only evil gods or devils would reply to you directly in order to achieve their goals.\"\nMaterials that have spirituality are not cheap... I wonder if merely reciting the incantations would allow me to open a sacrificial tunnel similar to the Door of Summoning? I wonder if I could make use of the abilities of the world above the gray fog... Yes, I'll try that first and only get the materials with spirituality from the underground market if I fail. Do I need Beyonder ingredients? It should be fine if it possesses a certain amount of spirituality, right?Klein thought about the 300 pounds lying around in his anonymous account. He also thought about the 10 plus pounds of savings that he had saved up.\nBeyonder materials were not completely identical to materials that possessed spirituality. For example, the heart that Hood Eugen left behind was a Beyonder ingredient while the black scales were a material possessing certain amounts of spirituality.\nAfter he finished reading Mr. Azik's letter, Klein rubbed his fingers together and ignited a flame of spirituality. He burned the paper to ash and threw it into the rubbish bin.\nIt was already deep into the night and Klein was in no hurry to try the ritual. He intended to first make a plan and go through everything that he needed to take note of before putting it into practice.\nHe had a vague understanding of his shortcomings long ago. He was cautious and rational when it came to things he made plans for, but once the events deviated from his original plans, he would easily consider only the good and disregard the bad when he was forced to be on his toes.\nA simpler description would be that a rash action of his would easily cause him to court death... Klein extended his palm to cover his face.\nThe next day, Dunn Smith, who had communicated with the Mandated Punishers and Machinery Hivemind, started to assign missions. Klein also received his assignment. He was tasked to investigate a number of people who had connections to Lanevus. But because of his suggestion and the policy of the Nighthawks, he didn't have to be responsible for the people he had met previously.\nOf course, Klein continued with his combat lessons in the afternoon. Nor did Dunn assign him the role of lead investigator.\n...\nBacklund, Hillston Backlund. In a building with a horse stable and garden.\nQilangos, who had a unique wide chin and dark green eyes, looked at the unconscious man before him. He took off the man's clothes and wore them.\nHe then leisurely walked in front of the dressing mirror and saw the black glove on his left hand twitch. He saw many contorted lines appearing on its back.\nA few seconds later, Qilangos saw a thin veil of light envelop his figure. His muscles, skin, and bones began undergoing a strange transformation.\nSometime later, he transformed into the unconscious man, completely identical in height, appearance, and demeanor!"}
{"num_chp":1233,"summary":"Ever since the war became prolonged, the Loen soldiers had seen countless unnatural phenomena. It happened so many that they were somewhat numb to it. However, the scene of the dismembered corpses crawling up remained a shocking scene. It left them horrified and confused. They felt as though they were unable to survive the impending disaster, and would eventually become zombies.\nOf course, there was a reason why they were able to maintain their morale after seeing such unnatural phenomena.\nJust as they were feeling extreme fear, a series of chants sounded from behind them.\n\"Lacking clothes and food, they have no shelter in the cold.\n\"...\n\"The Evernight did not forsake them, but bestowed them with love[1].\"\nThe holy and sympathetic prayer reverberated across the entire defense line, causing the fear in every soldier to quickly dissipate, their bodies and minds turning tranquil.\nThen, a number of the soldiers followed orders and moved out cannons covered in silver patterns. They adjusted the muzzles and aimed at the dismembered corpses that were rushing at them.\nBoom! Boom! Boom!\nSparks flew as shells landed in different spots on the battlefield, exploding and emitting a thick darkness.\nThe dismembered corpses collapsed, the strength within them vanishing; otherwise, they were directly destroyed, returning to their eternal slumber.\nThe mysterious black-robed man behind the Resistance army raised his arms upon seeing this, as though he was hugging the crimson moon.\nAt that moment, his body suddenly turned incorporeal, his body dyed a faint red as he transformed into a hazy ray of moonlight.\nThe moonlight shattered instantly, turning into red scales before dissipating in place.\nMoonlight Transformation!\nThis was a Beyonder power that a Sequence 5 Scarlet Scholar of the Apothecary pathway possessed. To a Sequence 4 Shaman King, it was almost instinctive.\nAnd at the spot where the Shaman King had been, a figure quickly outlined itself.\nIt was a huge cloth doll. \"It\" had blonde hair and bright red eyes, and wore a long black gothic dress with countless mysterious patterns engraved on it. Swirling around it was sinister vines. Its skin had a luster that no human should possess.\nReinette Tinekerr!\n\"She\" had used the Staff of the Stars to summon \"Herself\" back when she was in perfect condition.\nOf course, the Staff of the Stars that was lent to Miss Messenger was the real one. Klein had brought it back to the real world from above the gray fog ahead of time.\nIf that wasn't the case, it would be equivalent to Klein's historical projection summoning a Staff of the Stars projection; then, the projection of the Staff of the Stars would summon Reinette Tinekerr in her peak state. The whole burden would be placed on Fors, causing her spirituality to be quickly drained.\nA solution to this problem was to temporarily lend the actual Staff of the Stars to Reinette Tinekerr. The draining of spirituality would be borne by this Ancient Bane.\nAt the same time, Reinette Tinekerr was probably one of the existences that were the least afraid of the negative effects of the staff.\nAs a key representative of the temperance faction, and as a Puppet and a \"cloth doll,\" \"She\" could stop unwanted scenes from surfacing in \"Her\" mind. And after changing into a concealed state, the Staff of the Stars could hardly affect \"Her\" Historical Void projection.\nThe peak state Reinette Tinekerr had attempted to sneak closer to directly possess the Rose School of Thought's Shaman King and instantly end the battle. However, the other party had discovered the danger ahead of time. Using the moonlight's illumination, he was one step ahead of the Wraith's possession.\nAmidst the crimson glow that enveloped the ground, red scales rapidly reformed into the black-robed, hooded Rose School of Thought Shaman King. His eyes were closed eyes tightly, not daring to look at the Ancient Bane opposite him.\nAt the same time, on the other side of the battlefield, a figure rapidly appeared. It was none other than Gehrman Sparrow, who was wearing a black trench coat and a half top hat. He had a transparent glove on his left hand as he raised his right hand and snapped his fingers.\nScarlet flames rose up from various parts of the battlefield, as if they were announcing the beginning of a grand performance.\nJust as the Shaman King finished reforming, he reached out his left hand and tore apart the clothes on his chest. At that moment, Reinette Tinekerr's bright red eyes reflected his figure.\nIf things went as expected, the Rose School of Thought Shaman King would've transformed into a rabbit or a goat in the next second. He would \"lose\" most of his characteristics and Beyonder powers, but his body only emitted a faint glow without any change.\nHis exposed chest revealed a long, thin brown puppet which was embedded there.\nThe puppet seemed to grow out of the Shaman King's body, its body connected to his internal organs. Its eyes and mouth were like crescents. The surface of its body was grown with dried flowers and withered grass, giving off an indescribable bizarreness in the moonlight.\nSuddenly, the puppet was dyed red as though it was soaked in blood.\nIt immediately turned into a pool of mud that surged into the organs of the Shaman King.\nAmidst the mud, an arm stretched out.\nIts surface was flowing with a black sticky liquid that kept protruding out with strange objects. Some were skulls, some had barbed tongues, while others had three-dimensional eyes.\nAbomination Suah!\nThis Rose School of Thought's leader, an existence at Sequence 1, had crossed the vast distance and descended with the help of prior arrangements!\nThat evil aura instantly caused the surrounding members of the Rose School of Thought and supporting members to either die, mutate, or wildly attack their comrades. Apart from the Shaman King, no one was spared.\n...\nWest Balam, in a port city.\nShaman King Klarman, who wielded the highest authority here, stood at the top floor of a cathedral that once belonged to the Church of Evernight as he looked down at the sparsely-lit city.\nIn a house not far away, Emlyn White glanced at the doll-like Sharron and took out a bronze box with many ruby gems embedded in it.\nInside the box was an eyeball-shaped glass sphere. It was a Sealed Artifact which Emlyn had requested from the Sanguine, known as the Vision of White-an artifact of the Sun domain.\nIt was very effective at dealing with the Mutant pathway's demigods and Shaman Kings. It could even be considered able to restrain them in certain aspects.\nOf course, it wouldn't feel any sense of pity and kindness just because Emlyn and Sharron were Beyonders on its side.\nUpon seeing Sharron nod slightly to indicate that there were no problems, Emlyn's body phased away as the moonlight that shone into the room, and he disintegrated into a series of colorful red scales.\nAt the apex of the nearby cathedral, Klarman was pacing back and forth with his puffy, black-and-white hair. He sneered at the city's Nighthawks and Mandated Punishers for moving the Loen citizens and all the Sealed Artifacts away ahead of time.\nIf the group consisted only of Beyonders, it wouldn't be impossible to escape, but with so many ordinary people, how can you effectively move without being noticed? There's no need for me to send people to track you. Simply locking down the surrounding docks and food supplies is enough to break you down without my interference...\nAs he muttered silently to himself, this Shaman King, who had been active in the Southern Continent since the early Fifth Epoch and was even suspected to be dead, cast his gaze out the window and stared at the crimson moon high in the sky.\nPreviously, the abnormal phenomenon of the \"crimson moon turning white\" made Klarman feel the anger of the Primordial Moon. He had always felt uneasy and disturbed.\nHe had become a Primordial Moon believer over time while researching natural interactions, secret deeds, and other mysterious knowledge.\nNormally, it was relatively easy for a Shaman King to live a thousand years, but later on, his physical condition waned-an irreversible form of aging and the decay of his Spirit Body. Therefore, 1,200 years was commonly the natural limit of Shaman Kings and Sanguine Earls. To continue living, one could only rely on various methods to survive. For example, sealing oneself and sleeping in a coffin deep within a castle.\nKlarman was nearly 1400 years old and still brimming with energy. He didn't need to limit his movements, because he had received the Primordial Moon's blessings.\nThis was also the reason why he had disappeared for so many years.\nLater on, he received a revelation from the Primordial Moon and joined the Rose School of Thought.\nIn this aspect, Klarman always had his suspicions. Sometimes, he believed that the Mother Tree of Desire and the Primordial Moon were one entity. They were different sides of the same great existence. Yet, there were other times when he felt that the Mother Tree of Desire and the Primordial Moon were not only different, but there was also a deep conflict between them.\nThis resulted in the Primordial Moon believers not getting enough attention when they later joined the Rose School of Thought. Apart from receiving some bestowments in the form of items, they were placed in noncritical positions.\nJust as Klarman was focused on sensing the crimson moon in an attempt to gain a revelation, the crimson moonlight that fell onto the cathedral's bell tower had pure red scales of light appear as they gathered together. It then manifested into Emlyn White who wore a tuxedo and a bow tie.\nBehind this Sanguine, a thick black gas emanated, forming a pair of illusory bat wings.\nEmlyn had already consumed the corresponding potion to remove his scent and spirituality fluctuations, allowing him to approach his target in secret.\nOf course, he was up against a demigod, a Sequence 4 demigod of the same pathway. Even if he was fully prepared, he didn't dare get too close, or else he would easily be discovered.\nLooking at the window where Shaman King Klarman was, he examined the projection on the glass for a second. Emlyn White opened the bronze box with the rubies embedded in it, and he used his black velvet-gloved left hand to pick up the Vision of White.\nHis expression twisted as he experienced the pain that came from being exposed to the blazing sun.\nSuppressing the pain, Emlyn pushed the eyeball-shaped glass sphere to his right eye.\nAll the buildings in front of him had suddenly disappeared from his vision, leaving only shadows of cold, crimson, or fallen evil.\nAmong them, there was a figure that was like a huge black whirlpool that was crazily devouring the light around it, causing his body to become distorted.\nThis was Emlyn's target, the ancient Shaman King, Klarman.\nA ray of light immediately lit up, condensing into a scorching, blinding light. It shot out from the Vision of White and went straight for the figure behind the glass window.\n[1] Adapted from Job 24:8, Old Testament."}
{"num_chp":658,"summary":"The Black Tulip... Admiral Hell Ludwell... This is jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire... Aren't we a little too unlucky?Floating in midair, Klein was the first to discover the approaching ship. He couldn't help but turn his head to look down at Anderson, who was wielding his pitch-black sword and seriously observing the monster.\nAnderson quickly returned the gaze in puzzlement. As he remained wary against the grayish-black flesh which could shoot out at any moment, he asked, \"The look you are giving me is very strange. Did something happen again...\"\nJust as he said that, he reflexively shut his mouth and sensed something. With a leap, he dodged the monster's splintered body which was making his fingernails rapidly grow. He quickly arrived at the other side of the ship.\nAs he straightened his back, Anderson suddenly hissed.\n\"Admiral Hell...\"\nHe wasn't a good person. As a pirate admiral who was infamous for killing indiscriminately, he didn't have any psychological burdens when it came to earning profit by \"fishing\" in troubled waters.\nOnce he weighed the situation and realized that he could use the powerful monster to finish off Admiral of Stars and everyone on the Future while also receiving tremendous spoils of war, he would definitely take action!\nMy bad luck hasn't decreased at all. It has only switched to a lump sum withdrawal?Anderson's expression warped, it was a mystery on whether he was crying or laughing.\nAt the same time, the corresponding information surfaced in Klein's mind.\nJust the bounty placed on Admiral Hell Ludwell's head by Loen alone had reached 55,000 pounds!\nHe was an extremely powerful member of the Seven Pirate Admirals, the one with the highest bounty among the Seven Pirate Admirals!\nHis flagship, the Black Tulip, didn't have many pirates living on it. Most of the jobs were left to undead creatures or the spirit world creatures he controlled.\nHe killed indiscriminately, but he didn't have a sick fetish for killing. All he did was seriously complete his job of sending living creatures to hell.\nHe had all kinds of connections with the Numinous Episcopate. The rumors state that he possesses a ring left behind by the ancient Death!\nWhile Klein and Anderson were looking at the Black Tulip, the golden brooch on Cattleya's robe began to emit a pure bright light instead of blinding sunlight.\nIn front of the captain's cabin was a blurry figure that was rapidly increasing in length.\nIt was filled with the silence and serenity of a specter's aura, but it also emitted a warmth resembling sunlight.\nThis was an extraordinarily incongruent existence. It was as though a wraith had been created out of Sun Holy Water!\nIt was both holy and evil!\nThe Sun Wraith widened its arms as it flew out at ludicrous speeds and hugged the grayish-black flesh.\nThe sizzling sound of fat and oils burning sounded out. The Sun Wraith and the grayish-black flesh canceled each other out as they were simultaneously obliterated, leaving no traces behind.\nThe dark purple hue in the Admiral of Stars's eyes flowed as the brooch brightened. It quickly produced another Sun Wraith outside the window of the captain's cabin as it pounced towards the grayish-black flesh that had invaded the Future.\nAnd at this moment, Bloodless Heath Doyle protected Frank, Nina, and the other sailors. He used the devouring and digesting method in order to resist the monster's flesh which possessed immense vitality.\nThe Black Tulip's speed was faster than Klein had anticipated. In seconds, it had entered a range which was cause for alarm for the Future.\nThe black sailboat with a gloomy green slowed down and stopped to the side. It didn't seem to be aware of what had happened.\nSuddenly, Klein saw a nearly transparent eye surface around the Future's airspace. It had ghastly-pale eye whites as it looked down from above without blinking.\nThis... is a Spirit Medium's version of a telescope?After a momentary pause, Klein drew his revolver with his right hand and aimed at the eye that belonged to a spirit world creature.\nAt that moment, he was somewhat hesitant. As the crazy adventurer, Gehrman Sparrow, to directly fire was the choice that matched his persona the best. But at this moment, Admiral Hell Ludwell had yet to show any signs of animosity. He might have qualms about the faction backing Cattleya and hold back. If Klein were to rashly kill the \"telescope,\" it would undoubtedly push the situation into the direction of a more chaotic and dangerous development!\nDuring that brief dilemma, the nearly transparent illusory eye vanished. A distance away, the Black Tulip continued approaching as it became clearer and clearer.\nHigh above the Black Tulip, white skeletons, who didn't wear clothes or leather armor, busily controlled the sails while pale zombies patrolled the area with cutlasses in hand. The latter were observing their surroundings with green burning eyes. Shadows, wraiths, and all sorts of strange spirit world creatures were flying in circles, boring through the ship at times as the shipboard protruded transparent faces that weren't too obvious.\nAmidst Klein's Spirit Vision, the Black Tulip only had one living person. It was the man dressed like a captain, who was silently standing on the deck.\nHe wore an exaggerated triangular hat with a white skull and feathers on it. He wore a lace-trimmed white shirt and a heavy and magnificent brown coat. The ox-hide belt which held his white tights had a thin rapier hanging off it.\nThe man wore a silver mask. His facial features and contours were hidden within. The holes that depicted his eyes, nose, and mouth had cold lines that left one shuddering.\nThis matched the rumored image of Admiral Hell Ludwell!\nWhere are his first mate, second mate, third mate, and boatswain?Klein was first surprised at the lack of living personnel on the Black Tulip before quickly coming to a realization.\nJust like how the third mate, the gunner commander, and many of the sailors of the Future were sent to the other ships of the pirate crew, only the minimum number of personnel were used to enter these waters. Admiral Hell Ludwell didn't let his \"weak\" subordinates follow him. After all, he could control the undead and spirit world creatures to steer the ship.\nAt this moment, the Black Tulip clearly turned around and aimed its starboard side over.\nAs Admiral Hell Ludwell touched his silver mask, a salvo of shots rang out.\nCannonballs flew over, some falling into the sea before they came close, producing splashes; others overshot and fell somewhere even further away.\nThis was a calibration shot!\nSoon, the Black Tulip produced a second volley of bombarding cannon fire.\nKlein was just about to activate Creeping Hunger and use the Baron of Corruption's Distortion power to change the target of the cannonballs, sending them further away when he saw Anderson Hood raise his right hand and push it forward.\nOrange-yellow Fire Ravens instantly condensed as they accurately flew out to intercept each and every cannonball!\nBoom! Boom! Boom!\nBlinding flames were emitted in midair as debris scattered, it was as though dozens of fireworks were set on display.\nI have to say that a Pyromaniac's powers are very useful at sea. It's a mystic version of a ballistic missile defense system. However, this is because Anderson is the Strongest Hunter and has already reached Sequence 5. If it were Danitz, there's no way he could block them all. It would be pretty impressive if he could trigger half of them... Sigh, when I use Flame Controlling, I can only deal with one cannonball at a time...As Klein sighed, the Black Tulip ceased its bombardment and changed its speed again, closing the gap between it and the Future.\nAs it approached, the surface of the sea between the two gigantic sailboats which was dyed with golden sunlight rapidly turned black. It didn't look like ink, but the darkest night without any moon or stars.\nTranslucent and illusory ferocious creatures crawled out of this dark sea. Pale corpses reached out their palms which had rotten flesh dangling from them as dark red or cold flames emerged, forming pairs of eyes.\nSuddenly, the area seemed to turn into the entrance to hell. All kinds of undead creatures floated on the surface of the sea in dense numbers as they charged forward like an unending tidal wave.\nAnderson looked back at the Sun Wraiths which were obliterating the grayish-black flesh, and he knew that Admiral of Stars was at a critical moment in dealing with the terrifying monster. All he could do was draw a gasp and look up at Gehrman Sparrow with a bitter smile.\nJust as he was about to press his hands onto the shipboard to create scarlet flames that spread outwards to prevent the invasion of the undead army, he was surprised to see Gehrman Sparrow turn around and fly back into his cabin.\nH-he fled? No way...Anderson's expression clearly froze.\nHe grimaced as he hurriedly leaned forward with his extended palms to press onto the shipboard.\nSilently, a swath of scarlet flames soared into the sky and swept the area ahead of him.\nAt this moment, a charm suddenly fell in front of him as he heard a word spoken in ancient Hermes.\n\"Storm!\"\nHuh?Anderson instinctively looked up and saw Gehrman Sparrow in his round neck shirt and brown jacket being swept up by a squall as he rapidly flew towards the Black Tulip.\nI-is he committing suicide? I can't understand such madness...Anderson turned agape as he felt puzzled.\nWhoosh!\nWith the charm's effects and the blessings of the wind, Klein flew to the airspace above the bow of the Black Tulip.\nAdmiral Hell Ludwell immediately looked up at him. The eyes behind the silver mask burned silently with two pale-white flames.\nThe shadows, wraiths, and the spirit world creatures of the Death domain who were spiraling above the Black Tulip immediately swarmed towards the enemy.\nThey either opened their mouths, letting out silence screeches, or they extended their long tongues with shrunken faces as though they were extremely excited.\nKlein looked at them with a deadpan expression as he reached into his pocket with his left hand, releasing the wall of spirituality on a squarish box.\nThen, he took out Azik's copper whistle, which was tied to a few matchsticks, and threw them at the deck of the Black Tulip's stern.\nSuddenly, the transparent, cold, and indistinct shadows and wraiths paused. It was as though they were frozen worms.\nFollowing that, they didn't hesitate to turn their bodies to rapidly fly to the stern of the Black Tulip. The strange-looking spirit world creatures followed closely behind.\nIn less than a second, the skeletons and zombies who were adjusting the cannons betrayed Admiral Hell. The bow was left completely empty except for Ludwell.\nPa!\nKlein landed on the deck while pressing down on his cap, landing right before Ludwell.\nHis body was bent slightly as he released the right hand on his cap, his gaze locked on the silver-masked Admiral Hell."}
{"num_chp":966,"summary":"Seeing Alfred look over, Klein returned with a smile and nodded gently.\n\"I suddenly sensed some danger.\"\nWith that said, he calmly turned around and headed for the carriage which Haggis had pointed out.\n\"Danger...\" Alfred repeated the word softly as he warily surveyed his surroundings but failed to find anything odd.\nHe slowed down his pace, constantly taking note of his surroundings before returning to the nearby three-story building with out-of-the-ordinary vigilance.\nPagani glanced at the heavy-expression wearing Alfred and asked, feeling somewhat puzzled, \"What happened?\"\nHe was quite a distance from the arms deal, so he hadn't heard their conversation.\nAlfred walked to the window and looked down at the convoy that was prepared to leave after loading the munitions. He deliberated and said, \"Dwayne Dant\u00e8s suddenly left, saying that he had sensed danger.\"\n\"Danger?\" Pagani didn't dismiss it as he warily looked around. He didn't notice anything amiss even when Maysanchez's men left the region and vanished into the darkness.\nHe then laughed.\n\"Haha, Alfred, I think you're too sensitive. I believe it's solely because Dwayne Dant\u00e8s is a coward and was unwilling to stay here for too long!\"\nAlfred retracted his gaze and frowned.\n\"Perhaps.\"\nAfter returning to his hotel, Klein made Enzo, who had turned into a mixed-blood lad, open the suitcase in his hand. He took out the gold coins and bars one by one and did the count.\nIt was valued at a total of 30,000 Loen gold pounds!\nThankfully my previous agreement with Miss Messenger is 10,000 Loen gold coins. I don't need to make any additional conversions... Sitting leisurely in the reclining chair, Klein drank the sweet and sour but refreshing Gwadar as he \"monitored\" his marionette's work.\nAfter Enzo separated the items, he took out the adventurer's harmonica and blew into it.\nReinette Tinekerr walked out of the void with the four blonde, red-eyed heads in hand. It was as though she was constantly nearby.\nHer eight eyes turned towards the pile of gold coins and gold bars that had been separated.\nAfter a few seconds, the four heads in Reinette Tinekerr's hand said, \"Very good...\" \"In the future...\" \"Missions will...\" \"Cost more...\"\n...What's the logic behind this? Why are you raising the price after the mission despite me paying you so quickly? Klein was taken aback as he asked with a straightened back, \"What?\"\nReinette Tinekerr's four blonde, red-eyed heads nodded seriously.\n\"Mission...\" \"Price...\" \"Depends On...\" \"Your...\" \"Ability...\" \"To...\" \"Earn Money...\"\nI never expected that... Klein turned agape, but he was unable to retort. After all, such matters were solely decided by the helper. Furthermore, with him advancing to Sequence 4 and becoming a demigod, the missions that he needed her help with in the future was likely to increase in difficulty and danger. It was seemingly reasonable to increase the price.\nAfter Reinette Tinekerr swallowed the gold coins and vanished from the room, Klein reined in his thoughts and began doing calculations regarding his current wealth.\nMy expenses have been quite significant recently. I'm left with 17,275 pounds in cash and 65 gold coins... This pile of gold bars is worth 25,000 pounds... That makes for a total of more than 40,000 pounds. It's not something to dismiss in all of the Loen Kingdom. I can already buy a manor and some land for farming... Arms dealing sure is profitable...\nReinette Tinekerr needed gold coins, so whatever was left were gold bars.\nStanding up and sending the gold bars above the gray fog, Klein walked to the window and cast his gaze to the north.\nWith the matter coming to a close, he was poised to return to Backlund.\nLooking at the horizon, Klein suddenly sighed silently.\nBacklund...\nNorth Borough, Backlund University of Technology.\nAudrey was touring the campus with a few staff members of the Loen Charity Bursary Foundation.\nShe was dressed in a simple, light-green dress. By her waist was a white, unadorned leather belt. Her blonde hair had a veiled hat with ribboned flowers that showed off her playful side. She didn't wear any other accessories other than a silver bangle on her left wrist. She looked no different from a female student that came from a family that could only be considered middle-class.\nOver the past few days, she had been to public primary schools that bordered East Borough, and she had visited the technical schools in the area around Backlund Bridge. She already knew the appropriate clothes needed for the occasion, not treating charity work as another social scene.\nHer green, limpid eyes darted around slightly as she wore a faint smile as she observed the students that came and went.\nBacklund University of Technology had recently sent out its acceptance letters, and it was matriculation day for the new class of students.\nMatriculation should've happened in late-August or early-September, but as a newly restructured university, Backlund University of Technology's entrance examinations were later than the other universities. That also delayed the results, which also meant that students that applied to the school had also participated in the examinations of other universities or might've already been accepted. Therefore, they had brought forward the registration work to confirm the matriculated numbers before deciding how many more students needed to be accepted.\nDue to this, Audrey and the Loen Charity Bursary Foundation's staff came to help the first batch of approved applicants to complete their matriculation procedure.\nWherever she could see, she discovered that the students on campus wore a beaming expression, and every action they made exuded obvious confidence. Their words and actions had an indescribable vigor, one that seemed to have immense hope for the future that allowed them to see light.\nAnd this feeling was completely different from the few public primary schools that Audrey had experienced in the past. The students there were either boorish and noisy or silent and gloomy. A common trait of theirs was being uneasy and confused. Whenever they encountered strangers of status, they would be filled with trepidation. Their eyes were dull, lacking the spirit that youths ought to have.\nI really wish those kids will have a chance of receiving higher education and be like the students here where they can work hard for a better future... As Audrey sighed silently, she swept her gaze to a male-female duo who were likely siblings.\nThe elder brother had clearly stepped into society and started working. He wore a silk hat and wore a rather thin black formal suit. He appeared to be in his thirties and had the air resembling a civil servant.\nHe had borrowed a rather old camera from somewhere and had placed it on a tripod. He gestured for his younger sister to move and adjust her pose as he searched for the best angle.\nThe sister was about seventeen or eighteen, and her black hair simply cascaded down. Her brown eyes had a look of exasperation, but she didn't say a word as she seriously listened to her brother's instructions.\nSuch combinations were everywhere on campus. Some of them had parents and their child, while others were groups of friends.\nWhat a beautiful scene... Audrey looked away and continued proceeding forward.\nIt was a square, and in the middle of it was a decommissioned steam locomotive. Its massive body was standing there proudly, adding industrial vibes to the Backlund University of Technology.\nWhoosh!\nThe behemoth-like steam locomotive spewed out smoke as it hauled its long body into the platform before slowing down a stop.\nA mixed-blood, seven- or eight-year-old girl who looked like a doll, held her mother's hand as she waited in a long line. She asked her father, who was similarly mixed-blood with Loen and Balam heritage, about Desi Bay.\nAmidst her shuffling, she saw a gentleman with white sideburns and a top hat holding a gold-inlaid cane. He had a servant with brown skin as he walked towards first-class.\nThe servant looked around curiously and said, \"Sir, the recent situation is different from what I had imagined. I thought the people from Balam would lead tough and difficult lives, with squalid, chaotic, poor, and repressed surroundings. But there was none of them. We even drank Gwadar and smoked East Balam cigarettes. There were even some people who could afford bikes. Uh, as you know, although I have Balam blood in me, I was born in Backlund. I've never been to the Southern Continent. Of course, my Dutanese is still not too bad.\"\nThe very noble middle-aged gentleman chuckled and waved his cane.\n\"That's because we only went to the cities and regions that aren't too bad. The saddest people of Balam are in the villages, in the plantations. The rest take up residence around the factories, creating slums. We never had a chance to see them.\"\nAs though sensing the girl's notice, the gentleman with his deep blue eyes and his servant looked over and gave a warm smile.\nThe corners of their lips clearly curled up, revealing eight teeth before they nodded gently, looked away, and continued on their way.\nBefore long, the girl and her parents boarded the steam locomotive and found their seats.\nWhen the whistle sounded again, the girl saw a man with dark brown skin, soft facial features, and red lumps on his cheek walk over with his head bowed. His hand pressed on his hat as he quickly walked down the aisle and headed for the head of the train.\nThe man knocked on the partition before quickly entering the operator's compartment and said to the train driver, \"All the train attendants have been swapped with our men. The bridge ahead is where the sacrifice will be held.\"\nWith a thick mustache, the train driver nodded and said, \"May God be satisfied with the sacrificial items on this train.\n\"Let's hope we can gain eternal life in the kingdom.\"\nWhoosh!\nThe steam locomotive drove under a bridge before cruising past a huge bridge. After a long trip, it finally arrived at its destination, the pier.\nThe doll-like, mixed-blood girl was somewhat sleepy and was no longer as lively as before. Under her parents' lead, she followed the crowd and inched towards the door.\nThere were a few attendants at the door who were helping some of the passengers remove their luggage.\nWhen the girl and her parents walked past, these attendants curled the corners of their lips and revealed eight teeth, showcasing a warm smile.\nAfter the girl jumped onto the platform, she looked back at them subconsciously. She saw figures standing outside the door, discussing something. Among them was the train conductor, as well as the man with the lumps on his cheek.\nA second later, these people turned their heads over and curled the corners of their lips, revealing eight teeth.\nThe girl retracted her gaze and skipped along as she left the platform with her parents."}
{"num_chp":1023,"summary":"His Majesty... Xio was a little confused and filled with confusion when she heard Viscount Stratford's reply.\nShe found it inexplicable that Shermane would deliberately approach this captain of the royal guards just to investigate where his loyalties lay. This didn't seem to be something of great importance or value.\nAs for Viscount Stratford's answer, it was very normal and without any faults.\nShermane paid with her life for such an answer? Xio originally wished to press for the reason behind Shermane's investigation of such a trivial matter, but she immediately realized that it might involve key intel too soon. It might cause Viscount Stratford, who hadn't entered the necessary \"state,\" to put up resistance. So she gradually held back her instinctive urge.\nShe thought for a moment and asked, \"Do you know Mason Dere?\"\n\"Yes,\" Viscount Stratford answered blankly.\nXio Derecha continued asking rather simple and unimportant questions.\n\"Who is he?\"\n\"He's the former captain of the royal guards,\" Viscount Stratford answered simply without elaborating.\nAt this moment, Fors didn't listen to the Telepathy at such a superficial layer. She took out the pure crystal ball and placed it in Xio's pocket.\nAfter transferring her items, she bent down once again and carefully attempted to pick up the bronze cross.\nThis time, amidst her trembling fingers, the soul-burning feeling didn't assault her. It allowed her to easily pick up the spiky item.\nAs expected, this cross cannot coexist with other mystical items... Uh, I still have Moon Paper Figurine and the remnant spirituality of the ancient wraiths, but it didn't react... This means that it can coexist with items that don't contain Beyonder characteristics, but won't resist spirituality and strength? If that's the case, will it also reject the Beyonder characteristic within my body? But it doesn't seem obvious... This is its other negative side effect, and it requires some time before it shows signs? Fors had a general idea about this ancient bronze cross. She then warily stored it away in a bag that contained all kinds of ritual materials.\nAfter doing this, Fors looked down at the silver bracelet on her wrist. She confirmed that it was completely empty and was without any accessories hanging from it.\nShe had used up all five stones that allowed her to use Teleport.\nHowever, Fors no longer felt as anxious as before. Although she believed that the \"full moon ravings\" would become clearer and more terrifying with the usage of each stone, she also knew that with Mr. Fool's help, this wasn't a problem. Over the past year, if not for her need to spend some time above the gray fog during every full moon or Blood Moon, she would've almost forgotten that she was suffering the torment from the \"full moon ravings.\"\nI hope that the curse will be lifted one day... After retracting her gaze from the dull silver bracelet, Fors couldn't help but sigh.\nShe then sincerely thanked Mr. Fool in her heart.\n...No matter what \"His\" real goal is, \"He\" has rescued me time and time again. It hasn't only been from the \"full moon ravings\"...\nThis cross's level doesn't seem low. I wonder if Mr. Fool will be interested and is willing to accept my sacrifice... I didn't have any good items or news to repay \"Him\" for his benevolence. I finally see an opportunity...\nUh... This is a common spoil of war. I only own half of it. I wonder if Mr. Fool is willing to accept a sacrifice that I only have half the rights to... No, Xio has also been rescued by Mr. Fool before...\nHehe, perhaps it might please Mr. Fool... If \"He\" is satisfied, he might produce a few Beyonder powers and allow me to record them in Leymano's Travels. No, Leymano's Travels might not be able to record a deity's powers. It won't be able to withstand Mr. Fool's powers... Hmm, the powers of the angels under \"Him\" will do too. No, no, no-I can't be too greedy. I'll be satisfied if Mr. World can demonstrate some of his powers for me to record...\nFors's thoughts wandered as she had expectations akin to a dream.\nThis was the instinct of a best-selling author.\nAs for why she didn't expect anything else other than the recording of Beyonder powers, it was because she realized today how important and terrifying Beyonder powers at the demigod level were.\nIf Leymano's Travels didn't have Hurricane recorded, she and Xio might not have been able to capture Viscount Stratford. They might not even succeed in escaping.\nEven if she didn't include the bronze cross, Viscount Stratford himself was a rather powerful Beyonder. If he hadn't been injured by Hurricane in the beginning and left dizzy from the fall, their sneak attacks might not have reached this level of success. There was a high chance that they might suffer a counterattack.\nOf course, separating the resplendent cross from Viscount Stratford was key to the victory of this brief battle tonight. And again, this was all thanks to Hurricane.\nOn careful thought, if we switched to a less pressing situation, and if the bronze cross and the demigod powers in the notebook were excluded, Xio and I might have a chance of defeating Viscount Stratford together. We might even have quite good odds...\nThe Beyonder powers recorded in the notebook are varied, and when put together, they're truly powerful. Together with Xio's Psychic Piercing and the effects of Wintry Blade, in a head-on battle, it's reasonable for Viscount Stratford to be defeated if he doesn't have any special mystical items.\nA living Scribe with rich experience is actually this powerful... The more Fors thought, the stranger she felt.\nShe realized that she had become rather formidable!\nBack when they were dealing with the ancient wraith, she had already come to a similar conclusion.\nAnd this time, their enemy, Viscount Stratford, was the captain of the royal guards of the Loen royal family. He was at least Sequence 6 and was probably Sequence 5. Furthermore, he wielded an item at the demigod level. The level of his strength was clear, so this immediately allowed Fors to benchmark her \"level\" in the world of Beyonders. Although their victory mainly stemmed from a sneak attack, a successful one was also a manifestation of one's strength.\nI'm already a Scribe. With a good combination of powers, together with Leymano's Travels, I'm already a rather strong Sequence 5... The only problem is that I lack experience... As Fors reflected poignantly, she cast her gaze at Xio and Viscount Stratford, continuing to listen to their questions and answers.\nAt this moment, Xio's question had already reached a rather key topic that could easily result in resistance.\n\"How did Mason Dere die?\"\nAfter asking this question, Xio's expression suddenly turned complicated and expectant. She was also in a dilemma, feeling pangs of excitement and fear.\nThis was a question she wished to ask eight years ago. In these nearly 3,000 days, she had been constantly searching for an answer, but she was also afraid that the answer wasn't something she expected. She was afraid that her father was really involved in a mutiny and thus was executed, marring his reputation.\nViscount Stratford didn't immediately answer Xio's question. He seemed to struggle before saying, \"He discovered His Majesty's secret and tried informing the three Churches but failed. He was executed on the spot.\"\nXio fell into a daze for a few seconds before finally confirming the answer she received.\nAlthough this answer shocked her, it made the heart in her mouth sink back to its original position as she calmed down.\n\"Secret... His Majesty's secret...\" she muttered softly to herself and asked in a pressing tone, \"What secret?\"\nFors, who was beside her, was also shocked to the point of being dumbfounded. She never expected things to develop to this stage.\nAt that moment, Viscount Stratford's facial muscles visibly contorted. It took him a great deal of effort to say a few words \uff1a\"That secret is...\"\nSuddenly, his body jerked violently. His confused eyes regained their luster.\nRight on the heels of that, his body collapsed from the most minute part, instantly transforming into a ball of \"fireworks.\"\nThe blood-red \"fireworks\" soared into the sky and exploded, illuminating the night sky as they were reflected in Fors's and Xio's eyes.\nThis... Having experienced this previously, Fors didn't waste any time after her eyes momentarily blanked out. She immediately crouched down and grabbed Shermane's corpse and Xio's calf.\nTheir figures swiftly turned transparent as they vanished from the spot, Teleporting to the southern area of the bridge.\nAbove the gray fog, Klein, who was holding the Sea God Scepter, saw the \"fireworks\" that stained the sky red.\nBack when Fors prayed to him, he had happened to be inside the magnificent palace observing Qonas Kilgor's actions. He conveniently took in the Red Priest card and used the paper figurine he cut, stirred the powers of the mysterious space, and gave a response.\nDuring this process, he discovered that the person lying next to Miss Magician and Miss Judgment was Viscount Stratford.\nThis was one of the targets he had placed great importance on. Although he hadn't investigated him personally, he knew that there was something wrong with him. He knew that Demoness Trissy was targeting him, so he had remembered his appearance and characteristics at a ball.\nKlein didn't know what the two Tarot Club members were up to, but since it involved Viscount Stratford, he definitely didn't write off its importance. He directly observed what subsequently happened to Miss Magician and Miss Judgment through the crimson stars.\nAfter advancing to a demigod and obtaining even more authorities, he didn't need the Tarot Club members to pray to directly observe their vicinity via the crimson star. This was similar to specially marking out believers, but Klein had always held great restraint towards that and had never attempted it.\nThis made him hear Xio's and Viscount Stratford's conversation.\nAnd since he knew the underlying truth, he knew very well what the true meaning and importance of \"who he was loyal to\" was.\nCombined with the discovery of the king's secret by the former captain of the royal guards, Mason Dere, and how his attempt to inform the three Churches failed, Klein already had a guess.\nHe suspected that the greatest culprit behind the Great Smog of Backlund was the Loen Kingdom's king, George III!"}
{"num_chp":551,"summary":"\"Second Commandment: Thou shalt not use my name in vain.\n\"Third Commandment: Thou shalt have no other gods before me.\n\"Fourth Commandment: Honor thy father, thy mother, and thy children as you love me.\n\"Fifth Commandment: Thou shalt not commit adultery.\n\"Sixth Commandment: Thou shalt not kill the innocent.\n\"Seventh Commandment: Thou shalt not bear false witness, frame, or violate contracts.\n\"Eighth Commandment: Serve me with your heart, not with your offerings.\n\"Ninth Commandment: Those who have committed lesser wrongdoings, first atone for your sins before seeking forgiveness.\n\"Tenth Commandment: Honor my name by helping your compatriots and companions.\"\nOne commandment after another echoed in the ears of the bald rebel, Kalat, causing him to completely prostrate himself. He held his head close to the ground, uncontrollably trembling slightly with reverence, fear, and excitement.\nAs a Mid-Sequence Beyonder, a rebel who had once been educated in the Feysac Empire, he had sufficient insight to understand that the worship of the Sea God was based more on fear-fear of powerful forces, fear of the fearsome natural risks that mankind faced, and many rituals that retained primitive bloodshed, a backward faith that reveled in inhumane and uncivilized practices, something that would be eliminated sooner or later.\nHowever, the faith he had developed since he was young had made him afraid to go against the divine revelation. He could only bury the idea of modifying the ritual process deep in his heart and avoid the parts which conflicted with his own wishes as much as possible.\nNow, the Sea God's sudden change left him extremely delighted. It was as if he could see the so-called \"primitive totem,\" that outsiders claimed it to be, evolving into a true god.\nBlessed are we; blessed are the rebels; blessed are the true believers...In his blurred vision, Kalat raised his head, spread his hands sincerely, and placed them against his mouth.\n\"I will abide by your teachings as if I am praising your name.\"\nThe blurry figure in front of him disappeared, the magnificent voice by his ears vanished, and the scene in the cave returned to its original state.\nHowever, Kalat knew that everything was no longer the same.\nHe moved his elbows several times and quickly crawled back to his wheelchair. He once again sat on it and turned to the other side of the cave.\nKalat quickly met with Edmonton. This member of the Resistance with a blue sea serpent tattoo was standing in front of the deity figurine that was bleeding abnormally. His forehead was a mix of scarlet red and black, dirty and gruesome.\nHowever, Edmonton's expression was joyful, excited, and satisfied. He looked at Kalat and blurted out, \"Did you receive the revelation?\"\n\"Yes, it's the aura of God, just like before.\" Kalat nodded in excitement. \"Not only has God rebuilt the earth, but \u2018He' has also rebuilt his covenant.\"\nEdmonton let out a sigh of relief.\n\"I was even suspecting that I was hallucinating before.\n\"It seems like as long as an outsider touches the holy sword, God will be able to walk the land again. There's no need for it to be completely lifted.\"\nKalat chimed, \"Indeed. The reason why the deity figurine shattered and bled is because God has changed \u2018His' image. We must build a new one! Just like the scenes we saw earlier!\"\n\"God also showed his Sacred Emblem. Above the symbol of the waves, there was a scepter in the shape of lightning, surrounded by strong winds,\" Edmonton said as he recalled.\nKalat immediately patted the armrest of his wheelchair.\n\"Let's find the High Priest right now. He should've also received the revelation.\n\"We will usher in a new world!\"\n...\nAbove the gray fog, Klein put down the Sea God's Scepter and rubbed his temples in exhaustion.\nHe had noticed a problem earlier. The Sea God Scepter could respond to ritualistic magic, which meant that it could provide a certain amount of strength to help the worshiper complete the ritual and achieve their goals. However, it could only be concentrated within his domain and could not exceed the limit. Whatever could be done was relatively limited.\nFor example, the Evernight Goddess could use a method of influencing fate to let \"Her\" believers naturally obtain the money they needed and pay their debt. As for the Sea God Scepter, it could at most produce fake money on the altar, and after a while, it would become ineffective and return to its true form.\nThis is the difference between a false god and a true god...\nBesides, apart from the gray fog, as long as it fulfills the procedure and prayer, the Sea God Scepter is capable of automatically responding to ritualistic magic, unless it will use up more than half of its power in one go... This might be why the steps to ritualistic magic are extremely important...\nAbove the gray fog, prayers will be screened, reduced to points of light. The Sea God Scepter is unable to automatically respond; hence, requiring me to manually handle them. This makes it relatively troublesome. It's impossible for me to stay here all day. Of course, there's also a benefit to it-as long as the prayer doesn't have any mistakes, and it is accurately pointed towards the Sea God Scepter, regardless of how perfunctory the ritual is, they will be able to receive a response. The only criteria is that I'm in a good mood...\nI'll think of a solution when I'm free. I'll make it so that even if the Sea God Scepter is above the gray fog, it will be an automated answering machine... Produce a paper angel? That's useless, as it doesn't have any soul injected into it... Make a mechanical and rigid puppet to handle the repeated and trivial ritualistic magic? Hmm... I wonder if a Nimblewright Master has powers related to this. At the very least, Rosago only showed traits of controlling a person like a puppet...\nAs Klein's thoughts slowly settled, his eyes moved to the iron cigar case.\nAfter some research, he discovered that this cigarette case that had a severely corroded exterior had undergone some abnormal changes. It was firmer, tougher, and more resistant to corrosion. However, it was still within a comprehensible and acceptable range of normal humans.\nIt isn't equipped with any special properties... However, if it were placed here for a few years, decades, or even longer where it holds Beyonder characteristics and mystical items, perhaps it could really evolve into a \"sealing case\" whose effects would gradually fade one day...The corner of Klein's mouth twitched, and he turned his head to look at the junk pile in the corner.\nThey were covered by the gray fog, almost blending in with the surroundings.\nHeh heh...Klein laughed dryly and looked away.\nHe fiddled with the crushed golden wine cup again, confirming that there was nothing wrong with it.\nAfter doing all this, he entered the real world and summoned himself once more to bring the Sun Brooch and other items back to his room in the inn.\nAt this very moment, the clouds in the sky had disappeared, and the moon was scattering its crimson tranquility. The entire City of Generosity, Bayam, remained asleep in its dreams.\n...\n9 a.m., Cathedral of Waves.\nAlger was summoned, and by using the excuse of a confession, he once again met the diocese bishop, Chogo.\n\"Look for this person.\" Chogo handed over the portrait in his hand.\nAnother mission... What's going on recently?Alger muttered in his mind as he unfolded the piece of paper.\nWhen he saw the contents of the portrait, he almost couldn't control his laughter.\nIt was impossible to tell if the figure in the portrait was male or female, or what they looked like. How was he supposed to find them? In a split second, he thought of something and didn't try to hide his change in mood. Instead, he deliberately blurted out, \"Who is this?\"\nThe portrait depicted an unusually blurry and mysterious person, with no characteristics that could be used to aid in a search.\nThere was no such mission yesterday... A sudden demand to pursue this person this morning... What happened last night? Hmm, Kalvetua perished completely... With that happening, the Church and the military would definitely search for its remains... Symeem Island is the clue? This person took away the most important item ahead of them? Who is this person?Alger's heart skipped a beat, and he almost didn't dare meet Chogo's eyes.\nChogo nodded.\n\"A dirty, despicable thief! He may be from Intis or Feysac, and he may belong to the Church of the Eternal Blazing Sun or the Church of the God of Combat.\"\nSomeone from Intis or Feysac, or someone from the Church of the Eternal Blazing Sun or the Church of the God of Combat? Why would there be such a guess and conclusion? His Eminence Jahn Kottman only received little information at the scene and was unable to pinpoint the target? In this case, it's indeed possible to presume that this person is from either Intis or Feysac, as the main supporters of the Resistance and Kalvetua are from those two countries. Heh heh, there is reason to believe that they may have already known where Kalvetua was hiding... It fits my theory from before... Of course, it could also be something else...Alger controlled his emotions and asked, \"What did he do?\"\n\"You don't need to know. Just pay attention to any abnormalities from people from Intis or Feysac in Bayam. Yes, also include the locals who have become Beyonders. Also, find the people who previously posted the notice on the front door of the cathedral. They might know something, and they could quickly give you further information,\" George ordered in a deep voice.\nThis is indeed a direction... This is tantamount to telling me that this person has something to do with the notice and the perishing of Kalvetua... I wonder whose hands Kalvetua's Beyonder characteristic landed in... Who.... Right, The World is in Bayam. Something happened to Kalvetua not long after he came here! Could this be Mr. Fool's purpose? Would this help him in the process of removing the seal and regaining his strength?Alger's pupils contracted as he recalled his conjecture from a while ago.\n...\nWhen he woke up, Klein, who had reaped a bountiful harvest last night, was uplifted and in a good mood.\nHe decided to treat himself today and make sure that his three meals would be sumptuous and delicious.\nAs he pushed open the door and walked into the living room, he saw that Danitz was out of \"bed,\" untying the bandage and splint around his arm.\nHe recovered that quickly?Klein was stunned for a moment.\nSeeing Gehrman Sparrow look over, Danitz chuckled and said, \"My ability at recovering isn't too bad. My Sequence 9 is called Hunter. I received a clear improvement in various aspects of my body, allowing me to surpass ordinary humans. When it comes to combat, I experienced a great enhancement. Besides, I'm already at Sequence 7.\"\nSequence 9 Hunter? I've killed one, and I know the corresponding Sequence 6's name is Conspiracist...Klein suddenly recalled the first enemy he encountered back when he first arrived in Backlund. It had sucked him into a maelstrom that he was almost unable to extricate himself from.\n\"Sequence 8, Provoker?\" Klein asked in passing.\nHe had long since guessed Danitz's Beyonder pathway from his adeptness at using fire. It was the Red Priest pathway which Roselle had called a true man. Sequence 7 was called the Pyromaniac, also known in ancient times as Fire Mage.\nDanitz froze for a second, thinking that Gehrman Sparrow was doubting him. He subconsciously raised his voice.\n\"Do you think I'm not good at provoking?\n\"No, I'm an expert in this field!\""}
{"num_chp":853,"summary":"What do I think? If I were to know the answer, why would I be here? I'd have long handed this information to my superiors!Leonard silently mumbled as he deliberated over his words.\nDuring this process, he discovered that, although he was standing straight and looking down on Dwayne Dant\u00e8s, the tycoon who was sitting leisurely in the reclining chair held the aura of having the advantage. It was like a high-ranking personage casually listening to his subordinate's reports.\nThis made Leonard feel a little uneasy. He subconsciously surveyed the area and pulled a chair over as he leaned back into it, half out of habit and half as a deliberate action.\n\"I believe he, or all of you are searching for something.\n\"Back in Tingen, he infiltrated the Nighthawks to search for something. In Backlund, he also infiltrated Chanis Gate to search for that item!\n\"His search was fruitless the first time, so he escaped by feigning death by using Ince Zangwill's assault.\n\"He still failed to find it the second time. Hence, he didn't take anything and directly left Chanis Gate!\"\nWhile speaking, Leonard used a very certain tone to divulge that he had figured out that Gehrman Sparrow was Sherlock Moriarty and also Klein Moretti. He wished to use the effect of pressure to make Dwayne Dant\u00e8s not appear that calm or have any thoughts of resorting to sophistry.\nIndeed, he went to dig my grave...Klein sighed inwardly as he chuckled. He picked up the glass of red wine and gently swirled it.\n\"Do you think that we would consecutively make two rash attempts before having any confirmed intelligence? You should know that such matters can only be done once. Once there's a failure, there's no way it can succeed again.\n\"Therefore, who would use an operation to verify one's guess when the target isn't clear?\"\nHe has tacitly confirmed my explanation. Klein Moretti is Gehrman Sparrow, Hero Bandit Black Emperor, a member of the secret organization who believes in The Fool...Leonard tried hard not to frown as he crossed his right leg and said, \"So, it's not that nothing was found, but that there was a failure due to other factors?\n\"During these two attempts, Tingen City's Saint Selena Cathedral and Backlund's Saint Samuel Cathedral only shared two common items: Sealed Artifact 2-049 and the Antigonus family's notebook.\n\"Antigonus family's notebook... That's it? Klein Moretti joined the Nighthawks because of it!\"\nAlthough the process of inference is wrong, the answer is actually correct...Klein chuckled and said, \"Our brains aren't there just for show.\n\"If his goal was the Antigonus family's notebook, there was no need for him to join the Nighthawks. Before you obtained it, he had plenty of opportunities.\n\"And even after you obtained it, he had no lack of opportunities to obtain it. You should understand the situation back then better than I do.\n\"Also, since the target was the Antigonus family's notebook, why didn't he take it away?\"\nUpon being mocked by Dwayne Dant\u00e8s, Leonard Mitchell realized that the theory he came up with on the spot was filled with logical contradictions. He felt ashamed as he showed some anger.\nHe slowly took a deep breath and said, \"Then why would he infiltrate Chanis Gate using two different methods? And not only didn't he take something away, but he didn't even leave anything behind. He even entered a strange state.\"\nJust as Leonard said that, he saw Dwayne Dant\u00e8s with his gray sideburns produce a deep, profound smile.\n\"I'm not sure of the reason for the latter matters. Perhaps you should ask the Evernight Goddess.\"\nGoddess... What does he mean?Leonard instantly felt alarmed and puzzled. He found it unimaginable as to what had happened behind Saint Samuel Cathedral's Chanis Gate.\nRight on the heels of that, he heard Dwayne Dant\u00e8s say with a deep laugh, \"As for your first question, I believe you are mistaken about something.\n\"Our organization's members come from different places and join for different reasons, choosing to change their own faith in the process. As for what happened before that, their lives remain their own.\n\"Just like me. I had a past and have a present as well. The reason why I came here is because of the last name I gave myself.\"\nDant\u00e8s... The Return of the Count... He joined the secret organization that worships The Fool for revenge, and came to Backlund?Leonard nodded in thought.\nKlein paused for a few seconds as he casually sipped the red wine and wore a smile. He continued, \"Similarly, he, who was resurrected because of the Antigonus family's notebook's curse, does it for vengeance as well.\"\nKlein had deliberately mentioned his present last name, Dant\u00e8s, and mentioned revenge. It was to preemptively distinguish himself from Gehrman Sparrow and Klein Moretti. It was to prevent Leonard from later finding similar objectives between the two and begin making a deeper connection from the similarities.\nBy personally mentioning it, it framed the listener's thought processes and made them subconsciously follow the logic of the content; thus, treating Dwayne Dant\u00e8s and Klein Moretti as two completely different people. The only similarity was their thoughts of revenge. And in this world, there weren't only two avengers.\nLeonard lowered his crossed right leg unknowingly as he leaned forward.\n\"Vengeance?\n\"Who does he wish to seek revenge on?\"\nAfter asking the question, the elegant and handsome middle-aged gentleman curled the corners of his lips.\n\"Lanevus and...\n\"Ince Zangwill.\"\n\"Ince Zangwill...\" Leonard blurted out as he couldn't help but have his expression repeatedly change. Finally, he fell silent.\nHis green eyes looked ahead, unfocused; his thoughts a mystery.\nPhew...After a long silence, Leonard exhaled and released his originally clenched hands.\nHe asked with his voice a little hoarse, \"Lanevus was really killed by him?\"\n\"Of course,\" Klein secretly sighed as he replied calmly.\nLeonard's mouth gaped open as though he wished to say something, but he didn't. He tightly pursed his lips.\nRealizing that his goals had been met, he immediately changed topics and chuckled.\n\"If you have a similar goal or require help, you can also chant \u2018His' honorific name. Perhaps you will receive a response.\"\n\"He\"... That secret existence, The Fool?Leonard imagined that Dwayne Dant\u00e8s was habitually proselytizing and attempting to develop the secret organization. Therefore, he didn't think further and replied with silence.\nKlein then laughed.\n\"By the way, help me pass a message to Pallez Zoroast. One of our organization's members encountered Blasphemer Amon in the Forsaken Land of the Gods.\"\nThis piece of information contained massive amounts of information, so much that Leonard was temporarily at a loss for a response. His mind kept reverberating with the relevant information.\nThe Forsaken Land of the Gods? The Forsaken Land of the Gods that even the seven Churches are unable to find? Their secret organization actually has members who can enter the Forsaken Land of the Gods!\nBlasphemer Amon... Old Man told me that he's hiding from a High-Sequence Beyonder with the last name Amon. He was heavily injured by Amon and had no choice but to parasitize me...\nDwayne Dant\u00e8s's tone and attitude really is like an undying monster who lived from the Fourth Epoch. He's also at the same or a similar level as Old Man... In front of him, I really don't feel any sense of superiority. I even feel like I'm lacking confidence...\nAs his thoughts ran through his head, Leonard forced himself to focus.\n\"I'll pass on the message to him.\"\nHmm, based on the circumstances after Leonard enters the dreams of others, it can be determined that the grandpa doesn't completely control his senses. Otherwise, he would definitely have an abnormal reaction when he hears the name Blasphemer Amon... Previously, Will Auceptin's words also corroborates this point. Only when my dear poet encounters true danger would the grandpa sense it and take action... Very good. \"He\" isn't a full Parasite...As Klein interpreted the unspoken information, he smiled.\n\"You may leave. You can also relax. My goal isn't the Church of Evernight.\"\nMy coming goals, not the ones of the past...Klein silently added inwardly.\nLeonard had already received enough information; thus, he didn't dare overstay his welcome. He got up and bowed.\nThen, he left Dwayne Dant\u00e8s's dream.\n...\nIn a room on the back streets of Saint Samuel Cathedral, Leonard woke up and heard the aged voice from the Parasite in him echo in his mind:\n\"What did he say?\"\nLeonard deliberated over his words and said, \"He directly admitted to being a member of that secret organization that believes in The Fool. Likewise for Klein Moretti whose alias is Gehrman Sparrow.\n\"Their goal is for vengeance, their own vengeance.\"\nPallez Zoroast fell silent for a second before saying,\"Did he say how Klein Moretti could be resurrected? Or how did he fake his death to such an extent?\"\nLeonard recalled and said, \"The explanation he gave was a curse from the Antigonus family's notebook.\"\nCurse...At this point, Leonard discovered that Dwayne Dant\u00e8s's choice of words was rather strange.\nHe had described the power of resurrecting the dead as a curse!\nPallez Zoroast didn't seem to have any questions about that. After a few seconds of silence, he said,\"What else did he say?\"\nLeonard didn't hide it from him and said frankly, \"He mentioned Blasphemer Amon, saying that a member of their organization met him in the Forsaken Land of the Gods.\n\"Old Man, is that the Amon you mentioned?\"\nThe aged voice replied after a while,\"Probably.\"\nHe paused for a moment before saying,\"I believe that Dwayne Dant\u00e8s, no-The Fool that's backing him, might be some old friend of mine...\"\nOld Man believes that he's at a higher level than Dwayne Dant\u00e8s, or even higher... He's a Grounded Angel?Leonard thought and asked, \"Which old friend?\"\nPallez Zoroast didn't answer as he asked,\"Are you going to find an opportunity to reveal the situation about Dwayne Dant\u00e8s and Klein Moretti?\"\nLeonard suddenly fell silent and only heavily said more than ten seconds later, \"Not for now.\n\"Perhaps he and I, and them, have the chance of working together...\n\"And the Church didn't suffer any material loss this time.\"\nThe Parasite inside him didn't say a word, as though he had fallen asleep.\nLeonard slowly looked up and read the information in front of him. His eyes turned dark as he muttered, \"He's overtaken me by leaps and bounds...\""}
{"num_chp":997,"summary":"The core rules of Texas Hold'em were very simple. It was to use two hole cards and five community cards to form a hand with any five-card combination. Whoever had the biggest hand won. And the community cards were dealt in three phases. Three community cards to form \"the flop\" in the first phase, a fourth community card called \"the turn\" in the second phase, and a fifth community card called \"the river\" in the third phase. Each phase allowed players to fold, check, call, or raise. This continued until everyone was done or until one person didn't fold.\nKlein fiddled with the chip in his hand as he divined the existence of any lucky instances within the next few rounds. However, he was unable to tell which exact round it was. After all, it was only a quick and simple divination with average effects.\nUsing this method to play with ordinary people and Low-Sequence Beyonders wouldn't be a problem as long as the correct strategy is used, but it's definitely inadequate against demigods. It's already quite a challenge to defeat a Mid-Sequence Beyonder... Must I close my eyes each round and do a complete dream divination? Heh heh, if that were the case, Dwayne Dant\u00e8s might end up with the title \"Sleeping Gambling God\"...Klein sighed inwardly. He continued watching the round play out as he sat by the side. At present, he had already lost a bigblind1and a smallblind2when it was his turn.\nAt this moment, Klein noticed one point: The MI9 deputy director, Qonas Kilgor, had lost 20 pounds to Admiral Amyrius.\nA successful Bribe... Admiral Amyrius should be able to tell that Qonas is using his powers as a Baron of Corruption, but he might not know that this MI9 deputy director is a demigod... The next round will be interesting... Hehe...\nKlein jolted to attention as the new round began. He didn't check his hole cards when the croupier handed him two new ones. Instead, he placed the metal chip he was playing with in his hand onto his hole card, taking on the stance of not planning to look at them.\nAfter two people folded, the stern and old-fashioned Amyrius Rieveldt casually took a look at his hole cards. After counting five pounds worth of chips, he threw it into the middle of the table, having raised the stakes without garnering any surprises.\nAnother person folded as Macht called. Right on the heels of that, Qonas Kilgor, who had an unyielding personality, raised the stakes, throwing out a total of 20 pounds.\nCalvin confirmed his hole cards once again before calling.\nAfter one last person folded, Dwayne Dant\u00e8s didn't do an actual count. He grabbed a handful of chips and threw it out.\nThe croupier who was in charge of counting the chips glanced at it before precisely announcing Dwayne's action, \"20 pounds. Call.\"\n\"I thought it would be 50 pounds. From the looks of it, I'm still not very used to these chips,\" the white-sideburned Dwayne Dant\u00e8s with an outstanding temperament said with a laugh.\nHowever, he didn't add on the additional 30 pounds.\nAt this moment, no one made a move. It was Amyrius Rieveldt's turn again.\nThis admiral didn't even glance at the remaining players. Picking up five ten-pound chips, he threw them out.\n\"Another raise.\"\nHe didn't show any perturbations in his emotions, acting as though he was ordering a cup of black tea. However, that indescribable sense of dominance and the act of repeatedly raising the stakes pre-flop made the mood at the table freeze.\nSuch situations often implied that Admiral Amyrius had excellent hole cards. Perhaps they were a pair of Aces or a pair of Kings, or an Ace and King.\nMacht decided to fold. Qonas Kilgor rubbed his high nose bridge and glanced around with his dark blue eyes before saying, \"Call.\"\nColonel Calvin confirmed his cards again. After ten seconds of hesitation, he chose to fold.\nDwayne Dant\u00e8s touched the metal chip on his two hole cards and smiled.\n\"Call.\"\nAfter a round of expressing their intentions, there were only three players for the round. Then, the croupier flipped the three community cards in the middle of the table for the flop.\n\"2\u2660, 9\u2665, K\u2660.\"\nThe person who was up first was Admiral Amyrius Rieveldt. He leaned forward slightly and said in a domineering manner, \"50 pounds.\"\nHe had immediately raised the stakes to 50 pounds!\nMacht, Calvin, and company, including those who weren't in the game, felt stifled for some baffling reason.\n\"...\" Qonas Kilgor trembled slightly, but he ultimately grabbed 50 pounds and threw it out.\nDwayne Dant\u00e8s glanced at the deputy director of MI9. Completely unfazed by the pressure, he said with a smile, \"Call.\"\nUpon hearing this, Calvin turned his head and nodded at Dwayne Dant\u00e8s with his deep blue eyes that resembled a nighttime lake, indicating his approval.\nFrom his point of view, Admiral Amyrius's domineering stance didn't affect a person who came to lose money.\nAt this moment, the red-vested croupier revealed the fourth card-the turn.\n\"9\u2660.\"\nThere were three Spades, increasing the chances of a flush tremendously. However, Admiral Amyrius still didn't hesitate. He calmly pushed a stack of chips.\n\"100 pounds.\"\nQonas Kilgor's fingers tapped on his hole cards, showing his lack of confidence. But ultimately, he choose to call.\nDwayne Dant\u00e8s glanced at this deputy director once again and maintained his warm smile.\n\"Call.\"\nAt this point in time, he had yet to see his hole cards, making Calvin somewhat worried. He believed that such an act was going overboard-a clear act of throwing money away. It wasn't something Admiral Amyrius, who was relatively conservative, might find acceptable.\nAt this moment, the red-vested croupier revealed the final card-the river:\n\"2\u2663.\"\nAs such, the community cards took form:\n\"2\u2660, 9\u2665, K\u2660, 9\u2660, 2\u2663.\"\n\"200 pounds.\" Admiral Amyrius pushed a pile of metal chips in with an extremely domineering attitude.\nQonas Kilgor took a deep breath before pushing two stacks of chips.\n\"500 pounds.\"\nThis amount of money was half of his purported annual salary.\nIs he trying to bluff?Calvin and Macht exchanged looks, believing that Brigadier General Kilgor had made it too obvious, making it easy to see through him.\nOne had to know that when playing Texas Hold'em, apart from doing risk management and probability calculations, it also involved psychological battles most of the time. Be it in terms of body language, expression, or the style used for raises, they made it easy to expose one's hidden cards.\nOf course, good players could also use these details to deliberately misdirect their opponents.\nDwayne Dant\u00e8s sized up Qonas Kilgor before he laughed. Then, like the previous few times, he said, \"Call.\"\nAmyrius raised his hands, prepared to push all his remaining chips, to pressure his opponents into folding.\nAt this moment, he suddenly paused. His deadpan expression wore a look of solemnity.\nAfter a few seconds of silence, he calmly said, \"Call.\"\nAt this point, the hole cards could be revealed to compare each person's hand.\nAdmiral Amyrius flipped his card first. It was an A\u2660 and 10\u2660. It formed a flush with the 2\u2660, K\u2660, and 9\u2660. It was a rather high-ranking hand, with the only ones bigger than it being a full house, four of a kind, straight flush, and royal flush.\n\"It's your turn,\" Amyrius then urged Qonas.\nQonas first flipped open a single card-K\u2666. It made two pairs with the K and 9 from the community cards.\nFollowing that, he picked up his second hole card. At that moment, the remaining poker cards at the red-vested croupier's end blurred.\nPa!\nThe hole card was flipped open, revealing itself: \"9\u2663!\"\n\"What?\" Macht and company exclaimed, hardly believing their eyes.\nThis meant that Qonas Kilgor had obtained a full house-nines over kings!\nIt was bigger than a flush!\n\"Sorry about that. Full house,\" Qonas looked at Amyrius and said with a smile.\nThen, he turned to look at Dwayne Dant\u00e8s.\n\"You can reveal your cards.\"\n\"I'm also very curious as to what my cards are.\" Dwayne Dant\u00e8s smiled. He picked up the metal chip that he had placed down on his cards and very casually flipped the two hole cards.\n\"Eh...\"\n\"What?\"\n...\nCalvin and company rubbed their eyes.\nDwayne Dant\u00e8s's hole cards were a very weak pair: \"2\u2665, 2\u2666.\"\nThere happened to be a very small pair in the community cards: \"2\u2660, 2\u2663.\"\nThey formed a four of a kind-the smallest rank when it came to four of a kind, but it was higher ranked than all the full houses!\n\"Praise the Lady!\" Dwayne Dant\u00e8s drew the crimson moon across his chest in pleasant surprise, looking as though he had never expected it.\n\"An interesting round.\" Amyrius was taken aback for a moment before he gently clapped.\nQonas Kilgor gave Dwayne Dant\u00e8s a deep look and said with a laughing sigh, \"I never expected the final winner to be you.\"\nKlein wiped the smile from his face as he inwardly grumbled,It's only right that I win over the two of you. On the one hand, Admiral Amyrius enjoys pressuring others and doesn't really rely on his Beyonder powers to cheat. As for you, you placed your focus and Beyonder powers on Admiral Amyrius; thus, ignoring me. On the other hand, the one playing cards with you is actually named Winner Enuni.\nWithout even looking at his hole cards, it was obvious that he was relying solely on luck!\nAt the moment he placed his chip on the hole cards, Klein had already swapped positions with Enuni as they switched faces with each other!\nAlthough Colonel Calvin had gotten him to deliberately lose 1,000 pounds, Klein decided to win a killing after he saw Qonas Kilgor.\nThis wasn't because he couldn't bear to part with the money; instead, his main motive was to garner the attention of this MI9 demigod. He wanted to get familiar with him and build relationships!\nOnly by doing this could Klein have an opportunity to obtain intelligence from Qonas Kilgor and even carry out an assault on him. After all, he was a demigod. To deal with him in Backlund required sufficient care and caution. He would rather give up an operation if he lacked the confidence to guarantee a kill or lure him away from Backlund. Otherwise, he was bound to expose himself, ending up being surrounded by demigods and even angels in Backlund.\nIn the subsequent rounds, Klein won and lost different rounds. In the end, not only did he keep his 1,000 pounds in chips, but he had even won nearly an additional 1,000 pounds. During this process, Calvin had gestured to Dwayne Dant\u00e8s to lose, but he was left stupefied by the latter's ridiculous good luck that left him undefeatable.\nAfter the game came to an end, a person walked over to Dwayne Dant\u00e8s with a smile-Qonas Kilgor.\n----------------------\n1 \"big blind\" is equal to the minimum bet.\n2 The \"small blind\" is normally half the big blind."}
{"num_chp":108,"summary":"Despite not being dawn yet, the well-ventilated but quiet and dark underground was illuminated by gas lamps. The dim yellow light emitted from the gas lamps were protected by glass, allowing them to steadily shine throughout the empty and quiet tunnel.\nKlein sat in the duty room and casually flipped through the newspapers, magazines, and books piled before him. He directed some of his attention outside, to prevent anyone from charging inside the Chanis Gate.\nHis windbreaker and top hat were hung on the clothes rack near the entrance while his cane was leaning against the wall where it could be easily retrieved.\nThe rich aroma of coffee filled the air, and Klein couldn't help but take a whiff. He massaged his temples to fight against the heavy head feeling he was experiencing and the weariness of his body.\nAs a college student back on Earth, he often slept at five in the morning and woke up at noon, while staying up all night during the past two to three years of working life, to the point of being able to attend work energetically the next day. However, it was all thanks to the games that were too exhilarating, novels that were too interesting, television shows and movies that were too entertaining.\nThis world obviously didn't possess any of the necessities needed for staying up all night.\n\"Seriously, Emperor Roselle. If you want to posture, do it properly. Pour your limited life into an unlimited enterprise. Lead the people of this world into the information age!\" Klein muttered silently. He could only console himself that there were at least newspapers, magazines, and increasingly interesting novels.\nAt first, he wanted to focus on his studies to restrain his sleepiness. However, practically speaking, it conflicted with his duty. Once he entered that state, he would easily overlook any movements outside and any changes to the situation at the Chanis Gate.\nPhew.Klein picked up his coffee cup and carefully blew at it.\nHe took a sip and let the fragrant taste swish around his mouth before letting the liquid slowly flow down his throat.\n\"Fermo Coffee from the Paz Valley, very bitter but very refreshing,\" Klein gave a compliment and put down his coffee cup.\nThe Paz Valley was located in the Southern Continent, a region that produced high-quality coffee beans. It was currently being fought over by the Intis Republic and the Loen Kingdom. They both built colonist settlements on the left and right banks of the Paz Valley, and had destroyed the original Paz Kingdom.\nIn the eerie silence, Klein casually picked up a magazine and realized that it was Ladies Aesthetic, which talked about fashion and dating.\n\"This must be from Rozanne...\" he murmured in amusement as he flipped through it with his interest piqued.\nMaybe it was due to the sudden advancement of camera technology in the past decade or so, not only did the magazine use a lot of illustrations, it even used monochrome pictures as their content-just like the newspapers.\nThey fashionably invited the famous play and musical actors to model the charms and the magical pairing of the clothing. In a short span of seven years, the new regional Backlund magazine became a mainstream magazine that spread across the nation.\n\"The dress looks nice, she's pretty too...\" Klein flipped through it casually and didn't hide his aesthetic inclinations.\nHe was a man that had matured normally both in body and mind. He had always appreciated beautiful ladies, but he had long set his goal-to find a way home. Hence, he tried his best to keep his distance from the opposite sex, so that he didn't waste the other person's time or leave behind any emotional baggage.\nAs for streetwalkers, he was quite a germaphobe in that aspect.\nBenson and Melissa were already shackles that couldn't be removed. He could only find the means to make it up to them in the future... Klein suddenly felt his heart heavy and he couldn't help but let out a sigh.\nThe further he strayed away from home, the more he felt melancholic during quiet late nights.\nHe suddenly lost his interest in looking at beautiful women and put down the magazine in his hands. He picked up a novel instead.\n\"Stormwind Mountain Villa, author, Fors Wall,\" Klein read the content on the cover.\nThe tranquil night, dim yellow light, and the leatherbound book reminded him of his younger days when he rented books. Hence, he continued to read simply because of nostalgia.\nStormwind Mountain Villa was a novel about Lady Sissi, who was 1.65 meters tall and weighed ninety-eight pounds. It was a story of her embarking as a home tutor in the Fruys Mountain Villa.\n\"One pound is about half a kilogram... Is this Jane Eyre of an alternate world?\" Klein caressed his fingers against the smooth paper as he began making guesses of the subsequent content.\nHowever, just as he thought it was a romance novel, an evil spirit emerged in the story. When he believed that it was a ghost story, Lady Sissi revealed herself as a detective and made a marvelous deduction.\nJust as Klein felt that it was definitely a detective novel, the main male character took a heavy blow to the head and lost his memory. Then, it became a heart-rending drama.\n\"... In the end, it's still a romance book.\" Klein closed the book and drank a mouthful of coffee.\nThump!\nThump! Thump! Thump!\nA ferocious knocking was suddenly heard as it reverberated in the dim and quiet empty corridor.\nKlein jumped in shock as he immediately turned tense.\nHe instinctively drew his revolver from his armpit holster, adjusted the cylinder and hammer. Then, he slowly walked to the door and looked for the source of the sound.\nThump! Thump! Thump!\nBang! Bang! Bang!\nThe thumping became more and more intense. Klein looked in the direction of the sound and saw the black outward-swinging gates that were engraved with seven Sacred Emblems.\n\"Sounds from beyond the Chanis Gate?\" He squinted his eyes and his heart was beating like a drum.\nBang! Bang! Bang!\nKlein saw Chanis Gate shake gently, and he sensed the massive impact it was withstanding.\n\"It can't be, right... I'm encountering something on my first day on duty? Did I get an unlucky constitution after I transmigrated?\" Klein's right hand broke into cold sweat as it held the revolver.\nVery soon, he recalled the Captain's instruction: do not open Chanis Gate no matter what you hear, unless it is opened from the inside.\nUh, could this be a normal phenomenon?Klein suddenly calmed down.\nBang! Bang! Bang! Thump! Thump! Thump!The commotion beyond the Chanis Gate grew in intensity, but the heavy black metal gates only shook. Otherwise, it didn't show any unusual signs.\n\"This is normal. I nearly died from the shock...\" Klein muttered, before he prepared to return to the duty room.\nJust then, he heard a sharp grinding noise. He looked at the heavy Chanis Gate bulging outwards as a crack appeared on in its surface!\nZing!\nIn the jarring noise, Klein's almost fixed eyes saw a figure. Its height was about the length of a man's arm, and it was wearing a classic, black, miniaturized regal gown. There was an obvious stain on the gown.\nIt had a not-so-exquisite face, black eyes, and tightly sealed lips.\nIt was a cloth puppet, a toy cloth puppet!\nAt that moment, when Klein was about to subconsciously raised his gun to take aim, the cloth puppet leaned heavily into the crack in Chanis Gate and unfurled the paper it was holding.\nThere were many mysterious symbols on the paper, some that Klein knew and some that he had yet to learn. Together, they formed a vertical eye!\nKlein had yet to understand the situation when the regal-gowned puppet was suddenly dragged back by a shapeless force to the back of Chanis Gate!\nCreak!\nChanis Gate closed once again, with no more knocking or pounding sounds.\nThe basement regained its tranquility and silence as though nothing had happened.\n\"I have to inform Captain that Chanis Gate was opened from the inside... But it closed itself...\" At that moment, Klein's mental facilities returned to him as he felt alarm, fear, and doubt.\nA few seconds later, he recalled what the cloth puppet was. Since he was an official member of the Nighthawks, he was given the clearance to know about the Grade 3 Sealed Artifact sealed behind Chanis Gate.\n\"Number: 0625.\n\"Name: Misfortune Cloth Puppet.\n\"Danger Grade: 3. Considerably dangerous. It has to be used carefully. It can only be applied for operations that require three or more people.\n\"Security classification: Official Nighthawk member or above.\n\"Sealing method: Only needs to be separated from humans.\n\"Description: The cloth puppet is wearing a regal gown which was popular in around the year 1300. The gown has a stain that is almost impossible to remove. It is uncertain if the stain was present from the very beginning.\n\"In a few tragic cases of individual family financial crises recorded in Tingen, the police noticed the existence of the puppet. It was always placed in the children's bedroom, on the side table next to the bed.\n\"A few Nighthawks accepted the request and started an investigation on the puppet.\n\"The initial evaluation determined that it brought misfortune, causing people around it to be unlucky and find themselves in danger. Finally, they would die one after another. It only took two weeks for the tester to reach the brink of bankruptcy.\n\"The puppet isn't equipped with the capability to live. It doesn't have any inclinations of escaping the seal.\n\"Through extended periods of experimentation, we discovered that as long as one does not come within ten meters of it for more than half an hour a day, one wouldn't be tainted with misfortune. If misfortune has befallen someone, the person will immediately have his situation turn for the better as long as the misfortune is transferred to another person.\n\"Appendix: The puppet first appeared in the house of an old lady, Tess, who lived in the Lower Street of Iron Cross Street. She was a toymaker. Due to old age and her husband's severe illness, with both her children passing on early, she had no choice but to move to the Iron Cross Street's Lower Street.\n\"This was the last toy she sold. She exchanged the puppet for some poison hemlock and ended her and her husband's lives, having starved for more than three days.\"\nAs Klein recalled the information of Sealed Artifact 3-0625, he felt even more doubtful and horrified.\nDidn't it say the puppet isn't equipped with the capability to live? Didn't it say that it doesn't have any inclinations of escaping the seal?\nWhat did I see just now!?\nWhat dragged it back in the end?\nThe symbol that was drawn on the paper that it unfurled, what does it mean?\nThat scene earlier was like how a psychotic murderer deals with his victim as the victim slams on the gates heavily and cries for help desperately, only to be dragged back...\nWhile these thoughts flooded him, Klein decided not to make any decision on his own.\nHe returned to the duty room and pulled a rope.\nThe rope tightened, the gear spun, and there was suddenly a hurried ringtone that rang on the second floor of the Blackthorn Security Company.\nLeonard Mitchell and the other Sleepless who were playing cards in the entertainment room immediately put down their poker cards and ran to the basement."}
{"num_chp":1250,"summary":"As he had the information from the City of Silver's previous explorations, Klein knew which places were dangerous and how to avoid them. It didn't take long for him to follow the small path, pass through the Waning Forest, Barren Tunnel, and use the ancient elevator to arrive at the residence of the guards.\nAfter waiting for a while-until the \"curtain\" above the gray fog split into two, separating the Attendant of Mysteries Beyonder characteristic-Klein reached out to pull his past self out.\nHe didn't know if the other divine kingdoms would isolate the fog of history, but at least without the Giant King's Court having its owner present, no one would be able to stop his attempts.\nUnfortunately, this matter involves too many levels. I can't obtain any results from divination; otherwise, I will feel more at ease... Klein shook his head and muttered to himself.\nHe was in no hurry to jump into the fog of history. He first took out two items and handed them to his projection.\nOne of them was a deep-black wooden box. It contained the ashes of Giant Guardian Groselle.\nKlein had never forgotten his promise.\nHe had originally wanted to wait for Little Sun's second exploration of the Giant King's Court before handing him Groselle's ashes and getting him to help do the burial. However, due to various matters, he ended up coming to the Forsaken Land of the Gods and entering the Giant King's Court.\nAs for Snowman's ashes, Klein planned on scattering it into the golden sea just as he was about to leave the Forsaken Land of the Gods-it was a sea churning with the divine blood of the ancient sun god.\nAfter handing over the urn and the black iron key from Vice Admiral Iceberg, Klein followed his usual practice and leaped into the fog. He dashed to the fragment of light that represented a time before the First Epoch, and he allowed his consciousness to naturally shift to the projection he had summoned.\nThis projection didn't hold the Staff of the Stars and only wore Creeping Hunger. This was because the palace that the Giant King lived in was still quite a distance away. There were many troll statues blocking him, so Klein couldn't guarantee that he would reach his destination in five minutes.\nRight on the heels of that, he made the glove on his left hand transparent as he disappeared from where he was.\nIn the next second, Klein appeared outside the guards' residence with the huge black iron key. He hadn't \"Teleported\" too far away.\nYes, in the Giant King's Court, it's clear that most of the powers within have weakened... Only a guard acknowledged by the divine kingdom can perform at relatively normal standards? Uh, Beyonder powers similar to \"Teleportation\" have also been suppressed. I can only do \"Blink\" within a relatively small area... From the looks of it, even if I were to summon the Staff of the Stars, I wouldn't be able to appear outside the Giant King's palace by outlining the corresponding scene in my mind... As expected of an ancient god's divine kingdom... Klein seriously observed the influence his surroundings brought him.\nAfter making a preliminary judgment, he turned and walked back to the guards' residence. Opening the wooden box in his right hand, he solemnly scattered Groselle's ashes in every corner.\nAccording to the scene he saw in Groselle's dream, this guards' residence was where the giant lived for a long period of time. It was the \"home\" that he had the deepest impression and was most fond of.\nIt could be imagined that during that period of time in ancient times, Groselle and the other rational Giant Guardians from future generations would rest, rabble, gossip, talk about music, and think of fun games to play. They didn't need to worry about food and ailments. They would live every day of their lives happily...\nWith the shaking of Klein's hands, the ashes scattered on the wall, the ground, the bedside, the tables, chairs, and stone pillars.\nThe orange light outside the window shone forever, making everything look peaceful.\nWhen the last speck of ashes was scattered, the dusk suddenly deepened. It dyed the scattered ashes orange, becoming a part of the divine kingdom.\nKlein closed his eyes as though he could sense Groselle's joy.\nA vagrant who had been forced to leave his hometown for three thousand years had finally returned to the place he had missed day and night.\nThe light of the dusk softened, making Klein feel that he was less ostracized.\nEh... It's equivalent to being acknowledged to a certain extent. I've become a guard that has been accepted by a number of people. Klein emanated his spirituality to confirm the changes.\nHe didn't stay any longer. He used Creeping Hunger and the path scouted by the City of Silver's expedition team to constantly \"Blink\" and take detours. From time to time, he would pull out the Unshadowed Crucifix. He passed through the hall where the fateful plot was made with relatively little difficulty, and he arrived at the residence of the Giant King. There, he saw a row of huge stone columns on the left that formed railings. Beyond the railings was an orange-red gas and a churning dark blue sea.\nTaking a deep breath, he returned to the hall he had just exited. He reached out his hand and dragged out the marionette, Enuni, who hadn't been \"Parasitized\" by Amon.\nEven if it was a historical projection, he didn't want to open the door himself!\nLooking at the slightly dazed Enuni, Klein handed the black iron key that he had tucked under his armpit over to him. He controlled Enuni to leave the hall and follow the railings formed from stone pillars to the tallest and most magnificent building in the Giant King's Court.\nThe dusk's glow seemed to be corporeal as it covered the palace's surface, bringing with it a strong sense of decadence, as though the curtains had drawn on everything in the world.\nLining both sides of the palace were separately steeples and spires. The grayish-blue front door was covered with mysterious symbols as it stood at a height exceeding ten meters.\nTo the left of the door, there was a pitch-black hole that was the size of an adult's fist at the height of three to four meters.\nEnuni stared at it for a few seconds before raising the black iron key that resembled a seven-string guitar and inserting it into the deep crevice in front of him.\nIt fit perfectly without leaving a single gap.\nAs the gigantic black iron key entered the deep hole, Klein held his breath in the nearby grand hall, constantly preparing to remove his existence.\nWith a click, the black iron key in Enuni's hand reached the end.\nIt suddenly turned soft, as if it had fused with the hole as it emitted grayish-blue light.\nThe various symbols, labels, and patterns on the door lit up as they protruded.\nAll the lights quickly interfered in a constructive manner, pressing down heavily into the inner chamber as it slowly opened the grayish-blue palace door.\nThe gap between the door widened when Enuni's eyes suddenly reflected a turbulent pitch-black, viscous, and illusory sea.\nNot good... Warning bells sounded in Klein's mind.\nWithout any hesitation, his consciousness returned to his body as he severed the connection with his Historical Void projection.\nIn the next second, his vision suddenly darkened. The left side of his head felt a sharp pain, as though someone had inserted a red-hot chisel into it and kept rotating it.\nAt the same time, he heard indistinguishable ravings that seemed to come from an era older than ancient times.\nKlein's expression instantly twisted, appearing extremely ferocious.\nHe could still barely maintain his rationality, but he had no energy left to remain in the historical fragment.\nWithout a sound, Klein landed in the guard residence of the Giant King's Court. With a thought, he entered the world above the gray fog.\nBefore undertaking such a dangerous task, he had no doubt found a reason and excuse to arrange for the members of the Tarot Club to pray collectively to awaken Sefirah Castle's ability to \"summon\" its master. This allowed him to skip taking four steps counterclockwise and reciting the incantation at critical moments to return above the gray fog.\nHowever, just as Klein's Spirit Body saw the grayish-white fog, he heard a familiar roar, he felt himself be rejected by Sefirah Castle, as though it had accepted an order from someone else to stop him from entering.\nThis... In his shock, he saw a black shadow leap past him, heading straight for Sefirah Castle!\nIt wasn't Amon, but a shadow that exuded an aura identical to his!\nSubconsciously, Klein influenced Sefirah Castle and made it reject the intruder.\nThen, he succeeded. The shadow was also blocked by the grayish-white fog as well.\nRight on the heels of that, he and the shadow fell back into the real world at the same time.\nAfter his Spirit Body returned to his body, Klein bent down in pain, like a curled shrimp.\nThe half top hat on his head fell to the ground.\nHe took several seconds to eventually recover. He slowly straightened his body and cast his gaze on a glass window ground from orange gems.\nThe window reflected his current appearance:\nWith the bridge of his nose as a border, his right face was the same as usual, but countless objects were crawling out of his left face.\nKlein narrowed his eyes.\nHe hurriedly took a deep breath to calm himself down and regain the Clown powers of control.\nHis mind outlined a clear image of his appearance.\nHe was dressed in a black trench coat, had black hair and brown eyes. The right side of Gehrman Sparrow's cut face was the same as usual, while the left side had become translucent and was formed from twisting maggots.\nAs he looked down, his neck was in a similar state. It was the same with his body that lay beneath his clothes.\nThe edge of losing control... Man, I need to resist the inclination towards intense madness... W-why? Suddenly, he sensed something. He instinctively lowered his head and looked at his feet.\nIt was empty. He was missing the shadow that was supposed to exist.\nThe orange light of the evening shone through the window, but it didn't create a shadow by his side.\n\"Haha, I understand.\" Klein bent down and laughed uncontrollably.\nHe suspected that the \"seawater\" that surged out from the Giant King's palace had not only \"drowned\" his marionette and historical projection, but it had also used the latter to slice off his own shadow, causing his spirit to lose its completeness. He was unable to completely suppress his inclination towards losing control.\nAs for the shadow, which was slightly equivalent to him, it could also affect Sefirah Castle. This resulted in a situation in which both parties were unable to head above the gray fog.\nAs long as I get rid of that shadow, the problem can be solved... The corner of his right forehead twitched as he straightened his back.\nAt that moment, the orange light that shone from outside was dyed gold, becoming rather resplendent. It made the entire Giant King's Court seem to retrograde from dusk to noon.\nWith a thought, he cast his gaze out the window as an image appeared in his mind.\nIn front of the tallest and most magnificent building in the Giant King's Court, Marionette Enuni stood there, facing the door.\nIt was dark past the door, impossible to see anything clearly.\nSuddenly, Enuni turned around and looked down.\nHis face was covered in a shadow, and his hair turned deep black that draped over his shoulders and curled up slightly.\nOn his back, there were pairs of dark illusory wings.\nIn the grand hall nearby, a pure shadow's lower body was pressed against a stone brick as its upper body came over in a ramrod manner."}
{"num_chp":68,"summary":"At dusk, the setting sun cast long shadows of the carriages and horses.\nHaving informed Benson and Melissa that he was having dinner at the Blackthorn Security Company, Klein headed to the harbor with Old Neil on a public carriage.\nHe was dressed in cheap formal attire, afraid that conflict might break out in such a complicated location-if he damaged his tuxedo which he took painstaking care of, he would probably cry his heart out.\nWhen the sunlight appeared to turn fiery, the carriage stopped. Old Neil, in his usual classic black robe and felt black hat with a rounded edge, ignored the gazes of others and walked diagonally to the Evil Dragon Bar in ahead of them.\nEven though the bar was slightly far away and the heavy doors were tightly shut, Klein still heard wave after wave of rapturous shouts. They appeared to be cheering on a hero.\nWhen he came close, he suddenly sensed something. He turned his head towards the warehouse opposite to the bar. He saw a stocky man dressed in a uniform standing at a hidden corner on the rooftop.\nThe man carried a huge grayish-white mechanical box and held a thick rifle in his hand.\nThe grayish-white mechanical box was obviously connected to the same-colored rifle via piping.\n\"Steam-pressured rifle?\" Klein muttered in shock. He looked at Old Neil and said, \"This bar can actually obtain such weapons?\"\nThat was a military-controlled item!\nAlthough it used extracted\u00a0phlogiston1, the size and weight of the steam backpack were still shocking, something only a true warrior of blood and iron could withstand. The rifle had an extremely high muzzle velocity and shocking destructive power too.\nMatched with a suitable scope, it was nearly equivalent to an inferior sniper rifle.\n\"What?\" Old Neil squinted his eyes as he looked over, having a confused look too. \"Did something happen here?\"\nSomething happened?Klein surveyed his surroundings and discovered a few more men holding repeating rifles who were searching for something.\n\"What happened?\" Old Neil approached the bar and asked the brawny man guarding its door outside.\nThe brawny man obviously knew Old Neil and smiled wryly.\n\"The bar was nearly destroyed earlier.\n\"Apparently a wanted man was here trying to buy materials and was recognized. And this was what resulted from it. Oh Lord, what did he do, and how dangerous was he to receive such treatment? My legs went limp seeing all those firearms, limper than after spending an entire night with Ginger Sunny!\"\nHe did not know the identity of the wanted man, much less know that the people who came to buy materials had Beyonders mixed in.\n\"Wanted man? Do you know his name?\" Old Neil asked in interest.\n\"I think it was Tris or something?\" the brawny man answered uncertainly.\nInstigator Tris?Klein nodded in enlightenment, having understood what was happening.\nTris did not know that Joyce Meyer had cast his suspicion on him; therefore, he had sauntered right into the market to purchase materials without heed. He was likely recognized by an informant of either the Machinery Hivemind or the Nighthawks, resulting in an intense clash.\n\"Was he caught?\" Klein tapped his silver-inlaid black cane.\nBased on the surrounding situation, likely not...\nThe brawny man shook his head slightly and gestured with his chin to the rooftop of the warehouse opposite him.\n\"He rushed out before those terrifying guys arrived. Bloody hell, I've never seen a man run faster than he did!\"\nYou haven't seen the true skills of an Assassin, or you might be taken away to some indescribable place for further reeducation...Klein thought.\n\"Is the market still open?\" Old Neil changed subjects and asked.\n\"It just restored operations,\" replied the brawny man affirmatively.\n\"That's great.\" Old Neil quickened his pace and extended his right hand, pushing open the heavy door.\nKlein followed closely in tow and walked in. He nearly fainted at the stuffiness and smell of alcohol that inundated him.\nIn the middle of Evil Dragon Bar was a boxing ring. Two half-naked men were in an intense brawl and surrounding them were dozens of customers shouting and cheering on the side they supported with no lack of vulgarities.\nOld Neil ignored them and led Klein around the boxing ring and walked into a billiard room at the back.\nIn the billiard room, there were two people holding cue sticks, having a casual conversation. When they saw Old Neil enter, they instantly fell silent for a few seconds.\nAfter confirming the visitor's identity, they moved aside and let Old Neil and Klein pass through the secret door behind them.\nAfter passing through a few rooms, the sight before Klein's eyes opened up. He saw a place that was about the size of a lecture hall from his previous life.\nSome vendors had set up roadside stalls with bottles and cans all over. Passers-by strolled through them, either scrutinizing their goods, chatting, or comparing prices.\n\"They have to give five percent of their profits to Swain. Ah, he is the boss of Evil Dragon Bar, former captain of a Mandated Punisher squad and older than I am. He's someone who wishes to drink himself to his death,\" Old Neil explained in a garrulous manner.\nKlein thought and gave an honest evaluation.\n\"A rather profitable business.\"\nAfter all, his only expense was providing the venue and protection.\n\"If any item catches your fancy but you lack the money, you can borrow from Swain. But of course, he charges a very high interest...\" Old Neil trailed off as he gnashed his teeth.\nAs expected, it's like running a casino, they would provide usuries...Klein held his walking stick and looked around as he asked curiously, \"Mr. Swain is a Seafarer?\"\nThe captain of a Mandated Punisher squad was likely a Sequence 7.\n\"No, he is only a Folk of Rage. Tingen is not a coastal city, so the Church of the Goddess is much more powerful than Lord of Storms here.\" Old Neil scoffed. \"Actually, Swain had the chance of becoming a Seafarer, but was afraid that he would lose control so he chose to give up.\"\nJust as Klein was about to ask if the boss of the bar had any experience of nearly losing control, he suddenly felt a strange phenomenon happen on his left.\nThere appeared to be something hidden there, muttering and recounting.\nKlein turned his head and saw a pale young man. He was wearing an old linen shirt and blue jeans that the working class normally wore. His eyes looked demoralized with a hint of craziness, and he was constantly mumbling.\n\"His spiritual perception is very high... or perhaps, distorted?\" Klein creased his eyebrows and muttered.\nIt was the young man's spiritual perception that triggered his own spiritual perception!\nGenerally speaking, spiritual perception sensing something causes some interaction. It was nearly impossible to conceal it from others, but \"others\" referred to Spirit Mediums who had cast their abilities, as well as powerful figures with similar special traits. A Beyonder like Klein would actually find it hard to detect, only detecting if one's spiritual perception reached a certain heightened level, or an abnormal distortion happened.\nThey made eye contact and the pale young man with messy black hair walked towards him with an expression looking as though he was half-sleepwalking and half-insane.\nHe stopped before Klein and stared at him.\nSuddenly, he guffawed.\n\"Haha, it's the smell of death, death... Ah!\"\nBefore he was done talking, he suddenly screamed tragically. His eyes shut tightly as liquid with the color of blood flowed out.\n\"Ah! Darn it!\" The young man covered his eyes and hugged his head. He struggled on the ground and only calmed down after a while. He then lay there panting.\nDuring the entire process, not a single customer or stall vendor looked over.\nKlein pressed down his halved top hat and looked at Old Neil. Klein's mouth was hanging open in shock, using his actions to demonstrate his shock and to request for advice.\n\"Don't mind him. He's Ademisaul, an orphan, nicknamed \u2018monster.' He was born with high spiritual perception, and he has always been able to see things that he shouldn't, hear voices that he shouldn't. Hence, he is always raving and often getting hurt.\" Old Neil shook his head as he explained.\nHe could tell that my body was once dead?Klein knitted his eyebrows and lowered his voice as he asked in doubt, \"Haven't the Nighthawks, Mandated Punishers, or the Machinery Hivemind ever thought of taking him in?\"\n\"No, we do not have the Sequence potion that suits him,\" said Old Neil with a sigh.\nRight, he was born with the starting point of half a Sequence...Klein asked again curiously,\n\"What Sequence pathway suits him?\"\n\"The Sequence 9 that suits him is called \u2018Monster.' His nickname came from there. It's a pity that only the Life School of Thought has control over the Sequence pathway's beginning,\" Old Neil replied softly.\nHe tried to keep the conversation between him and Klein from the people around them to avoid leaking information to mysticism aficionados.\nLife School of Thought?Klein recalled the information he had previously read.\nThe secret organization appeared in the beginning of the current epoch. Its actual origins were unknown, but it was mainly passed down via master and disciple.\nTheir theories and beliefs were hardly known. Klein only knew that they separated the world into three layers: the definite rational world, also known as the absolute truth world, the spirits' world, and the material world.\nRumor had it that the secret organization had once produced a Soothsayer... Wasn't that a Sequence pathway that corresponded to Seer? Confusing, really confusing...Klein shook his head and saw Ademisaul struggle to get up and then wander off to another corner.\nHe reorganized his thoughts and followed behind Old Neil. They walked past one stall after another. There were plants like moon flower, fingered citron, night vanilla, and mineral resources like silver, topaz, ruby and so on.\n\"It's really very well equipped...\" Klein muttered softly.\nThe mysticism aficionados of all ages and genders around him would be stopping, distinguishing, or talking at times. It gave the area a bustling vibe.\n\"Walk around on your own. I am going to settle my bill.\" Old Neil pointed at one of the two rooms at the end.\n\"Alright.\" Klein nodded without thought.\nHe strolled with his black cane and came before a stall which sold self-made amulets. He took a careful look at it for a while.\nJust when Klein prepared to speak with the seller, he suddenly heard someone asking the stall behind him, \"Is this powder ground from cow teeth paeonol?\"\nCow teeth paeonol? Isn't that one of the supplementary ingredients of the Spectator potion?Klein thought, then turned around to look at the inquirer.\nJustice had repeated the formula for the potion several times, so Klein had been left with a remarkably clear impression of the ingredients."}
{"num_chp":230,"summary":"Empress Borough. In an unremarkable house.\nXio and Fors took a seat at random and examined the writing on the blackboard. Like always, Mr. A was sitting quietly, alone on the sofa at the front in his hooded robe, looking down at the crowd from a high vantage point.\nSequence 8 Sheriff potion formula. 450 pounds...Xio silently read the familiar content as she inwardly let out of sigh of relief.\nThe situation she feared the most was the lack of a seller when she had finally amassed the money with great difficulty!\nI received 400 pounds from the split, plus my original savings of 150 pounds, that's enough... However, I'd definitely need a huge sum of money for the main ingredient... Ah right, maybe I can change circles and see if there are any Beyonders who are interested in this formula...Xio suddenly felt invigorated, and she realized that she had found a way to make a fortune.\nFrankly speaking, there was no way she would leak the formula if she wasn't in desperate need for money to buy the materials to concoct the potion. On the one hand, most people always hoped that there were fewer Beyonders in their own Sequences, and on the other hand, the price of the corresponding ingredients would be raised significantly if there were many competitors who bid up the prices of the ingredients. It was the same with the subsequent potions.\nAfter some serious thought, Xio slowly became nervous again, because it was normal for a recipe to be placed on sale for a long time without being sold.\nMoreover, the Arbiter pathway belonged to the royal family and the military. All aspects were strictly controlled, and the leaked ones came from a small number of destitute nobles. There were hardly any complete formulas for the low to mid Sequences. Often, only one or two of them were complete and compounded with the knowledge that the main ingredients were controlled and difficult to obtain. Beyonders who chose this Sequence were rather rare.\nXio had been in some mysticism circles in Backlund for a long period of time, but she hadn't found an Arbiter apart from herself. On the one hand, the others might have concealed it well, but on the other hand, that might also explain the problems faced in this Sequence pathway.\nPhew, but compared to Fors, I'm lucky enough. She hasn't encountered any of the subsequent recipes for Apprentice all this time...Xio saw Mr. A's attendant approaching and wrote a note saying that she was purchasing the Sheriff's recipe.\nBefore long, she was led to the study on the first floor. Before entering, she took a hooded robe from the attendant and covered herself with it.\nThe seller in the study was dressed in the same way, so they couldn't see each other's faces clearly.\n\"This is the formula to the Sheriff potion. Where's my money?\" the seller asked with a hoarse voice as he pressed a piece of paper on the desk.\nXio pulled out the cash that she had long counted numerous times and pushed it to the seller.\nAfter checking the authenticity of the notes and the total sum, the seller finally released the potion formula he held.\nXio immediately took one step forward and grabbed the note.\nHer eyes swept straight to the main ingredients as they were of great importance.\n\"A pair of Terror Demon Worm's eyes. Silver War Bear's right palm.\"\nBeyonder items I know of, but I've never seen them being sold...Xio sighed and walked out of the study and took off her robe.\nBack in the living room, she sat beside Fors. Having fulfilled her wish, she slowly began to worry about the unknown honorary name and the evil spirit that might be haunting her.\n10, no, 20, no, 30 to request for someone skilled in exorcism to do a purification ritual for me.Xio made up her mind, and after exchanging a few whispered words with Fors, she beckoned for Mr. A's attendant.\nAfter the end of the free communication break, she saw her request appear as an additional entry on the blackboard.\n\"Suspected haunting of evil spirits. Requesting the help of friends who specialize in exorcism. 30 pounds.\"\nAfter a while, Mr. A's attendant came to the two of them and quietly invited them to the living room on the first floor.\nThere was a man wearing a white mask inside. He looked at the two people who were wearing loose robes that concealed their genders and chuckled.\n\"Let me introduce myself first, so that you won't doubt my ability.\"\n\"No, no, we trust Mr. A,\" Xio, with her hood over her face, said before Fors could open her mouth.\nShe deliberately suppressed her voice to prevent her childish voice from revealing her identity.\nThe man with the white mask spread his hands and laughed.\n\"This is my habit, I am a believer of the Sun. As you know, this is not common in Backlund, or in the entire kingdom.\n\"It is only through moments like this that I can live as my true self.\"\nDue to the great conflict between the Church of the Eternal Blazing Sun and the Church of the Lord of Storms, the former had never been able to obtain the right to proselytize in the Loen Kingdom.\n\"A believer of the Sun?\" Fors's languid look instantly vanished. \"This is the first time I'm seeing a living believer of the Sun! Eh... It's not like I can meet diplomats of higher standing.\"\n\"Then, should I feel honored?\" The man in the white mask spread his arms wide and held them up in a gesture of praise for the Sun.\nInstead of answering his question, Fors smiled and said, \"In terms of exorcism and purification, the attendant of the Sun is a professional. Our hearts are at rest, so we can begin.\"\nThe man who claimed to be a believer of the Sun didn't drone on. He took out a badge with the symbol of the \"Sun\" on it and placed it on the round table in the center. Then, he used a dualistic ritual method to light up two candles.\nAfter finishing the preparatory steps one step at a time, he chanted with a loud and abnormally pious tone.\n\"The Sun that is Eternal,\n\"You are an Inextinguishable Light.\n\"You are the Embodiment of Order\n\"I pray to you,\n\"Please bestow me with your cleansing glow.\n\"Please repel the evils spirits in this body.\"\n...\nAmid the echoing Hermes incantation, Xio and Fors saw bright light burst out from the Sun's emblem, bursting in a pure and warm manner.\nIt was endless, like the tide, as the light surged towards the two of them, engulfing them simultaneously.\nNearly a minute later, everything was restored to normal. All Xio and Fors felt was warmth, finding the warmth very comfortable and relieving. It was like soaking in a hot spring, or having gone sunbathing.\n...\nCherwood Borough. Rice Police Station.\nKlein was sitting on a low bench with a group of thieves and drunkards. It looked very disgraceful.\nSuddenly, he felt warmth on the back of his hand as the coldness of the Backlund night was dispelled quite significantly.\nLowering his head, Klein realized that the four black dots representing the mysterious space above the gray fog didn't appear.\nWho's being so kind? To know that I was feeling a little cold just now...he mumbled half jokingly and half-curious.\nAs a former inspector, he looked at the thief on the left who was handcuffed to the pipe, then at the drunkard on the right who could vomit at any moment but kept yelling about hitting people. He sighed at his present predicament and wasn't sure when he would be free from this.\nThere should be another test after this and then I'll be fine once I pass it... I hope the police will have their attention on the ambassador and the Zmanger gang, and ignore my origins as a puny detective. In theory, there's a high chance for that. As long as Mrs. Sammer, Mr. Jurgen, and the others don't say anything of interest to the police... Yes, they have only just met me so it's impossible for them to know too much...\nMeursault's Beyonder characteristic was taken away by me and was hidden above the gray fog. He didn't leave behind anything strange, so no one would able to discover that he used to be a Beyonder and have questions about my strength... Hmm... More than an hour has passed...\nIn his self-encouragement, Klein saw the officer with the short brownish-yellow beard walking towards him.\n\"Sherlock Moriarty, come with me to the interrogation room,\" the sergeant said without further explanation.\nHere it comes...Klein stood up and followed.\nAfter going around a corner, the sergeant stopped in front of an iron door and gestured for Klein to enter.\nKlein took a deep breath before exhaling. He yanked the handle and opened the door.\nIt was a small room with thick walls and a small table in the middle. There were chairs on both sides of the table.\nUnder the elegant gas lamp's illumination, Klein identified the interrogator as a man who wore a black shirt, a rather uncommon sight.\nHe didn't wear a vest but wore a black coat that wasn't part of the usual formal attire. He had thin eyebrows and cold blue eyes. His face was cut, looking rigid while lacking any gentleness.\nThe man pointed the chair opposite him and said in a deep voice, \"I ask, you answer.\"\nBefore he finished his sentence, Klein felt an unimaginable suppressive force on him. He felt that an electric current was tearing through his mind that lashed at his soul with a barbed whip.\nThis \"feeling\" was painful and numbing, as though it stemmed from deep within the brain. It was barely resistible, and all he could do was tremble and have his knees buckle.\nKlein nearly fell to the ground as he hurriedly held onto the table and sat down. His temples felt a throbbing pain.\nThis... this is the result of Beyonder powers...Ordinary people might've thought of it as a psychological problem caused by nervousness and the authority of the interrogator opposite them, but Klein had clearly identified that this was a result of Beyonder powers, powers that could directly attack the mind of others!\nHe quickly recalled the information he had seen before and quickly confirmed the target of his suspicion.\nArbiter pathway, Sequence 7: Interrogator!\nHas the matter been transferred to a special department of the military?Klein thought with some relief.\nAs long as it isn't the Nighthawks, everything's fine.\n\"Identify the ambassador who met Meursault from these photographs.\" The cold and unyielding man in black spread out eight black-and-white photos on the small table.\nKlein felt as if the electric whip in his mind was being lifted high, and the warning of extreme pain made it so he didn't dare to lie.\nOf course, there was no need for Klein to lie. After a moment of identification, he pushed a photo in the direction of the interrogator. It was a middle-aged gentleman who wore ostentatious clothing and looked rather charming.\nThe interrogator glanced at it, but didn't make any response. He once again asked, \"Were your previous statements the truth?\"\nKlein felt like he was being forced into a dream. He kept his mind clear and rational, and he didn't yield to the \"whip\" in his mind as he sincerely replied, \"Nothing but the truth.\"\nThe interrogator leaned forward with his hands on the small table and said, \"When was the last time you met Ian Wright?\"\n\"Yesterday, yesterday morning,\" Klein said with great difficulty, \"I tailed Meursault and found the body of Detective Zreal. As I didn't want to deal with the police, I took Ian to identify the body and told him to call the police. Zreal's body was located at the sewer entrance at the bottom of Iron Carbon Street in East Borough.\"\nAfter a brief silence, the interrogator finally nodded his head. Klein immediately felt the enormous pressure disappear along with the \"whip\" in his mind.\n\"You may leave now,\" he said without a trace of emotion in his voice.\nKlein stood up and opened the door, not masking the frailty in his gait.\nHe found it more tiring than fighting Meursault. If he made the slightest mistake, his spirit would've been completely crushed, and he would obediently answer any question that the other party asked.\nNo, if it wasn't for the fact that my spirit is special and how it's been subjected to the test of raving and screaming for a long period of time, allowing me to maintain my calm and rationality under certain circumstances, I would've most likely had a mental breakdown just now...Klein walked back down the corridor, his back feeling cold.\nAt this moment, the sergeant from before came over and said, \"Come with me to fill out some forms. Lawyer Jurgen is waiting to bail you out.\"\nPhew...Klein secretly exhaled and completely relaxed.\nHe knew that the danger was over."}
{"num_chp":243,"summary":"Wednesday morning, across from the Coim Company, in the Cherwood Borough.\nKlein was sitting on a wooden bench outside the Gardeley department store, clutching a paper bag containing the most famous Cyndi Desi pie in the area with one hand, and holding a cup of iced tea in the other.\nBeside him, a tramp was curled up on the other side of the bench, sleeping. Ten minutes later, the mall's security guard woke him up and shooed him away.\nKlein wore gold-rimmed spectacles which didn't provide for any vision correction and a silk half top hat. He didn't look much different from most of the gentlemen around him.\nHe idly looked across the street at the Coim Company, lifted his right hand, and took a large bite of the Cyndi Desi pie. He felt the rich aroma gush out and fill his oral cavity.\nThe reason why this pie from Desi Bay stood out amongst the southern pies was that it used a lot of oil and fat, but the meat was chopped into very tiny bits. With the fat and lean meat mixed together, it didn't feel too heavy.\nThe rich, meaty juice seeped into the outer crust, neutralizing the dryness and made up for its shortcomings. The wheat fragrance was clearly brought out, and the small pieces of crushed apples were used to stimulate appetite with a slightly sour and sweet taste while neutralizing the oily taste.\nIt's okay... Although the weather isn't good and the pollution is terrible, Backlund is far superior to Tingen in many other aspects. Foods of all styles can be found everywhere. There are all kinds of operas and plays available. They can be enjoyed as long as one isn't afraid to spend money... Although I might not necessarily eat or partake in such entertainment, I have these options at the very least. This is the advantage of a big city...Klein raised his sweet iced tea and took a sip.\nHe never took his eyes off the Coim Company's entrance. For that ten pounds, he had been sitting there since eight in the morning. Even his breakfast was bought on the way there.\nOf course, for most private detectives, a commission of ten pounds was an absolutely enviable business, equivalent to about three weeks' salary for a member of the middle class!\nAccording to the information provided by Mary Gale, her husband was currently the first manager of Coim Company and was Luke Sammer's superior; however, their shares in the Coim Company came from Mary's father, and Mary had inherited it.\nOne of the immediate reasons she suspected her husband of having a mistress was that an employee in the company had divulged to her that Doragu Gale would leave the office on Wednesday and Friday mornings alone and only return in the afternoon. In addition, he would leave work early for two days a week, and Mary had never seen her husband return home before seven.\nAfter breakfast, Klein waited another hour plus before seeing his target walk out of Coim.\nHe was wearing a black top hat, a double-breasted tweed coat, and a standard bow tie. He was slightly fat, with yellowish temples, slightly brownish eyes, and a slightly long face.\nDoragu Gale...He silently recited his target's name, stood up, picked up his cane and his heavy portable camera, and crossed the road.\nInstead of getting his carriage driver to pick him up, he stood by the side of the road and looked around for a rental carriage.\nKlein took the opportunity to cross the road and arrive beside him. Pretending to be careless, he bumped into his target.\n\"Sorry, I'm quite lost.\" Klein bowed his head in apology.\nDoragu frowned, but remained silent, waving his hand to indicate that it didn't matter.\nKlein bent down, bowed, and walked to the end of the street.\nHe didn't run into Doragu in order to steal his belongings and use the dowsing method to easily track him. That would've been easily noticeable.\nInstead, Klein had only done one thing when he collided with Doragu. With the help of his agility as a Clown, he had secretly slipped a spare button of his into one of the pockets of Doragu's double-breasted coat.\nGoing around a corner, he stopped and looked back just in time to see Doragu board a rental carriage.\nKlein was in no hurry to tail him. He waited patiently for a few minutes before slowly getting into another horse carriage and said to the carriage driver, \"Just go according to my instructions. Head to the end of the street first.\"\n\"Alright.\" The driver didn't ask why.\nInside the carriage, Klein leaned his cane and began performing a divination.\nHowever, his divination statement wasn't directed at Doragu Gale; instead, it became \"the whereabouts of the spare button of my clothes!\"\nThe Dowsing Rod Seeking was originally the most practical technique to find objects. Only Seers were able to use it to seek people. Now, Klein was using it in its original form.\nThe easiest and most convenient items to find were those that belonged to himself!\nAlong the way, Klein kept getting the carriage driver to change directions until they finally arrived at a street house in the Hillston Borough. When they first circled it, Klein noticed that there were gardens and lawns behind the house, which was different from the other houses.\nHis dowsing method told him that Doragu Gale was inside that house.\nAfter paying the two-soli fare, Klein walked to the door with marble statues outside. He saw two men in black and white plaid uniforms that resembled the police uniform.\n\"I don't know you. Where's your proof of membership?\" One of them, a brown-skinned man of Southern Continent blood, stopped Klein.\n\"Proof of membership?\" Klein hid his heavy camera behind him and asked with a slight frown.\nThe brown-skinned man immediately turned stern.\n\"This is the Quelaag Club. Only our members and up to one of their guests can enter.\"\nKlein tersely acknowledged.\n\"Then how can I join your club?\"\n\"You can only join after receiving a recommendation from two members,\" The brown-skinned man didn't brutally chase him away, but patiently answered the question.\nHe couldn't guarantee that Klein would end up joining the club eventually.\n\"Alright.\" Klein pursed his lips and decided to put Plan B into motion.\nHe found a hotel near the Quelaag Club and got a short-stay room for four hours.\nThen, he locked the door behind him, drew the curtains, and entered the space above the gray fog. He conjured a yellowish-brown goatskin and a fountain pen in front of him.\nTaking a deep breath, Klein wrote the exact same divination sentence as before: \"The whereabouts of the spare button of my clothes.\"\nThis time, he didn't use the dowsing method, but a dream divination!\nThe reason why he didn't do it in the real world was because Klein felt that the Quelaag Club seemed to be quite a high-end club, and he suspected that there might be some powerful Beyonders inside. In order to not waste time, he decided to get it done once and for all.\nIn the gray dreamy world, Klein was the first to see Doragu's black coat, which was hung on a coat rack. On the carpet in front of it was a round table.\nThe scene zoomed out, and the sight of a romping man and woman entered Klein's eye. The man was Doragu Gale, the woman had shimmering blond hair who looked rather young. She was in her early twenties at most.\nThe pained expression with her knitted brows does look rather coquettish... Why am I always seeing scenes such as this...Klein covered his eyes and woke up.\nThe fact that Doragu has a mistress is confirmed... How do I get material evidence... By responding to my prayers? But this is limited to what I can obtain with my own body. I can only do it through sketching and not through the camera... I can't possibly draw a picture with my bare hands, can I? It looks like today won't do. I'll tail that girl and find out her address and name later. I refuse to believe that they'll be inside the Quelaag Club every time they meet...Detective Klein quickly came up with his next course of action.\nJust as he was about to leave the mysterious space above the gray fog, he suddenly thought of something.\nHe decided to take the opportunity to divine if the iron-black threadworm which had infiltrated his room was under the control of a Beyonder of the Seer pathway.\nHe didn't do so before because he felt that the relevant information was too scarce, and it was difficult to create something out of nothing which would result in a failed divination. It would've been the same if he was above the gray fog. Furthermore, he had various matters to divine the few times he came above the gray fog previously, and he didn't have the capacity to bother with such a question. Now that he was free, he decided that it wouldn't hurt to do the divination.\nAs for the question of whether it was risky to contact Azik, he had already long divined it. The answer was that it was risky, and not something trivial, so he could only use it as his last resort.\nAfter writing the corresponding divination statement, Klein removed the silver chain from his sleeve and allowed the topaz pendant to hang over the paper.\n\"The iron-black threadworm that sneaked into my room was controlled by a Beyonder from the Seer pathway.\"\n...\nAfter repeating it seven times, Klein opened his eyes and saw that the spirit pendulum was spinning clockwise, with great amplitude and frequency.\nPositive... The answer is positive!\nShouldn't it have failed?Klein didn't expect to obtain such an answer. According to his Seer instincts, such a divination was likely to fail.\nWhy?He frowned and thought for a while before deciding to switch to a different method of divination and target.\nHe wanted to directly divine the controller using dream divination!\nThis time, Klein saw nothing in his dream, and couldn't get the corresponding revelation about the Seer pathway Beyonder.\n\"That's more like it...\" he muttered and thought back to the prior divination and fell into deep thought.\nThey should've been a lack of conditions and result in a failed divination just like the one that followed... Could it be that this mysterious space had filled in the necessary conditions? Does it contain something of the Seer pathway?Klein suddenly had a flash of inspiration. He had a bold idea!\nPerhaps, the mysterious space above the gray fog had something to do with the path of the Seer pathway!\nHmm...Klein lightly rapped the edge of the ancient table. Despite thinking about it, he couldn't find any other evidence. He could only temporarily put this matter on hold and prepare for his return to the real world.\nRegardless, I've confirmed at least one thing. The Mid-Sequence Beyonder beside the Ambassador is from the Seer pathway and whether he's a member of the Seer doesn't matter... This might be my chance of obtaining the Sequence 7 and even the Sequence 6 potion formula!Klein extended his spirituality and wrapped it around him before plunging into the gray fog.\n...\nMeanwhile, in Viscount Glaint's study.\nAudrey let the master of the study guard the door while she looked at Xio and Fors. After a few seconds of silence, she said, \"I need your help with a mission.\"\n\"What mission?\" Xio's eyes lit up as if she could smell the ink on the bills.\nAudrey gave her a polite smile.\n\"Assassinate the Intis ambassador to the Loen Kingdom, Bakerland Jean Madan.\""}
{"num_chp":794,"summary":"Someone else is selling?Klein ruminated over those words without immediately asking. After the servant placed the silver three-layered tray down for high tea and left, he said with a smile, \"Ma'am, why don't you purchase it yourself?\n\"Even a blind person knows that Loen will place more attention on environmental pollution in the future. Therefore, the Coim Company, that deal with anthracite and high-quality charcoal, definitely has a promising future. It being worth half a million or even a million pounds wouldn't be a fantasy. Of course, the premise is that the company's management can keep up with the corresponding expansion.\n\"In such a situation, the acquisition of shares in the Coim Company is definitely a profitable business. If I were you, I'd take it for myself, no matter how much debt I get myself into.\"\nMary used two fingers to pick a cucumber sandwich from the bottom silver tray, took a tiny nimble, and slowly chewed before swallowing it down.\nWith this as a buffer, she finally organized her words.\n\"Ever since the law to fix atmospheric pollution was passed, the Coim Company has been rapidly developing. The faces of the shareholders have begun changing. As you know, people who have their sights on money will often have good business sense. And behind them, there are usually some powerful figures at play.\n\"If I weren't a member of the National Atmospheric Pollution Council, and had used this to get to know quite a number of nobles and high-ranking government officials, I believe I wouldn't be able to withstand the pressure, and I would end up selling my shares at a relatively good price. I would then leave the stage with a considerably good profit.\n\"But even so, most of the shares will quickly concentrate, and I'll quickly lose my status as the highest shareholder, losing control over the company's direction.\n\"This is something I inherited from my father. I don't want it to become somebody else's toy. I wish for it to slowly develop into the biggest anthracite and high-quality supplier to Backlund, or even all of the Loen Kingdom. Heh heh, it's not that I haven't tried other solutions. I've pledged my shares and sold my property, investing a large sum of my liquidity into it, absorbing 15% of the shares in secret, as well as requesting friends that I can trust to help. I've obtained a total of 10% of the shares, and together with the 20% I originally had, I hold 45% in total.\n\"The current situation is that a minor shareholder suddenly decided to liquidate his 3%, and my friends and I temporarily do not have the money to acquire it.\"\nThis is a commercial war...This was a first for Klein, who was accustomed to dealing with Beyonders; he found it fresh but also unfamiliar.\nHe similarly reached out his hand and selected a sandwich which had high-quality turkey at the bottom of the three-layered tray. As he ate, he contemplated for about ten seconds and said, \"The shares that you acquire later can also be pledged, right?\"\n\"There won't be enough time. The other party has already provided an offer, and the transaction can be closed at any time,\" Mary said as she finished the food in her hand.\nKlein leaned back into his sofa in a relaxed manner.\n\"Why did you come to me?\"\nUpon hearing the question, Mary heaved a slight sigh of relief.\n\"First, you must've brought quite a sizable amount of money to Backlund. You wouldn't need to raise funds through different means. Second, you just came to Backlund, so you aren't deeply involved with the other party or in other aspects. This also means that I'm not afraid that you would violate the terms of the agreement. Even if you choose to align with them, you'll have to consider if it's worth violating the law. Third, although we've only met once, I believe you are a very dignified and knowledgeable gentleman.\"\nYour praise is leaving me a little embarrassed... However, it also means that my acting performance as Dwayne Dant\u00e8s is effective. At the very least, everyone knows that he's a middle-aged gentleman with foresight and competence, with plenty of money that he has nowhere to invest... Hmm, considering the original 16,493 pounds and Miss Magician's 5,000, no-6,000 pounds, as well as the 48 pounds provided by Mr. X, I have a total of 22,991 pounds and 5 gold coins. Even if I deduct the 5,987 pounds I owe Miss Messenger, I'll be considered a true tycoon... Many people with assets worth a hundred thousand pounds might not have that much liquidity...Klein couldn't help but do a count of his wealth as he asked with a smile, \"Ma'am, what do you wish for me to do?\"\nMary sipped some tea and said eloquently, \"Acquire the 3% shares. But before that, I'll sign two contracts with you. The first contract stipulates that I'll forcefully purchase the shares from you in three months and buy it at the highest price over this period of time. The corresponding tax will be shouldered by me. The second contract stipulates that we act in concert...\n\"In addition, I will make you a member of the board of directors for the Coim Company. You will enjoy the corresponding perks as you monitor the company's development. This will help you be integrated even better into high society.\"\nSounds like a sure-win. It's equivalent to me providing a loan, and Ma'am Mary will repay me with a certain amount of interest and social resources... And compared to a debt agreement, I'll be holding onto the shares of an excellent company. It's more secure; after all, we are considered strangers... Of course, that's under the premise that the Coim Company itself is alright. Hmm, this is also why she's making me a director...Klein analyzed the conditions proposed by Ma'am Mary and slowly felt enticed by them.\nFrom his point of view, Dwayne Dant\u00e8s needed some investments. Otherwise, he would appear suspicious. Then, selecting the kind of investment was a rather important problem since it had to be considered that Dwayne Dant\u00e8s might have to give up everything and leave Backlund because of his operation's failure or success.\nWhen the time comes, there's a chance to take away the money, but I can forget about the shares... This kind of investment, one that allows me to quickly recoup my investment, meets my requirements... I might even earn quite a bit...Klein contemplated for a moment before warmly smiling.\n\"Helping a lady resolve problems is something that I need to do.\"\nMa'am Mary immediately felt relieved. Just as she was about to say something, she heard Dwayne Dant\u00e8s's attractive voice continue:\n\"However, I'm rather cautious in regards to any investments I make.\n\"I will hire a lawyer and an accounting team to investigate the Coim Company's situation. I'll try to reach a conclusion as quickly as possible, and if there aren't any problems, we can begin our cooperation.\"\nAside from that, I will also do a divination...Klein silently added inwardly.\n\"Definitely.\" Ma'am Mary smiled and added, \"I'll bear the costs for such expenses.\"\nKlein didn't reject the offer as he nodded and said, \"How much would the 3% shares cost?\"\n\"The current valuation is 9,600 pounds, but the shareholder believes that the Coim Company has a promising future, so it can't be lower than 12,000 pounds.\" Mary gave him the exact details.\nPhew...Klein used a calm and relaxed manner to smile.\n\"That's still alright.\"\nDwayne Dant\u00e8s is indeed rich...Mary thought as she said, \"Dwayne, can I invite you to visit the Coim Company tomorrow?\"\n\"That's exactly what I wish for,\" Klein replied with a smile.\nAt the same time, he couldn't help but think of something. His former landlord, Stelyn Sammer's husband, was likely still a manager at Coim Company.\nYet another familiar face, but it's not one for Dwayne Dant\u00e8s...Klein felt wistful for some baffling reason.\n...\nAt 8 p.m. there were still crowds of people entering East Borough from the other streets. Fatigue obviously colored their faces.\nAnd this continued almost until ten.\nEmlyn White had changed into a grayish-blue worker's attire, wore a cap, and hid himself in the alley of the Backlund Bridge area while observing the poor that sauntered back and forth.\nAlthough he didn't have any experience in disguising himself, he had eyes and brains. Just a short observation was enough for him to discover the problems with his attire.\nThe most important point was that, compared to the poor who had dirty and ragged clothes, the work attire he had bought in the afternoon was too new and clean, easily attracting the attention of others.\nEmlyn thought for a moment, returned to the dark alley, and reached out his fingers. Using what he had seen, he began tearing open the areas that were easily damaged.\nThen, he observed his surroundings as his facial muscles gradually distorted into a grimace.\nWith a look of contempt, Emlyn came to the wall, closed his eyes, and began dabbing the dirt onto his clothes and pants.\nThe smell of coal... the smell of rotting mud... the smell of p-p*ss...Emlyn subconsciously extended his palm away from himself as he covered his mouth with his other hand. He nearly vomited.\nAt this moment, he realized that having an extraordinary sense of smell wasn't necessarily a good thing.\nAfter a few minutes of excruciating torture, Emlyn finally finished his disguise. Even his handsome face was stained with coal.\nWith this disguise, he hunched his back, and slipped into the crowd, quickly entering East Borough without garnering any attention.\nAs he walked, Emlyn realized a problem.\nHe wasn't familiar with the roads at all!\nHe had no idea where Limestone Street or Beluga Whale Street was in East Borough, while most of the street signs had already been damaged.\nAn assassination attempt really is a troublesome matter...Emlyn mumbled as he began asking around for directions.\nAfter nearly an hour of hard work, he finally arrived at Limestone Street. The streets were narrow, with the buildings on both sides leaning close to each other. Even in the day, it appeared dark. At night, it gave off a terrifying sense of creepiness and darkness. But to the Sanguine, such an environment wasn't bad. The only problem was the dirt and messiness.\nAfter spraying a medicine that eliminated his scent, Emlyn walked into the condominium at Unit 6, went to the third story, and approached the public washroom with his nose pinched before standing outside the room of Primordial Moon believer, Argos.\nEmlyn cocked his ears to listen for a while before he stopped pinching his nose in puzzlement.\nHe nearly fainted from the stench wafting over from the washroom. It took him a great bit of effort to focus his gaze on the room.\nHis sense of smell told him that there wasn't anyone inside, nor were there any corpses.\nHe moved away? Or he isn't back?Emlyn muttered silently in a daze.\nHe never expected his hunt to be so unsuccessful.\nAfter reining in his emotions, Emlyn left the condominium and rushed to 19 Beluga Whale Street.\nThis time, he was delighted to discover that someone was home. Galis Kevin was home.\nAt that moment, Emlyn caught the scent of another person. It was very identical to Argos's apartment at Limestone Street.\nTwo people... There are two people in the room! Argos isn't home because he came to Galis Kevin... Two...Emlyn's expression suddenly froze.\nHe wasn't worried if it was one-on-one. But if it was one against two, he was still a little fearful with Leymano's Travels. After all, the two of them were artificial vampires with rather significant strength!"}
{"num_chp":613,"summary":"Loen Kingdom, East Chester County, Stoen City.\nHaving left the manor, Audrey moved into a villa. After she finished engaging in social gatherings with the local nobles, she sent her servant to the Varvat Bank to withdraw a sum of cash.\nShe didn't need to worry about this any further. She could easily pay off the 2,000 pounds she owed Mr. Fool's Blessed, and she could also pay the 1,800 pounds she owed Mr. World for the Psychiatrist characteristic.\nFifteen minutes later, Audrey opened the room to her bedroom and glanced at her personal maidservant, Annie, who was monitoring the servants while they did their work. She looked down at the golden retriever who was sitting by the side of the wall and smiled. With a smile, she suppressed her voice and asked with shining eyes, \"Susie, you'll receive a gift in a while. Are you looking forward to it?\"\nIf it were in the past, Audrey would've definitely said, \"Susie, your present is here,\" making the golden retriever realize that she could find the actual item in the room as well. Otherwise, it was very easy for Susie, who had been studying the basics of mysticism, to guess that Audrey had used ritualistic magic.\nWith this new sentence structure, the situation could have Audrey receive a mysterious letter or news in her bedroom to confirm that the gift was about to be delivered. There would be too many possibilities as a result of this.\nSusie could read the joy and sincere attitude deep inside Audrey's heart as she subconsciously opened her mouth, hoping to stir the air to produce a voice. She had wanted to inquire about the gift, but she sharply sensed that Audrey's personal maid, Annie, was approaching. The alert Suzie abandoned her original thoughts.\nShe returned to the state of being an ordinary dog as she slowly wagged her tail to express her joy and anticipation.\nAfter making an excuse to head out, Audrey entered a \"chemistry laboratory\" that she had specially marked out for herself. She placed the Psychiatrist characteristic and supplementary ingredients on the table.\n\"Susie, do you still remember the potion-concocting process?\" She cleared her throat and straightened her back as she excitedly played the role of a teacher.\n\"Woof, I remember!\" Susie already knew what her present was. In her joy, she barked.\nAudrey added, \"Try to concoct it by yourself.\"\nSusie looked down at her paws and suddenly fell silent.\nAudrey was taken aback before a brief silence ensued.\nA few seconds later, before the golden retriever could speak, Audrey covered her mouth without any atypical response and giggled.\n\"Alright, Susie, there's no need to say a word. I know what you wish to say. You wish to express the fact that you're only a dog and am unable to concoct the potion, right?\"\nHow embarrassing...At the same time, Audrey, who wore a charming and graceful external bearing, facepalmed herself inwardly.\n\"Woof!\" Susie nodded forcefully.\nAudrey took the opportunity and turned around. Soon, she finished concocting the Psychiatrist potion.\nShe had previously asked Susie and learned that she had already finished digesting the potion on Wednesday.\nThat's less than two months... Yes, a large reason has to do with how Susie isn't being noticed. She can run about anywhere in the manor or villa and eavesdrop, allowing her to read the true thoughts of the maidservants... That's good as well. She will always share the tidbits with me. If not for her, I wouldn't have known of the dark sides of many people who appear normal and kind usually...Audrey poured the potion into a bowl and placed it on the floor.\nShe watched as Susie went over and began licking the potion as she couldn't curb the anticipation in her heart.\nSusie might be influenced by the potion and become unstable.\nBut it's alright. Psychiatrist Miss Audrey is already prepared to use Placate at any moment! Yes, I prefer the name Psychoanalysis. That sounds more professional.\nAudrey stared at Susie with her beautiful emerald-like eyes with great seriousness and discovered that Susie's pupils were gradually fading and turning vertical. Dark gold scales seemed to grow beneath her thick fur, and the spirituality that belonged to Susie kept radiating outwards as though it was interweaving with the entire villa's space.\nAfter calming her somewhat nervous emotions, Audrey scrutinized Susie's state. As long as something abnormal happened to Susie, she would immediately use the Beyonder power, Psychoanalysis.\nSuddenly, Susie's voice sounded out in her ears.\n\"Audrey, I'm done!\"\n\"...\"\nAudrey was temporarily at a loss on what to say.\n...\nIn her dream, Daisy returned to East Borough and to the old apartment she had lived in for years.\nShe pushed open the door and saw her mother, Liz, and her sister, Freja, doing the laundry diligently.\nDaisy instantly became delighted and was just about to join them. She was in charge of ironing the laundry.\nAt this moment, she heard knocking at the door.\nShe turned her head and realized that the visitor was a young man in a black-and-white checkered police uniform.\nThe officer had black hair and green eyes, with a somewhat blurry face. He held a notebook and fountain pen as he asked, \"In the Capim case, apart from what you mentioned, is there anything else you didn't mention to us?\"\n\"It's all nothing important,\" Daisy answered in a rather groggy manner.\nThe handsome officer looked down at his notebook and said, \"It's fine. I'm willing to listen.\"\nDaisy looked back at the clothes which were hung up, feeling as though she had forgotten some instructions.\nShe honestly described all sorts of trivialities. In the end, she said, \"... After I was abducted, my mother and sister had hired a private detective to search for me. His name is Mr. Sherlock Moriarty. He's a good man. Although he didn't find me directly, he later contacted a reporter to help me get compensated with the foundation money...\"\nThe black-haired and green-eyed officer looked up again and glanced at Daisy before revealing a warm smile.\n\"Very good. Your answer is very satisfactory.\n\"Do you still remember the private detective's appearance?\"\nDaisy nodded. Without any alarm, she saw Mr. Sherlock Moriarty standing beside her.\nThe detective had grown a thick beard and wore gold-rimmed glasses. It was almost identical to the one in her memories.\nAfter the black-haired, green-eyed officer sized up the image a few times, he seemed to vanish at some point in time without Daisy realizing it. For some reason, her mother and sister had also vanished.\nShe ran through East Borough in search of the familiar figures, but she ultimately woke up from her depression and sorrow. When she saw the dark ceiling of her school dormitory, she lay there in a daze for seconds.\nDaisy didn't make a sound as she turned her body and buried half her face into the pillow.\nBy the corners of the pillow, a wet stain gradually spread out.\nThe person who had entered Daisy's dream was none other than Leonard Mitchell. Although his investigation of the commonalities of the two cases was to give him time to deal with matters of his own, he didn't forget to act in a perfunctory manner. In the end, he really discovered a problem.\nIn the cases of Lanevus and Capim, a private detective named Sherlock Moriarty was involved, including his friend, Reporter Mike Joseph... Although they had only appeared on the outskirts of this matter, it's also a direction for the investigation. heh, that Sherlock Moriarty looks somewhat familiar. Which fugitive is he?Leonard recalled what he had seen in the dream as he wore his red glove and entered the basement of Saint Samuel Cathedral.\nJust as he greeted the team captain, Soest, he saw a partner approach and hand him two thin sheets of paper.\n\"The information regarding the red-eyed man from the Harvest Church is all here.\"\n\"Thank you. Do you want to have lunch together?\" Leonard asked with a smile.\nThe Nighthawk shrugged and said, \"No, as long as you stop making me have nightmares.\"\n\"Deal.\" Leonard smiled as he received the dossier.\nHe stood there without being in a hurry to sit down as he casually browsed through it.\n\"Emlyn White. A vampire. Currently under the jurisdiction of the Church of Earth Mother... He once vanished for a period of time. His parents had hired private detectives to find him. Thanks to a particular Mr. Stuart, this matter was ultimately resolved by the famous detective, Sherlock Moriarty.\"\nLeonard's smile gradually froze as his expression turned serious.\nSherlock Moriarty?he repeated this name in his mind.\n...\nKlein wasn't in a rush to find an opportunity to engage in true acting. He toured Oravi Island's port city with the mindset of a tourist, finding a brief and rare moment of relaxation in his tense life.\nThis city had mostly immigrants from Loen. The cuisine wasn't much different from the east coast of the kingdom, with the only difference being that there were rare fruits and all sorts of seafood here. It was also quite a unique trait of the city.\nThis place was rich in natural resources and was located in a key location on the safe sea routes. The standard of living was pretty good. Even the farmers in the suburbs could save up some money through their fruit gardens.\nThis didn't mean that Oravi didn't have poor people or the lower-class. This class was mainly made up of people who were former slaves. Loen's parliament had long abolished slavery.\nAfter chewing a juicy and sweet fruit, Klein watched the sky turn dark. He took a turn at the corner of the street and entered a bar named Sweet Lemon.\nIt was a famous gathering place for adventurers in Oravi. Klein planned on buying the two remaining supplementary ingredients of a Nimblewright Master-the relatively common drago tree bark and Sonia Golden Spring water.\nAt this moment, the bar was rather lively. There were many people holding up cups around the boxing ring as they cheered loudly. There were people who looked like adventurers at the surrounding tables. They were discussing all kinds of rumors in hushed tones.\nJust as Klein was squeezing towards the bar counter, he suddenly heard his name.\n\"... I'm Gehrman Sparrow. You should know who I am. I received a treasure map and need to hire some helpers. It's not because I'm afraid, but it's because I can't carry that much treasure alone...\" A green-eyed man in his thirties held half a glass of liquor and spoke to two men and two women in the corner. It was a mystery if they were merchants or adventurers.\nYou are also named Gehrman Sparrow? Treasure map Why does it sound like a scam... My killing of Wormtongue has already reached this place from Bayam? Yes, it was likely communicated via a telegram or visitors. Therefore, many people know of my name and deeds but do not know what I look like... Cheats are using this opportunity to pass themselves off as me to cheat others...Klein moved over as he came to a realization.\nThe green-eyed man drank a mouthful of liquor and slammed the glass onto the table.\n\"I don't mind whether you refuse or agree, but I hate it when people make me wait!\n\"Do you wish to be like Wormtongue?\"\nThe young man opposite him said slightly intimidated, \"I know you're a powerful adventurer...\"\n\"So?\" The green-eyed man cut off the man's words.\nAt that moment, he felt his collar tighten as he was lifted up by someone and thrown out the door.\nKlein didn't provide an explanation as he directly threw the man out of the door with a stoic expression.\nThen, he drew his revolver and aimed it at the spot where the man had fallen to the ground. He pulled the trigger without any hesitation.\nBang!\nJust as the green-eyed man fell to the ground, he saw a spark light up at the ground near his crotch. He was so frightened that he swallowed back his cursing and scrambled away.\nWithout any explanation, his weak performance proved that he wasn't Gehrman Sparrow.\nKlein ignored the victim who stood there in a daze. He politely blew at the mouth of his revolver before stuffing it back into his underarm holster.\nFollowing that, he walked slowly to the bar counter in the resulting silent atmosphere."}
{"num_chp":718,"summary":"Not finding himself overly exhausted, Klein rubbed his temples and beckoned over a tiny metallic bottle from the junk pile.\nInside it was a tiny tube of blood that he went through great effort to extract from his vein, and he had long brought it above the gray fog. It was only waiting for the opportunity when Klein would use his Spirit Body to enter Groselle's Travels to explore the book world.\nAfter opening the cap, Klein wasn't in a hurry to smear the blood over the book's dark brown cover. Instead, he summoned all the items from the junk pile that he had brought to the mysterious space before the Tarot Gathering, and he spread them out in front of him.\nIn consideration of how the Black Emperor's form was too eye-catching, and with him not too certain of the exact situation in the book world, Klein decided against bringing the Card of Blasphemy. Instead, he used Azik's copper whistle to fortify his Spirit Body to prevent himself from failing to return above the gray fog before being instantly killed by some unknown power.\nAs the ancient and exquisite copper whistle fused into his body, Klein's Spirit Body swelled up and became more corporeal.\nTwo pitch-black flames flared out from his eye sockets as though they possessed a life of their own.\nWith the help of Cogitation, he adjusted his spirituality, converging the iciness that stemmed from the aspect of Death within his body. Soon, his eyes returned to normal.\nThis was like an evil spirit taking on an ordinary form to lure prey into its proximity.\nRight on the heels of that, Klein wore Creeping Hunger and held Death Knell while he hid the Nightmare Beyonder characteristic in his body. The latter was prepared for him to seek out any abnormalities when exploring the dreams of the living entities in the book world.\nAfter completing all his preparations, he poured a few drops of blood and smeared it over the cover of Groselle's Travels.\nAfter a brief wait, his vision turned blurry, as though countless translucent objects were hidden within it. Following that, it turned clear-there were blue skies, white clouds, grayish-brown city walls, and passersby.\nThis is no longer the land of ice and snow from before, but a city that looks very normal on the surface...Klein stood by the side of the dirt road as he observed the residents of the book world. He discovered that most of them wore linen shirts, a short brown coat, and loose dark-colored trousers. Their overall style was akin to that of the Loen Kingdom centuries ago.\nHe looked down at the format of the tailcoat, starched shirt, and damaged dark-red bow tie as he silently changed it all out. Instantly, he was no different from the people around him.\nHe then walked to the city gates in preparation to enter.\nAt that moment, a leather-vested soldier at the gate stopped him.\n\"Entrance fees! One liddle.\"\nDo I look rich? I don't even know what a liddle is...Klein mumbled inwardly, amused. He then \"communicated\" with him at a spiritual level, successfully transferring the soldier's attention onto a merchant caravan behind him.\nAs a quasi-wraith who could possess anyone and control them, exerting a psychological influence on others was nothing extraordinary. It wasn't a particularly potent ability, but it was extremely useful against ordinary people.\nWhen Klein entered the city, he walked through the streets in a seemingly relaxed manner, but he inwardly remained wary. He felt that public hygiene was slightly better than Backlund a few years ago. It appeared to have a mature sewage system, preventing the situation of any waste and trash being dumped.\nI couldn't tell that this is an illusory world inside a book at all. Everyone has Spirit Body Threads...Klein proceeded forward as he observed. Suddenly, he noticed a stone building that was more than ten meters tall to his side. It only had two stories, and the top of the door was about four meters tall.\nBeside the building was a signboard. It was written in a language that was completely different from any of the outside world's languages, but Klein instantly understood what it meant: \"Pessote Blacksmith Guild.\"\nThere's a blacksmith guild. This place really hasn't entered the Age of Steam...Just as Klein was feeling poignant, he saw the door creak open, and out walked a giant with four long limbs!\nThe giant's skin was grayish blue, and his head had the trademark single vertical eye. In his hand was a huge and heavy sledgehammer. He walked across the street with his lips curled.\nThe humans walking past him didn't show any fear, as though it was a common sight.\nThey even greeted the giant.\n\"Good afternoon, Groselle!\"\nGroselle...Klein, who was rather face-blind to giants, had his pupils constrict. Only then did he realize the familiarity!\nHe was just about to chase after them when he discovered that the giant had turned into another street, vanishing from his sights.\nKlein stood on the spot, silently observing the intersection as he came up with a few guesses.\nThere's another Groselle in the book world?\nNo, the ending of the travels is that Groselle died in battle in the Nation of Frost...\nThis is another story?\nFilled with all kinds of questions, Klein wasn't in a rush to find Groselle. He turned and entered a bar by the side of the street.\nSuch places were often the places with the most messy and multifarious information in a city. It aided him in quickly gaining a grasp of the entire situation.\nThe bar's lighting was dim, and the ventilation wasn't the best, making the air appear somewhat turbid. At that moment, there weren't many customers drinking. Most of the people were by the bar counter, chatting happily with each other or the bartender.\nKlein slowly walked over when his gaze froze.\nHe saw a man wearing a black pointed hat and an asymmetrical coat by the side of the bar counter. He looked pretty handsome with his flaxen-colored hair, deep brown eyes, a high nose, and thin lips. He was none other than the Solomon Empire viscount, Mobet Zoroast!\nUpon seeing him, Klein recalled the scene of the Dream Stealer's rapid aging before he collapsed onto the ground as he struggled to crawl towards Elvish Songster Siatas and grabbed her hand.\nAll of that remained clear as day, as though it had just happened yesterday; yet, Mobet had once again appeared before his eyes.\nKlein's expression grew heavy as he walked over and sat beside Mobet.\nHe didn't say a word, as he knew that Mobet was one to start a conversation.\n\"Outsider, first time in Pessote? I swear I've never met you before.\" Mobet put down a cup of distilled liquor as he turned his head to the side.\n\"I come from the Nation of Frost.\" Klein randomly cooked up a story.\nMobet immediately laughed loudly.\n\"You're a funny one. This is the Nation of Frost, but of course, that was many years ago.\n\"Ever since the King of the North was killed by a bunch of adventurers, no-heroes, this place is no longer plagued by ice and snow. Everyone believes that it should be called the Nation of Neverwinter.\"\nKlein fell silent without responding.\n\"Why so serious? It looks like you have your own troubles.\" Mobet rapped on the wooden bar counter, showing signs of sympathy. He downed a mouthful of spirits and said, \"I'm telling you. Men should absolutely not get married. It's the beginning of suffering! Do you know? When she gets worked up a little, she would beat me up. When she's happy, she beats me up. Same when she's embarrassed or angry! Anyway, she beats me up for any reason! From this very moment, I've decided not to return home again!\"\nDoes this mean you got married to Siatas?Klein kept silent for two seconds as he sized up Mobet's face. He discovered that there were no signs of bruises and swelling on his face. This meant that the Elvish Songster knew that men needed to put on appearances.\nHe asked with a sigh, \"Then why did you marry her?\"\nMobet was taken aback as he smiled wryly.\n\"I came here with a merchant caravan. When I first saw her, she was just that beautiful. Her singing was moving and seemed to hide indescribable sorrow. Heh, I'm as afraid of her now as I was infatuated over her back then! I definitely won't return. Hey, why do you seem a little sad? You don't have to be sad for me. I'm already free!\"\nAt that moment, the door to the bar suddenly opened as a beautiful female voice shouted.\n\"Mobet, come out here!\n\"I'm counting from ten. Never come back if you don't come home!\n\"Ten, nine...\"\nMobet immediately jumped up and ran to the door. As he ran, he muttered, \"I know you don't have any patience. You always jump to two after counting to eight!\"\nKlein turned his body and saw Siatas's figure, but he no longer had the intention of communicating with her.\nThe real Mobet and Siatas were already dead. The ones living in the book world were just two characters.\nStanding up and leaving the bar, Klein came to a nearby deserted alley. He planned on confirming the kind of spirit world this world had.\nHe quickly outlined spherical lights in his mind as his thoughts gradually emptied out and his body and mind became tranquil.\nAs his spirituality spread out bit by bit, several indescribable illusory figures appeared around him. However, up high in the sky, it lacked the seven lustrous brilliances of different colors that contained endless knowledge.\nThe seven lights don't exist here... The number of spirit world creatures here are lacking... This place is indeed a fake spirit world created by the book...Klein took a step forward and found the colors in his vision saturate to the extreme as it overlapped with the obvious differences.\nHe wasn't in a rush to explore the spirit world. He exited it and began window shopping through Pessote and chatted with others.\nBefore long, he found Groselle's residence.\nThe giant ran a blacksmith shop. He was taking an afternoon nap on a huge bed on the second story.\nKlein directly entered by passing through the wall and came to Groselle's side.\nHe observed the giant for a few seconds and took out the Nightmare Beyonder characteristic from his Spirit Body. With some difficulty, he used some of its powers that it came naturally equipped with.\nDeep, serene darkness quickly spread as it instantly enveloped Klein and Groselle. And in a Spirit Body state, Klein directly saw a blob of irregular hazy spherical light.\nHis spirituality immediately emanated over and touched the spherical light.\nAll sorts of scattered scenes instantly flashed past around him before fixating on a forest with towering but withered trees. On the other side of the forest was a mountain and steep cliffs. At the top of it was a magnificent palace.\nThe palace was huge and opulent, and it didn't seem suitable for humans. It gave him the impression like it was from a myth as the light of dusk that scattered above it seemed frozen.\nKlein had seen this palace before. It was the Giant King's Court that had appeared in the dream world of the battlefield of the gods!\nHowever, this angle was completely different from before. He was situated behind the king's court!"}
{"num_chp":1271,"summary":"Upon hearing Indigo Light Iesus's reply, Klein's mind tensed up as he recalled the crimson moon, the Brown Planet, the Scarlet Planet, the Blue Planet, and Gold Planet. He felt like they were looking down at him from above with their eyes.\nSilently, a connection was established. The impending fatal corruption made all of Klein's Worms of Spirit feel uneasy.\nAs an angel in control of Sefirah Castle, Klein had many ways to sever this connection. Firstly, he could use the status and strength of a complete Mythical Creature. Secondly, he could suppress his anchors, using the mental imprint the Primordial One left in him to offset it. Thirdly, he could use the aura of Sefirah Castle that he could now utilize one step further.\nWithout any hesitation, he chose the simplest and most convenient method to not leave behind any hidden dangers.\nA grayish-white fog appeared around him as all the celestial body projections in his mind vanished.\nAfter being stunned for a second, Klein organized his words and said, \"There are that many Outer Deities?\"\nIndigo Light Iesus symbolized the domain of prayers. \"He\" touched the ruby ring on \"His\" right hand and nodded.\n\"Ever since the Oldest One awakened and split apart, the most powerful Outer Deities in the entire Universe gathered around this tiny solar system. Some of \u2018Them' wish to retrieve \u2018Their' sefirot and characteristics that had been ripped from \u2018Them,' and were attracted here. Some of \u2018Them' have the hope of getting neighboring sefirot and high-level characteristics which \u2018They' can accommodate.\"\nOldest One... The Seven Lights address the original Creator as the Oldest One, and not the Primordial One... In terms of the name's meaning, there isn't much difference... Klein deliberated and asked, \"Sefirot and characteristics that were ripped and attracted over?\"\nHe could understand the rest of the words Indigo Light had mentioned, and he had even made some speculation towards such matters. There was just one point that caught him by surprise.\nBlue Light Kuthumi, who was a symbol of the domain of Cogitation and used love and wisdom as a characteristic of \"His\" body, explained kindly, \"Your Excellency, you shouldn't be unfamiliar with the law of convergence of Beyonder characteristics.\"\nSeeing Klein nod, the thick-bearded elder with a \"sapphire\" tied around his forehead continued, \"This isn't just a law for the Sequence pathways. It's also suitable for describing the sefirot and the characteristics related to the Outer Deities, especially the ones that were directly nurtured and created from the Oldest One. For example, the Mother Goddess of Depravity, Son of Chaos, and the Mother Tree of Desire. As for the other Outer Deities, we aren't too sure. In short, the three Great Old Ones who lost a portion of their sefirot and characteristics are most concerned and proactive when it comes to invading the real world. \u2018They' have been trying to influence the spirit world and corrupt us.\"\nKlein nodded slightly and asked in a confirmation-seeking tone, \"In other words, a portion of the current twenty-two pathways and nine sefirot belong to the Outer Deities?\"\n\"Yes.\" The amethyst-wielding Saint Germain, who symbolized the domain of ritualistic magic, took the opportunity to answer. \"When the total number of 22 pathways and the nine sefirot was reached, everything finally reached a balance. This might be the mysticism connection that originated from the Oldest One.\"\nKlein thought for a moment before saying, \"What are they exactly?\"\nSaint Germain. whose face was suffused with a faint purple glow, making \"Him\" look rather mysterious, said, \"For example, the Moon and the Earth pathway both belong to the Mother Goddess of Depravity. \u2018She' is an existence that stands atop all the Outer Deities. Even after a portion of \u2018Her' sefirah-that is, the Brood Hive-was ripped from \u2018Her,' that remains the case. \u2018She' is the sovereign of all the feminine forces in the entire Universe.\"\nJust as Saint Germain said that, Green Light Serapis suddenly laughed.\n\"In fact, after carefully analyzing the twenty-two pathways, you'll discover that the Moon and Earth pathways are the two most contradictory ones. Heh heh, the Demoness pathway represents the Oldest One's feminine side. The Red Priest pathway represents the masculine side. This happens to form a deformed aspect of balance, but the Moon and Earth can also make Beyonders of the corresponding pathways turn into feminine creatures at high Sequences. There are no pathways that balance it.\"\nSeeing Klein wince his eyebrows, Green Light, who had the long hair of an artist, added with a smile, \"The Earth pathway's Sequence 2 is \u2018Desolate Matriarch,' and the Moon pathway's Sequence 1 is called \u2018Beauty Goddess.' Therefore, the Sanguine only have queens and no male princes.\"\nThen was the ancient goddess, Lilith, originally a male and a female? Klein mumbled inwardly and asked thoughtfully, \"The Primordial Moon is the Mother Goddess of Depravity?\"\n\"Yes.\" Red Light Aiur Moria, who was wearing a diamond crown, nodded in a dignified manner. \"\u2018She' occupies the moon, and through \u2018Her' own level and influence on the Brood Hive and the Uniqueness of two pathways, \u2018She' has gradually infiltrated into reality. The Primordial Moon is \u2018Her' manifestation in this world.\"\nAfter saying that, Aiur Moria paused and said, \"\u2018Her' full title is \u2018Mother Goddess of Depravity,' \u2018Origin of Evil,' The Indestructible,' and the \u2018Brood Hive of Filth.'\"\nKlein recalled the exaggerated reaction of the moon when he first learned of the secret of the cosmos. He suddenly felt a chill as he hurriedly asked, \"The Devil and Prisoner pathway come from the Mother Tree of Desire?\"\nYellow Light Venithan, who was wearing a lemon-yellow robe, sighed.\n\"Yes, \u2018Her' full name is the \u2018Mother Tree of Desire,' \u2018Father to Devils,' \u2018Perpetual Blatherer,' and the \u2018Heartless God.' Therefore, \u2018She' had seized the opportunity when something happened to the Chained God, easily achieving \u2018Her' goal of corruption.\"\nMother... Father... Is that fellow a man or a woman... Yes, to an existence at this level, it's normal for there to be no distinction between genders. Different incarnations have different images... Heh, \u2018She' even wanted to bear a child for me. From the present state of the Chained God, if I had been caught, I'd probably be the one bearing the child. Then, the child will inherit Sefirah Castle, allowing the Mother Tree of Desire to indirectly corrupt and control this sefirah...\nFrom this angle, perhaps the Prisoner pathway's desire of indulgence is the proper way of acting. However, this \"correct\" path leads to the Outer Deity, so temperance is still the better one... Klein frowned slightly as he raised a question he had guessed before, hoping to get an answer.\n\"Since there are so many Outer Deities, why haven't \u2018They' entered our world yet?\"\nFrom what Klein had learned to date, he could guess that, even if it were only the Mother Goddess of Depravity and the Mother Tree of Desire, the Outer Deities could easily resolve existences like the former seven deities, the True Creator, and the Primordial Demoness.\nThe plump Orange Light Hilarion smiled and said, \"All our suffering comes from the Oldest One. All our luck comes from the Oldest One as well.\n\"Not only did \u2018He' leave behind \u2018His' spirit, will, branding, and corruption, but \u2018He' also left behind the sefirot, characteristics, and power.\n\"The remnants of \u2018His' power formed an invisible barrier outside the planet, preventing the Outer Deities from directly invading it. However, with the passage of time, \u2018His' consciousness and powers haven't truly been revived, and \u2018His' will and powers are fading. At the end of the Fourth Epoch, this reached a very serious state. The invisible barrier produced cracks, and the seven deities had no choice but to move \u2018Their' divine kingdoms into the astral world to mend the cracks.\nIt's no wonder that the true deities from the Fourth Epoch could walk the land, but \"They\" rarely descended in the Fifth Epoch... Klein immediately came to a realization and asked, \"When the Oldest One's will and powers decline further, the invisible barrier will vanish and usher in the apocalypse?\"\nOrange Light Hilarion, who had been smiling all this while, glanced at Yellow Light Venithan. His expression immediately turned serious.\n\"Yes.\"\nWhen the time comes, the Mother Goddess of Depravity, the Mother Tree of Desire, and the Son of Chaos and all the other Outer Deities would invade this planet. Even if the Goddess becomes a Great Old One, \"She\" wouldn't be able to withstand so many of \"Them\"... The other Sequence 0 deities would be able to tie down one or two Outer Deities together, and that would be considered a miracle... It would take nine to fight one, or even more... Klein's scalp tingled as he once again experienced the meaning of despair.\nNo wonder it was called the apocalypse!\nWith his upheaval in emotions, he immediately felt the Primordial One's mental imprint strengthen, and more of it had eroded what the anchors had fixed in place.\nKlein quickly calmed himself down and allowed the fragile balance to reappear again.\nThis is the reason why the corruption from underground will naturally dissipate as long as one doesn't approach it or resist? Klein recalled some of the mysticism knowledge he had previously grasped.\n\"Your Excellency, you're completely right.\" Orange Light Hilarion gave an affirmative answer.\nKlein immediately made other connections.\n\"Does that mean that the closer one is to the apocalypse, the easier it is for one to advance? This is because the Primordial One's will is fading. \u2018His' awakening will become difficult, to the point of not waking up again?\"\nRed Light, Aiur Moria thought for a moment and said, \"This is the reason why the seven deities have only waited until recently to set \u2018Their' sights on Above the Sequences before taking concrete action.\n\"However, the Oldest One's will can dissipate, but \u2018His' spirit will remain forever. It won't be erased unless the entire Universe returns to the singularity. Therefore, the corresponding high-level existences still have the possibility of having the Oldest One awaken in \u2018Them.' The higher the level, the greater the possibility. The corresponding influence and corruption will become more serious.\"\nThe extraordinary power and the curse that can never be broken are always two sides of the same coin... Klein sighed. Forcefully suppressing a problem that wasn't at his level, he asked, \"Do you know the potion formula for Attendant of Mysteries?\"\nThe amethyst-wielding Saint Germain replied, \"There's a corresponding mystery attached to such knowledge. It's not in the spirit world, but according to our observations, the Attendant of Mysteries ritual should be closely related to the spirit world.\"\nOrange Light Hilarion immediately smiled at Klein.\n\"Your Excellency, if you require anything, we'll provide our full support.\"\nThis fervor makes me a little afraid, just like facing Arrodes... Klein nodded slightly and prepared to change the topic.\nAfter some consideration, he asked solemnly, \"Do you know of \u2018The Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth for Blessings'?\"\nHe translated the title using Elvish.\nThe Seven Lights immediately fell silent. \"They\" looked at each other and didn't reply for a while.\nAfter a few seconds, Orange Light Hilarion sighed.\n\"We still can't be sure if you're \u2018Him.'\n\"\u2018He' was a Great Old One who had been active during the end of the previous civilization up to the mid-stages of the First Epoch. \u2018He' is \u2018the great ruler above the spirit world' that we speak of.\n\"The Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth for Blessings is \u2018His' title in the Western Continent. The other title is \u2018King of Space-Time,' \u2018Beacon of Destiny,' \u2018Embodiment of Sefirah Castle,' \u2018Dominator of the Spirit World,' and...\"\nAt this point, Orange Light paused and said, \"Lord of the Mysteries.\""}
{"num_chp":334,"summary":"The only candle flickered its yellow flame, casting shadows on the walls around the activity room.\nKlein found the most convenient escape point before surveying his surroundings. He saw the Eye of Wisdom with his deep cheek lines and the plump Apothecary.\nWell, after another comparison, even though he's wearing an iron mask that covers half his face, it's still pretty clear that he was the man I met at Rice Circus who deserves a beating...Klein looked away and waited for the gathering to officially begin. The woman who had an Artisan backing her was very hidden among the participants, so he couldn't be sure that she was present before she spoke.\nAfter a few minutes, Eye of Wisdom raised his head to look at the mechanical clock on the wall and chuckled.\n\"There's a lot of people here today.\"\n\"Let's begin.\"\nBefore he finished speaking, the plump Apothecary rushed to speak.\n\"I need a Beyonder creature for an experiment. It's best if it's an animal, and it's best if it's already restrained and one that's not too dangerous.\"\nA beast-type Beyonder creature?Klein was slightly moved.\nHe remembered what the Apothecary had said in the circus theater and that he was apparently able to read the thoughts of beasts.\nHe's just an Apothecary; yet, he poses such an ability and is even looking to purchase a beast-type Beyonder creature. Hmm, after I sold him the Spring of Elves marrow crystal, he should've gathered the ingredients and advanced to the next Sequence... In other words, the Sequence after Apothecary has something to do directing wild beasts?Klein made a deduction based on the information he knew.\nAt this moment, someone responded to the Apothecary with a sneer, \"Who would keep a Beyonder creature by their side?\n\"It's dangerous and easily discovered. Wouldn't it be easier and more concealed to kill them to obtain its Beyonder ingredients?\"\nThe Apothecary was a person who refused to lose in a spar of words, so he immediately sneered.\n\"What a foolish thought!\n\"You can't guarantee that the Beyonder ingredient on a Beyonder creature is exactly what you need and that you can definitely sell it. You might as well tame it and direct it to be your helper, increasing your strength severalfold...\"\nAs he spoke, his voice gradually grew softer. He felt as if he had revealed some important secret.\nDamn it! Why can't I control this mouth of mine!The Apothecary figuratively smacked himself in the heart.\nAs expected...Klein nodded indiscernibly.\nWithout a doubt, the Apothecary's request wasn't met. Most of the participants here were Low-Sequence Beyonders, and their statuses in Backlund weren't very prominent. With the need for them to be relatively alert, to the point of barely maintaining it, so how was it possible for them to extravagantly rear a Beyonder creature?\nFurthermore, more importantly, there was the fact that wild Beyonder creatures were usually hostile to humans. Any encounter would usually lead to one dead, so if one wanted to capture them alive, they would need to have a sufficiently strong team or be strong enough to overwhelm the enemy. Of course, this didn't exclude particular Beyonders who possessed special abilities that were suitable for such situations.\nAfter a bout of disappointment, the Apothecary coughed lightly and said, \"I've brought quite a few bottles of medicine. All of you know the effects. If you want them, you can speak up when the gathering is almost over.\"\nThe few medicines to treat wounds, go berserk, and increase one's ability in that aspect?Klein silently lampooned. He chuckled and provided a suggestion.\n\"You can purchase a Sequence 9 formula, find the corresponding Beyonder ingredients, and then concoct the potion to feed the animal you fancy. This way, you will have a Sequence 9 Beyonder creature, and you can also continuously advance it with the subsequent potions.\n\"Of course, that's built on the premise that you are rich enough and can deal with the defective ones that lose control.\"\nThe Apothecary was stunned for a few seconds. After a while, he said, \"How extravagant.\"\n\"Just saving up money and finding the Beyonder ingredients for myself is difficult enough for me. It's also a high probability event for an animal to lose control after they consume potions. It will take me several times before I succeed.\n\"Someone who can do this must have a mine or owns a bank.\"\nOur Tarot Club's Miss Justice likely rears a Beyonder creature...Klein suddenly felt sorry for the Apothecary.\nIf one wanted to disregard it for the sole purpose of earning money, Apothecaries were the easiest among the Low-Sequence Beyonders to amass large amounts of wealth. The problem was that they were also easily targeted by the official Beyonders.\nAfter a few more deals or failed transactions, Klein heard a voice that was deliberately suppressed, \"I only brought one Beyonder weapon this time.\"\n\"They are fifty bullets with different effects. Twenty of them are engraved with the sun domain's labels and symbols, forming a complete charm. They can be used to purify ghost-related monsters. They cause more damage to wraiths and shadows, so they are called purifying bullets. There are another twenty bullets which are meant for corrupted creatures, known as demon hunting bullets. The other ten are bullets that counter evil-type monsters, known as exorcism bullets. Their effects can be maintained for eighteen months or more.\n\"Fifty bullets for 500 pounds or the Barbarian potion formula. It will come with a revolver with the matching caliber.\"\nThey did make related bullets according to my suggestions from last time. From the looks of it, they're more complicated than ordinary Beyonder weapons. It took them so long only to make a set...Klein didn't give the others a chance and directly said, \"I have the Barbarian potion formula.\"\nAt this moment, a rather tall man offered a price.\n\"550 pounds.\"\nIn this day and age, a revolver was the most convenient Beyonder weapon to use and carry!\nThe well-hidden lady's voice was filled with unquenchable joy as she said, \"Sir, I'm sorry. I have a preference for the Barbarian formula.\"\n\"600 pounds.\" The man raised the offer again.\n\"No, this is not about money.\" The woman with an Artisan backing her glanced at Klein. \"Deal! But please pass the formula to Old Mister Eye of Wisdom for his notarization.\"\nPhew, it's a good thing that I got the Dark Emperor card. Otherwise, if I met someone who can raise the price so ruthlessly, I definitely would've lost a lot of money today...Klein rolled up his robe, took out the Barbarian formula which he had long written from his inner pocket, and opened it to take a look.\n\"Sequence 8 Barbarian. Main ingredients: Grass of Madness, core horn crystal of a Land Rhinoceros. Supplementary ingredients: One deep-grained Walnut, one Fragrance Hornet Grass, 10 ml of the extract obtained from soaking poplar bark, 100 ml of liquor.\"\nAfter confirming that it was correct, Klein folded the paper and handed it to the attendant.\nJust like before, Eye of Wisdom took out the ring that was inlaid with many small diamonds. He mimicked the Beyonder powers of a Notary and confirmed that the formula was true.\nHearing this old man declare that \"the formula is valid,\" the woman with the Artisan backing her heaved a sigh of relief and took out a square iron box the size of a palm.\nAfter the attendant passed the formula to her, she eagerly rolled it open and read it a few times, as if she wanted to memorize it directly. As for Klein, he snapped open the box and looked at it.\nThere were three piles of bullets inside the metal box. One pile had a faint golden luster, as though they had just been fished out of hot water; the other was entirely silver and covered with patterns, cold yet sacred. The pile with the fewest bullets suffused a golden sheen amidst the brass color. He could vaguely see several labels and symbols engraved on it.\nYes, it's authentic...Klein had the ability to appraise the bullets in the field of mysticism. He snapped the lid shut and stored the item in the pocket under his robe.\nAs for the free revolver, it was nothing special. The body of the gun was a deeper brass color, and the handle was made out of walnut wood.\nSince his underarm holster had also been lost back when he encountered the police inspection, Klein had to attach the revolver to his waist and cover it with his clothes.\nAfter finishing the transaction, he looked around the activity room and deliberately raised his voice.\n\"I need strong purifying items like Sun Holy Water and Sun Sacred Emblem.\n\"I can buy it in gold, or I can use formulas as a barter, like the Sequence after Barbarian-Briber.\n\"Of course, if there are any questions regarding the mysticism and the Beyonder world that requires answering, I can also give it a try, but I can't guarantee that I can answer it.\"\nAs the Apothecary listened, he widened his eyes. He had a feeling that this was that \"lucky lad.\"\nHowever, he had just become a Beyonder not long ago, so how could he have obtained so many valuable things?The more he thought about it, the more he gnashed his teeth, feeling as if he had made the wrong choice back then.\nLuck was the most important thing!\nThe woman who had bought the Barbarian formula couldn't control herself and almost said in her original voice, \"I don't have anything you need, but I can pay you in cash. Eight hundred pounds!\"\nKlein swallowed the word \"deal\" that he nearly said. He thought for a moment before chuckling.\n\"I'm only accepting bartering for the time being.\n\"I will most likely be back for the next gathering. You can seek out the relevant items in advance.\"\nFor the time being...The lady ruminated over the word and nodded slowly.\n\"Alright.\"\nAfter that, no one else said anything, and Klein's needs were also not met. In Backlund, in the Loen Kingdom, the worshipers of the Eternal Blazing Sun could be considered heretics, so few of such items circulated beyond official channels.\nKlein was slightly disappointed, but he wasn't too concerned. He had an alternative plan.\nHe clearly remembered that Miss Xio had once sought out a Beyonder believer of the Eternal Blazing Sun for purification!\nAnd the lady who craved the Briber formula would definitely be actively looking for his desired items.\nKlein stopped talking and listened to the subsequent exchanges.\nWhen the gathering was coming to an end, an average built participant with no special characteristics pinched the iron mask on his face and said with a deep baritone voice, \"I need an adult Black Widow Spider Silk Gland.\"\nAn adult Black Widow Spider Silk Gland? Sounds familiar. I seem to have heard of it somewhere...Klein frowned slightly. Without using divination, he tried hard to recall where.\nSuddenly, he remembered the source of the familiar feeling.\nIt was one of the main ingredients for the Demoness of Pleasure!"}
{"num_chp":302,"summary":"The detective, who had been on leave, returned to Grimm Garden Street shortly after Klein and the others had finished their lunch. This also meant that his assignment was over.\nDue to the visible improvement in Adol's situation, Rogo Colloman was quite generous in the settlement of his pay, and he paid an additional fifty percent above the ten pounds which they had agreed upon.\nAs expected of a jewelry businessman to be this generous. However, compared to the other people in West Borough and Empress Borough, he isn't considered that rich. Grimm Garden Street is close to the suburbs, and it's not too far from the cemetery. I can reach it in ten minutes if I run at full speed... Eh, Miss Bodyguard, no-Miss Sharron, is highly likely of being a Sequence 5 Beyonder. She charges one thousand pounds for three days, while I, as a Sequence 7 Beyonder, am only worth fifteen pounds a day. There's still a big difference...\nOf course, if I were to take on such missions every day, my income would be over 5,400 pounds a year, putting me at the top of the middle class. Even the top manager of the Backlund Bank makes 5,000 pounds a year... Heh heh, this is just pure fantasy. For most detectives, business comes sporadically... And the amount of Beyonder ingredients I need to advance to Sequence 6 is definitely more than 3,000 pounds. Just thinking about it makes my head hurt. For normal people, this is a huge sum of money, enough to sustain a good life!\nThe good news is that even if I grasp the \"acting method,\" digesting the Sequence 7 potion will take me somewhere between six months to three years. Even if I can quickly conclude the rules of a Magician, I'll only be able to push forward that lowest threshold by one to two months. I still have plenty of time to save up and search for clues to these ingredients...\nWait. Miss Justice still owes me, uh-my adorer 5,000 pounds...\nHowever, her financial situation isn't in good shape recently. It will be difficult for her to come up with a large sum of cash in the next few months...\nKlein took the three five-pound notes and left West Borough with thoughts running through his mind.\nAfter returning to Minsk Street, he quickly burned the used paper figurine and made another two more.\nIn the evening, he took the steam metro to the Backlund Bridge district, and according to the numbers provided in the newspapers, he knocked on the door of the house where the gathering would take place.\nSimilar to the past few times, he put on an iron mask that covered only the upper half of his face, wore a hooded black robe, and followed the attendant into the activity room, where only one candle burned quietly.\nAt first glance, Klein noticed that the number of Beyonders present at this gathering was less than half of what it used to be.\nI came at the exact time. Are the others late?This time, Klein didn't change his gait and picked a corner before sitting down slowly.\nAfter a few minutes, the old Eye of Wisdom cleared his throat and said, \"Let's begin the gathering. The others shouldn't be coming.\"\nAfter saying that, he gave a brief explanation.\n\"As the serial killer has yet to be found, the Nighthawks, Mandated Punishers, and the Machinery Hivemind, as well as a large number of MI9 Beyonders, are out doing large-scale investigations and searches.\n\"Under such a situation, it's very normal and understandable for those friends to be unwilling to go out and participate in gatherings.\n\"Frankly, I'm surprised by the number of people that showed up today.\"\nSure enough, a circle of Beyonders isn't isolated; they would also be affected by current affairs...Klein looked around and saw that the fat Apothecary wasn't absent. His heart immediately relaxed.\nThe Apothecary nudged the metal mask on his face, calling out without much hope, \"Seeking to purchase the Spring of Elves marrow crystals. Price is negotiable.\"\n\"I have it,\" Klein said without hesitation.\nHe was worried that someone else might've found this Beyonder ingredient, thereby causing the price of his stock of goods to fall.\nAlthough Beyonder ingredients were rare, and it was rare for items to reappear in independent circles, one could never be too careful.\n\"Seeking to purchase the Spring of Elves marrow crystals...\" The Apothecary didn't seem to hear the response.\nHe was halfway through the sentence when it suddenly struck him. He turned his head to look at Klein and blurted, \"You do?\"\n\"Yes.\" Klein found his fiery gaze a little too overwhelming.\nAs he did so, he rolled up his black robe and took out an iron cigarette case.\nPa!Klein opened the cigarette case, revealing the faded, egg-shaped Spring of Elves marrow crystal.\n\"If you're worried, you can let the Old Mister Eye of Wisdom appraise it,\" Klein added in a low voice.\nThis wasn't really necessary because it was obvious if something was a Beyonder ingredient or not. It was also quickly identified if something was contaminated or not.\nHowever, if one was lacking in mysticism knowledge, a Beyonder ingredient could very easily be mixed up with similar-looking ingredients. When that happened, one needed an appraisal.\nThe Apothecary looked like he was looking at a beautiful lady he had been yearning for all this time. He looked at the Beyonder ingredient in Klein's hands, mesmerized. After a few seconds, he shook his head and said, \"No, there's no need! That's it! That's it!\"\nKlein curved the corner of his lips into a smile and named his price.\n\"300 pounds and clues to the Apothecary formula.\"\n\"Clues to the Apothecary formula... It's you!\" The Apothecary was stunned for a moment before he finally understood who the man was.\nIt was the guy who made him bring the sedative for nothing!\nSoon after, his heart pained, his regret similarly reaching its limit as he sighed emotionally. \"You really are a lucky guy!\n\"Why didn't I choose that road of fortune...\"\nI'm the King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck after all...Klein lampooned himself.\nThe Apothecary sighed and changed his posture.\n\"That's too expensive. 200 pounds and a clue to the formula.\"\n\"The clue to the formula is only a bonus because I cannot confirm its veracity. Therefore, 300 pounds, not a penny less, I believe it's needed elsewhere.\" Klein smiled. \"This price is actually very fair. If it were anyone else, they might've offered 400 or even 500 pounds, and you might've even accepted that price.\"\n\"I'm not that foolish. I can still wait...\" The apothecary grumbled before saying, \"The clue can be verified by Old Man, uh-Old Mister Eye of Wisdom.\"\n\"It must be something that exists objectively, something that has detailed information before I'm able to appraise it. Just a clue isn't among these conditions,\" Eye of Wisdom said.\nDivination, on the other hand, can roughly determine whether the clue is effective as long as it doesn't involve powers two or three Sequences above myself...Klein silently said to himself.\nHowever, he wouldn't reveal his expertise in divination at a Beyonder gathering.\n\"Alright then... 300 pounds plus the clue. You lucked out!\" The Apothecary took a deep breath and pulled out a thick wad of cash. He then counted the corresponding amount and then asked the attendant to bring him a pen and paper before he started writing.\nAfter he was done writing the clue, he crumpled the paper into a ball and handed it along with the cash and some items to the attendant.\nKlein was suddenly stunned when he saw the attendant walk over.\nIn addition to the cash and clue, there were also four glass tubes filled with what seemed to be pure liquids.\n\"What are these?\" Klein asked, perplexed.\n\"Have you forgotten? Your sedative, the sedative I specially concocted. It's ten soli a bottle, two pounds for four, so the cash there is 298 pounds,\" answered the Apothecary. \"If you're worried about my sedative, you can have it appraised.\"\nI really forgot... I did all of that to gain Miss Sharron's trust, and now that she's not here, well... It's fine; maybe a sedative would be able to handle some unexpected situations...Klein stopped talking, took out the Spring of Elves marrow crystal, took the items, counted the cash in front of everyone, and determined their authenticity with the faint candlelight.\nA total of 298 pounds... That's right...Seeing that his wallet could no longer hold any more cash, Klein could only roll up the bills and slip them into his pocket.\nAfter putting away the sedative, he unfolded the note and glanced at the clue.\n\"On the south side of the Bridge, on Rose Street, at the Harvest Church, find Bishop Utravsky. As long as you help him complete a mission, you'll be able to get the Apothecary formula.\"\nHarvest Church. That's one of the few cathedrals of the Church of Mother Earth in the kingdom. This Church also grasps two Beyonder pathways: \"Planter\" and \"Apothecary\"... The clues match well...Klein thought as he refolded the note.\nAs the gathering continued, it was unknown whether the female Beyonder with the Artisan backing her wasn't present, or she just didn't have any new Beyonder weapons to sell. There were no signs of her, leaving Klein disappointed. Now that he had 509 pounds in hand, he wanted to equip himself nicely.\nAfter many transactions were aborted, a man sitting on a stool said in a low voice, \"A friend of mine was unfortunately discovered in this investigation. He's imprisoned in a particular Lord of Storms cathedral by the Mandated Punishers. I wish to hire a few helpers to rescue him.\"\nEye of Wisdom immediately replied, \"Stray Dog, give up that thought! A cathedral's Mandated Punishers and Sealed Artifacts are enough to destroy all of us here.\n\"Your friend's fate has already been decided. Don't let yourself be trapped in the same situation.\"\nStray Dog looked around and realized that no one responded to his request. He couldn't help but thump his thigh, growling, \"But, what did he do wrong?\n\"He's an excellent physician. He's saved a lot of patients and has never hurt anyone! Just because he consumed a potion and became a Beyonder, he's to be imprisoned in a place where the sun never shines. He'll even become an experimental subject for the Mandated Punishers?\n\"Why?\n\"Why...\"\nStray Dog's agonized questions echoed in the room. Even the Apothecary, who couldn't keep his mouth shut, remained silent.\nSigh...Klein, a former official Beyonder, could only sigh deeply in his heart.\nWithout the spread of the \"acting method,\" wild Beyonders are ticking time bombs...\nBut if the \"acting method\" is popularized, then the situation would become even more chaotic and bloody... After all, there are the Laws of Beyonder Characteristics Indestructibility and Conservation...\nIn this heavy atmosphere, the gathering came to an end. Klein, who had gotten nothing else, spoke again.\n\"Who has revolvers and bullets that come augmented with different Beyonder effects?\n\"For example, purification, demon-hunting, etc.\"\nHe didn't specifically fix the caliber of the bullets because he didn't have a gun yet. He could simply wait until he bought the bullets before matching the corresponding gun.\nIn the midst of the silence, a female Beyonder sitting in the same corner replied in a low voice, \"I can help you ask, and I'll give you the answer at the next gathering.\"\nIt seemed to be the lady with the Artisan backing her...Klein sighed.\n\"Alright.\"\nAfter the gathering ended, he didn't return to Minsk Street directly. Instead, he went to East Borough and changed his clothes, heading to the border between North Borough and Hillston Borough.\nIt was where the suspected member of the Numinous Episcopate, Kapusky Reid, lived."}
{"num_chp":1181,"summary":"Upon hearing the bishop's instructions, Leonard was first taken aback before he inwardly sighed.\nMr. Fool's prophecy was really accurate...\nNo, it's not a prophecy. \"He\" was already aware of everything.\nLeonard quickly reined in his thoughts and followed the procedures to get Bishop Saint Anthony to give him an official document. Then, he returned underground and brought two members into Chanis Gate.\nAfter waiting for the Keepers to check the documents, he came to Emlyn White's room which was illuminated with shining silver candles that were covered with engraved patterns. He opened the heavy stone door with a brass key.\nGhostly blue light entered the cell, \"stabbing\" Emlyn White's eyes to the point of him instinctively closing his eyes.\nHis face was much paler than before, and his body was much thinner. He exuded a feeling that a gust of wind would lift him up at any moment.\nThinking of Mr. Fool's answer, Emlyn suddenly felt confident in his current situation. Without opening his eyes, he slowly stood up and chuckled.\n\"I knew you would take the initiative to send me out.\"\nWould you be disappointed if I said that it was just a routine investigation? Leonard lampooned inwardly and replied without any expression, \"I'll give you thirty seconds. If you don't leave Chanis Gate within this period, I'll take it as you voluntarily choosing to stay behind.\"\nAs a slightly more senior Nighthawk and a captain of a Red Gloves team for several months, Leonard had rich experience in dealing with prisoners.\nEmlyn's expression froze. He opened his mouth, wanting to say something, but he ultimately maintained his silence. He walked past Leonard and his two teammates and walked out of Chanis Gate.\nOutside, he suddenly shuddered, as if he wanted to purge the chill in his body.\n\"Once you return, getting some sunlight would fix you up. Oh, the sun is a rare commodity in Backlund's winter, and you vampires don't enjoy sunbathing... Aren't you an Apothecary? You can concoct some medicine from the Sun domain yourself.\" Seeing this, Leonard casually reminded him.\nEmlyn's condition wasn't the best. On the one hand, he hadn't drunk any spirituality-containing human blood for days. He could only rely on the blood of animals as a substitute. On the other hand, it was because he had stayed behind Chanis Gate for too long. The power of Evernight that supported the seal had eaten into him a little, making him require the effects of medicine from the Sun domain to remove the residual effects.\nAs a Potions Professor, Emlyn was aware of his physical and mental condition. He didn't retort or nod. He only emphasized the word \"Sanguine\" before asking, \"Where's Father Utravsky?\"Visit website our Listnovel.com\n\"He still needs to stay a little while longer. I hope this bloody war will end soon. Don't worry, we'll let him come out twice a week to get some sunlight. As for which days they'll be, it'll depend on the weather in Backlund.\" Leonard gave a simple response before sending Emlyn White to the ground and onto the streets.\nEmlyn hesitated for a moment before asking again, \"Where's the nearest hospital?\"\n\"What do you want to do?\" Leonard asked in a professional manner.\n\"Get a blood transfusion.\" Emlyn raised his chin slightly, trying his best not to change his expression.\nBlood transfusion... more like drinking blood... Leonard didn't call him out. He pointed in one direction and gave him the address.\nAfter watching the Sanguine Viscount leave, he returned underground and began to discuss a recent case with his team members.\n...\nAfter several days of traveling, Klein finally arrived near the Nois City ruins in the north.\nThis was equally a desolate plain. The dried riverbed left traces of itself on the ground.\nLooking at the dark, shadowy city that was filled with a thin fog, he was in no hurry to get close. Instead, he found a hidden spot and muttered the honorific name of Mr. Fool.\nFollowing that, he took four steps counterclockwise and recited the incantation before entering the world above the gray fog. To return to Sefirah Castle with just a thought, he needed the prayers of the Tarot Club members to stack together, forming a strong and firm anchor. That way, it would provide The Fool with the sufficient summoning power.\nWith the help of the prayer light, Klein used his \"true vision\" to check the situation of the Nois ruins from afar. He discovered that the thin fog was slowly dissipating, but it couldn't completely dissipate. On the surface of the city, there wasn't a single Spirit Body Thread. The people who were dressed in linen robes or animal hides were lying in different spots on the streets. They weren't as lively and busy as the time the City of Silver's expedition team visited.\nAfter the angel or Sealed Artifact that occupied this city discovered that \"Their\" whereabouts were exposed, they chose to migrate? As Klein made a guess based on the situation in front of him, he retracted his gaze and looked at the grayish-white fog that held up Sefirah Castle.\nHe was trying to prevent the Miracle Invoker, or Attendant of Mysteries, or the corresponding Sealed Artifact from hiding in the Historical Void and ambushing the Beyonders of the ancient Nois City. He didn't wish to directly encounter a cluster of translucent maggots that twisted into a huge vortex when he leaped into the fog of history, nor did he wish to be pursued by those terrifying tentacles.\nThe ambush that Zaratul had laid for him still left Klein feeling a lingering sense of fear. From time to time, he would have nightmares, hoping to seek Miss Justice for another round of treatment for psychological trauma.\nThis stimulus was worse than seeing his marionette, Enuni, wear a monocle in front of him while his body remained completely immobile. This was because he had implicated the Hounds of Fulgrim.\nAfter confirming that the Historical Void was safe, Klein returned to the real world. He stretched out his hand, grabbed, and pulled out his former self. This former self was also wearing a silk half top hat, a black trench coat, and holding a simple glass lantern.\nIn the next second, he \"jumped\" into the grayish-white fog and followed the illuminated spots in the Historical Void, running all the way to a period before the First Epoch, in that city of a long-dead civilization.\nTo him, this was a very ingenious \"safe house.\" This was because, aside from him, no Scholar of Yore could trace back to this lost piece of history.\nOf course, to him, coming all the way here had required him to expend a lot of his spirituality. He could only stay there for another fifteen minutes at most, and that was only if he didn't make any burdening attempts at summoning Historical Void projections.\nAfter hiding his true body, Klein's projection in the real world moved forward, quickly arriving outside the Nois ruins.\nHe didn't blindly approach or enter. After circling to a small mound opposite the dried riverbed, he raised his right hand and summoned his original marionette-the cold Earl of The Fallen Qonas Kilgor with dark blue eyes.\nQonas's body squirmed and instantly transformed into Gehrman Sparrow. Then, he reached out and took out a lantern from the Historical Void.\nThe historical projection who summoned a historical projection had \"Disordered\" the distance under the dim yellow light of the lantern. In a few steps, he arrived outside Nois City, alone.\nWith the lantern in hand, he passed through the rotting buildings and passed through the thin fog before entering the ruins.\nCompared to using his \"true vision\" above the gray fog, actual contact made him discover more details.\nThe humans and monsters lying in different spots had signs of decay, as though they had been abandoned for some time.\nSome of them sat on chairs under the eaves of the house, others slumped beside stoves. Some held moldy bread while others held hands. There were some leaning against the walls and sitting on the ground, their lips pressed against a bone flute...\nThis allowed Klein to imagine the situation in the city back when they were \"living.\"\nSome of them were slacking off and resting. Some were baking food, and others were shopping along the streets. Others were focused on music as some came and went, laughing nonstop. There were also others fighting monsters in an arena...\nThis was such a lively and bustling scene, but in reality, everyone had already died and were no longer in possession of their souls. They were only repeating predetermined actions.\nAnd one day, this strange scene froze with time, and everyone collapsed without any warning.\nA city formed by marionettes, the most realistic theater... Back then, the foggy town was in a similar situation... Although I'm also a Seer, I still have to say that, in terms of horror, terror, and bizarreness, our pathway is definitely ranked amongst the top three... Could it be that I'll be acting in the same manner in the future? Attendant of Mysteries? With the lantern in hand, Klein walked through the streets that were littered with corpses. He followed his spiritual intuition and headed for the ancient Nois City's center.\nThe situation here made him believe that the person who had once ruled the Nois ruins definitely had enough intelligence. After the City of Silver's expedition team broke the peace and serenity here, the entity didn't choose to kill or destroy any clues. Instead, this place was abandoned without hesitation before the entity migrated elsewhere.\nThe reason why the City of Silver wasn't silenced probably had to do with an Amon parasite following behind. Yes, it could also be because of the True Creator... As he casually let his thoughts wander, Klein quickly arrived at a relatively intact cathedral.\nInside the cathedral stood a statue of a demonic wolf with eight legs. It was covered with short and dark hair.\nThere was a tuft of grayish-white fur at the top of the statue head. Its pitch-black pupils covered at least three-quarters of its eyes.\nIt's not Flegrea... The Dark Demonic Wolf that occasionally appeared in the Third Epoch, the God of Wishes? \"He\" has been in the Forsaken Land of the Gods for thousands of years and has finally found that Sequence 1 Beyonder characteristic? Just as this thought flashed through his mind, Klein suddenly heard footsteps coming, resounding one after another.\nStanding sideways, he immediately cast his gaze outside the cathedral. He saw a figure slowly walking through the thin fog before its outline quickly formed.\nHe was nearly 2.3 meters tall, with a slight hunch to his back. With grizzled hair, wrinkles at the corners of his eyes, and a scar at the corners of his mouth, he looked like an old priest or bishop while donning a long black clergyman's robe.\nHis dark brown eyes were calm, unlike the monsters deep in the darkness who were bloodthirsty and zero intelligence.\nHowever, in the long, quiet night of low-frequency lightning, this clergyman didn't carry any animal hide lanterns or have any fire lit. He just quietly walked through the thin fog."}
{"num_chp":101,"summary":"Howes Street, Divination Club.\nKlein pressed down on his half top hat and walked along the stairway towards the main door.\nHe wasn't dressed in his usual formal wear. Today, he was wearing a white shirt and a light-colored vest, paired with a thin black windbreaker, making him look more spirited than he had before.\nThis set of clothing was more suitable for combat and had only cost him one pound, including the fee for the small pocket that he had sewn into the vest. Compared to the suit he had purchased, it was so cheap that it brought tears to his eyes.\nHe stroked the revolver in his holster, as well as the metal bottles in his tiny inner pocket. Klein then took out the portrait and entered the Divination Club.\nWithout any surprise, he met the beautiful attendant, Angelica.\n\"Good afternoon, Mr. Moretti. I thought you would come only a few days later.\" Angelica was taken aback at first before she immediately revealed a brilliant smile.\nKlein took off his hat and sighed.\n\"Good afternoon, Miss Angelica. I had a dream at noon. I dreamed about Mr. Hanass Vincent and matters regarding him. You know that, as a fortune-teller, I absolutely cannot overlook any dream. It could be a revelation from the divine.\"\nConfused by his charlatan-like words, Angelica nodded in thought and asked out of curiosity, \"What did you dream of?\"\n\"I saw Hanass Vincent arguing with someone.\" Klein passed her the folded piece of paper in his hand.\nAs Angelica unfolded the portrait, he pinched his glabella and observed the color of her emotions.\n\"This person...\" Angelica looked at the realistic portrait and slipped into deep thought.\nKlein saw her emotions turn into a \u2018thinking blue', a normal reaction.\n\"This person...\" Angelica muttered once again. She slowly looked up and said, \"I've met him before.\"\nKlein's mind whirled as he immediately asked, \"When was it?\"\n\"I can't remember the exact date. Maybe a month ago? I saw him send Mr. Vincent to the door and they were softly discussing something. I have a deep impression of him because of his thick and messy eyebrows, as well as Mr. Vincent's rare smile,\" Angelica described as she recalled. \"Yes, he had a pair of grayish-blue eyes and, like most men his age, had little hair on his head.\"\n\"Did you meet him again before or after that?\" asked Klein gently.\nAngelica shook her head.\n\"No, I am certain of that. I don't even know his name. To be honest, if it wasn't you, I would have suspected that any person showing me a portrait like this is a policeman investigating Mr. Vincent's death. Heh, I don't find it odd no matter what revelation you receive, for you are a true Seer.\"\nMy apologies, I am a policeman...Klein retorted silently as he sighed and said, \"A true Seer would understand how minuscule he truly is compared to the vastness of fate. We can only see a hazy corner, forever receiving revelations, but never answers. We must reflect upon them constantly and keep up our respect and fear. We must decipher these hints with caution and not see ourselves as the intelligent ones who have taken control of fate.\"\nBy summarizing what he had figured out over the past few weeks, Klein suddenly realized that his Spirit Vision turned clearer. He could even faintly make out the details within Angelica's aura.\nAt that instant, he felt like a shortsighted man who was wearing glasses that suited him.\nThis... has my Seer potion begun to produce clear signs of digestion?Klein was stunned in disbelief.\n\"I never imagined that a Seer like you can still maintain such fear and respect towards fate. It's truly admirable,\" said Angelica earnestly.\nShe had seen too many people in the Divination Club who claimed to see through the truth and change fate after learning a few divination methods.\nKlein retracted his gaze and chuckled.\n\"The more you know, the better you can understand how small we truly are.\"\nAs he was saying this, he checked his body's condition and reflected on his past experiences. He could basically narrow the essence of the \u2018acting' technique to \u2018actions corresponding to the name of the potion, understanding the hidden laws governing the role, as well as strictly abiding by these laws'.\nOnly by doing so could he change the state of his body, heart, and soul, making them closer to the remnant psyche in the potion, so as to gradually digest it.\nThe acknowledgment of a Seer's identity was only a factor on the surface. The reason why it made one's spirituality feel light had to do with how the feedback strengthened one's affirmation of particular divination actions. And these actions collectively formed the rules for digesting the Seer potion.\nTo help others interpret revelations and guide them in a better direction; yet constantly maintain one's fear and respect towards fate. One cannot be too egoistical, too proud, or blindly believe one's interpretations... These are the laws I can think of for the time being, as well as the essence of the \u2018acting' technique that will guide me towards the future. If it continues to be this successful, I won't need half a year. Perhaps in two or three months, or even two to three weeks time, I'll be ready to completely digest the potion.\n... That sign was extremely obvious. It's no wonder the mysterious Mr. Zaratul said that the Beyonder will clearly sense it when the potion is fully digested. There's no need for anyone to teach them. It is what it is... Just like now, although my Spirit Vision has been enhanced a little, I know very well that this is only a pit stop in the digestion process and not the final destination.\nWith this in mind, Klein couldn't help but thank the suited clown for teaching him with his life!\nIf it wasn't for him, he would probably spend months at the Divination Club, summarizing the rules of a Seer through numerous attempts-for better or for worse-before he began \u2018acting' strictly.\n\"Mr. Moretti, I sometimes even think of you as a philosopher,\" Angelica said with a sigh upon hearing Klein's reply.\n\"In my circle of friends, the term \u2018philosopher' is used to scold somebody.\" Klein was in a good mood.\nWith that said, he bowed, wore his hat, and left after bidding farewell.\nAlthough Angelica was unaware of the gentleman's name or identity, Klein was in no way depressed. What he learned was sufficient enough for him to engage in the next phase of his plan.\n...\n36 Zouteland Street. Inside Blackthorn Security Company.\nDunn looked at the portrait in his hands with his deep gray eyes.\n\"You wish to carry out a search for this person?\"\n\"Yes.\" Klein had long prepared a reason for this. \"Captain, didn't I mention that I would head to the Divination Club to observe the reactions of its members on Hanass Vincent's sudden death? I didn't discover anything yesterday, but I accidentally found out today that the person in the portrait had appeared with Hanass Vincent once and was secretly discussing something with him. I flipped through our team's investigation report just now, but I didn't discover any person resembling him in the report.\"\nThere were no loopholes in his description. Even if Dunn Smith were to take this portrait to the Divination Club, he would get the same answer from Angelica.\nDunn cast his gaze away from the portrait and laughed.\n\"From the looks of it, the compensation funds weren't a waste.\"\n... Captain, isn't your memory bad? Why would you mention the compensation at this point in time...Klein maintained a smile and didn't say a word.\n\"Was this drawn by you?\" Dunn asked in passing.\n\"Yes. I drew it with the help of ritualistic magic,\" Klein replied, completely honest.\nOf course, speaking the truth and revealing the whole truth were two different matters.\nDunn nodded slightly and said, \"Get Old Neil to make a few more sets. I'll get Kenley and Royale to investigate and seek the cooperation of the police department. If this clue is of any use, you would've contributed greatly once again.\"\n\"May Goddess bless us.\" Klein tapped four spots on his chest as he appeared abnormally devout.\nFor him, all he needed from Dunn and company was to figure out the name and identity of the man in the portrait. He could divine his location above the gray fog!\n...\nDespite it being his day off, Klein didn't immediately return home after leaving the Blackthorn Security Company. Instead, he took the public carriage to the harbor and arrived in front of the Evil Dragon Bar's entrance.\nIn his considerations, although a Seer lacked the means to directly engage in combat with an enemy or the means to cast spells quickly, combat could be classified in many ways. Not all battles were chance encounters. As long as he had sufficient time to prepare, a Seer could similarly deal with an enemy using ritualistic magic. It was exactly how he resolved the magic mirror divination incident at Selena's house.\nAnd this also meant that it was best if a Seer brought along the essential oils, herbs, and tiny candles to avoid being in a situation where they were unavailable when they were needed most, thus, resulting in a helpless death. After all, not everyone was like Selena who had an entire assortment of mysticism items which could be used.\nAs for the ones he applied for, as Klein had practiced frequently, he had used up most of them. He kept what was left in his tiny inner pocket.\nHe patted the cash note in his pocket and pushed open Evil Dragon Bar's door and strode in.\nIt was noon and there weren't many customers in the bar. Nor were there any rat-baiting or boxing matches. It was quiet and not lively enough.\nKlein observed the guests drinking beer and playing cards as he walked toward the billiard room that led to the underground market.\nAt that moment, he saw a muscular old man walk out with a torn Admiral's jacket draped over his shoulders.\n\"Were you the friend Old Neil brought last time?\" Reeking with the smell of alcohol, the blue-eyed, messy brown-haired elder sized up Klein and laughed.\nKlein guessed at his identity and took off his hat and bowed.\n\"Yes, how might I address you?\"\n\"Old Neil often mentions you. I'm the boss here, Swain.\" The blue-eyed elder's arms were thick and brawny. He had firm muscles and had the bearing of a military officer.\nFormer Tingen Mandated Punisher Captain... Rumor has it that he was once part of the Royal Navy...Klein replied politely, \"Yes.\"\n\"If you're in need of money, feel free to approach me.\" Swain laughed as he mentioned before walking towards the bar counter.\nAt that moment, Klein's heart stirred as he immediately shouted, \"Wait a moment, Mr. Swain. I have something I would like to ask of you.\"\nSwain halted in his steps, turned halfway around, and said with a chuckle, \"You look, well-very similar.\"\nNo, I'm not having memory issues...The corner of Klein's lips twitched as he pointed at the portrait he drew and asked, \"Have you met this gentleman before?\"\nHe suddenly realized that Selena had likely been brought by Hanass Vincent to the underground market. This resulted in Elizabeth's knowledge of the Evil Dragon Bar as well. Then, could the man in the portrait who had some relationship with Hanass Vincent have come here before?\nSwain took a careful look and replied affirmatively, \"I remember him. He had asked me if I had documents or items related to the main peak of the Hornacis mountain range.\"\nDocuments and items related to the main peak of the Hornacis mountain range?Klein was taken aback as he suddenly connected that to another matter.\nBack when he was borrowing the journal issue related to the main peak of the Hornacis mountain range at Deweyville Library, the librarian had casually mentioned that someone had just returned it. Therefore, he still remembered very cleverly and didn't need to flip through his name cards to determine if the man existed.\nCould the gentleman who borrowed the journal issue before me be the one in the portrait?\nThe gentleman that had witnessed the exchange of the Antigonus family's notebook."}
{"num_chp":642,"summary":"A knight who knows Dragonese and even used it in the critical stage of his growth... It's no wonder that the Psychology Alchemists wish to obtain the notebook he left behind...Audrey was enlightened as she stopped her wandering thoughts. She happily and seriously discussed the problem that stemmed from such grammatical habits with Michele Deuth.\nSoon, they concluded the discussion over the notebook as Michele began introducing the other items.\nTime passed as the tour slowly came to an end. Audrey had planned on raising her request of purchasing the notebook to their next meeting in order to make her goal less obvious. However, in a friendly atmosphere and with the naturalness of their conversation, she sharply sensed that it was an opportunity. Hence, with the powers of Lie, she made her cheeks blush red.\n\"Mr. Deuth, that helmet from the Sauron royalty that originates from the White Rose War is a keepsake of my ancestors. Pardon my presumptuous, but can I buy it from you? Also, the notebook of the Twenty Year War. I'm very impressed by the knight that stood firm for Sonia Island and also wish to have it.\n\"I know it's not a polite request, but I wish that you can understand how I feel. Of course, you have the right to decline.\"\nHer eyes moved as she obviously darted them around, partially deliberate and truthful to express her lack of confidence and embarrassment.\nMichele subconsciously moved his gaze away as he said with a hoarse and slow voice, \"I'm a collector. I won't sell my collection.\"\nHis tone and the words he used aren't firm enough... In the intel I previously gathered, he's a gentleman who values his reputation greatly. Using cash to purchase his collection is probably unacceptable... The reason why the Psychology Alchemists didn't get someone else to complete the mission is firstly because I have a way of earning contribution points, and secondly, it probably took the Associate Professor's attitude towards such matters in mind... I have to change my approach.Before the visit, Audrey had already carefully decided of different tests according to the intel she received. After some thought, she changed topics.\n\"Mr. Deuth, I heard that you're requesting Stoen University to build an ancient relic research center?\"\n\"Yes, that has been my goal for the past few years,\" Michele looked at Audrey and answered frankly.\nAudrey smiled faintly and said, \"I'm very interested in the research in this area. I also feel a deep respect for you and hope to see your wish fulfilled.\n\"Well, I'm planning on donating 1,000 pounds, a nearby piece of land spanning 2,000\u00a0ares1, and a manor with rather good returns to the faculty you are from at Stoen University. I hope to have a non-profit basic relic search and preservation foundation set up. I know it's not a lot, but I will drum up support from the ladies and gentlemen I know in order to get them to make a certain amount of contributions.\n\"Mr. Deuth, I think you're the most professional relic collector and researcher I know. I'm wondering if you're willing to be the person-in-charge of this non-profit foundation?\"\n2,000 ares of land near the university. That's worth about 6,000 pounds. Together with the manor and the cash, Miss Audrey would be donating nearly 10,000 pounds... With such a non-profit relic search and preservation foundation, the difficulties I would encounter to get my research grants approved would be drastically lowered...Michele paused for a few seconds before revealing a sincere smile. He bowed solemnly and said, \"My honorable lady, the importance you place on academia has left me touched. Its glow is enough to match your beauty and upbringing. I believe I have no reason to reject your invitation.\n\"I've already recorded the contents of the notebook. I will send it and the helmet to your residence tonight. Treat it as a gift from a sincere friend.\"\nSuccess!Audrey was delighted as she wished to praise herself. However, she appeared reserved and indifferent. She didn't do anything that was improper.\n\"It's my honor,\" she said earnestly.\nAlthough the two items were definitely not worth 10,000 pounds, it wouldn't result in any loss on her part.\nIn her plans, this suggestion contained three important goals which yielded three returns!\nThe first goal was naturally to obtain the item and complete the mission. She would then successfully obtain the Hypnotist potion formula from the Psychology Alchemists.\nThe second goal was to enhance her prestige, standing, and image via donating to academic research and the preservation of ancient relics. This was something most nobles and tycoons needed to do. Even if the donation wasn't today, Audrey would have to donate 3,000 pounds or more to the various charitable organizations. Therefore, she believed that her father, Earl Hall, wouldn't stop her from doing this with a few of her properties.\nThe third goal was that by having a foundation that focused on the search and preservation of ancient relics, it made it easier for her to come into contact with historical records or mysterious items of value. Audrey didn't need to personally do anything. All she needed to do was sit at home to receive items that might be beneficial to her. It was equivalent to using 10,000 pounds to produce even more money to establish her own \"faction.\"\nOf course, if Michele Deuth hadn't accepted this exchange, then she had other plans. The kingdom's Higher Education Commission had someone from the Hall family, as well as noble friends she knew. As long as the Associate Professor had anything he needed, she was certain that she had the means to satisfy him.\nHowever, Audrey didn't like such methods. She had a nagging feeling that it was shady and would harm the public interest.\nAfter discussing the matter, Audrey stayed for a little longer and chatted idly for about fifteen minutes. It made the wrapping up process not as sharp and abrupt.\nFollowing that, she first left Michele's house and rode her carriage back to the Hall family's villa in Stoen City.\nPast eight in the evening, she received the Sauron royalty's helmet and the notebook from the Twenty Year War.\nAudrey wore a pair of white-silk gloves and sat before her desk with piqued interest. She placed the helmet to the side as she began flipping through the content in the notebook.\nShe discovered that the records were sparse. The early records indicated how the knight who was stationed in the ancient elvish island had learned how to brew Sonia blood wine, how he chased after women, how he spent the boring days. In the later records, it entered the period of the Twenty Year War. It mainly included his cursing of the people of Feysac, his grumbling about his companions, and the consideration towards his plans to stand fast. It also included the end of how the Sonia Island was first lost.\nApart from the grammatical habits being similar to Dragonese, there aren't any serious problems. Nor can I find any hidden clues...Audrey frowned as she closed the notebook.\nShe had used methods derived from mysticism to do her checks, but they were to no avail.\nThis made her unwilling to waste time as she planned to turn it in to the Psychology Alchemists.\nAs her thoughts raced, she suddenly had a new idea.\nMr. World and Mr. Hanged Man will often consider problems from different angles to provide suggestions. Should I learn from them?\nWell... Viewing it from a different point of view, if the content of the notebook isn't problematic, would the physical item actually be what the Psychology Alchemists are after?\nWhat's so special about it? I didn't discover anything... It belongs to a knight who's accustomed to using Dragonese. That knight must've experienced something... Divination! Yes, divination! Perhaps I can find the knight's final location using divination with the help of the notebook. And this might be related to a dragon!\nSince it's a dragon, there's a high chance that it's a mind dragon, a representative of the Spectator pathway. Clues involving it would indeed be something the Psychology Alchemists will pay close attention to...\nAudrey, that's some nice thinking!\nAudrey's eyes turned crystal clear as it seemed to hide a clear resplendence.\nShe couldn't help but turn her head and looked at the golden retriever sitting by the side.\nSusie glanced at her owner and barked.\n\"Audrey, do you want me to praise you?\"\n\"No, there's no need...\" Audrey turned her head back, feeling a little embarrassed.\nThen, she discovered an important question. She wasn't able to divine things herself, or it could be said that the revelation that she received from divination would be highly inaccurate!\nThere's no way to confirm it... No, I can seek Mr. Fool's help! A secret deed ritual? It can only be performed on my body and not towards an external object... Artificial sleepwalking? It's similar to secret deed rituals, so it wouldn't do as well... Sacrifice it to Mr. Fool and get \"Him\" to do the divination before bestowing it back to me? No, that won't work. It will appear rather disrespectful. \"He\" isn't my father or teacher, but a real god. Using such a method is way too casual and somewhat sacrilegious...Audrey's thoughts slowly went from Mr. Fool to divination.\nAlthough she was rather incapable of divination, she had a certain level of understanding in the corresponding knowledge. She soon locked onto a particular method of divination.\nIt was to seek the help of a third party's strength-an unknown or mysterious existence-via a certain ritual. The most classic example of such a method was magic mirror divination!\nYes... It's indeed very dangerous, but the danger stems from the possibility that the target is filled with malice or one that can cause a person to break down immediately. But I don't have such worries. I can seek Mr. Fool's help!Audrey blinked and held down her agitation as she said to the golden retriever, \"Susie, guard the door outside. I will use a mysticism method to study this notebook.\"\n\"Didn't you use them before?\" Susie asked, puzzled.\nShe's getting harder to fool...Audrey's eyes darted around as she said confidently, \"I plan on using magic mirror divination.\n\"Don't worry. I'll make the plea to a safe existence.\"\n\"Alright.\" Susie determined that Audrey was speaking the truth.\nShe took a few steps before turning around to exhort her.\n\"Audrey, you need to be careful about being possessed by a mysterious existence.\"\n\"I know,\" Audrey replied without feeling worried at all.\nFrom her point of view, if Mr. Fool really wanted to do something to her, he had countless opportunities in the past. There was no reason for him to wait until this day.\nAfter Susie opened and closed the door by herself and went out, Audrey sat in front of her desk and recited the honorific name of The Fool to request the use of magic mirror divination.\nAfter a while, Klein, who was on the Future, went to the bathroom and headed above the gray fog. There, he heard Miss Justice's prayer.\nThat can be done? That's right. As a mysterious and unknown existence, I can be the third force in a magic mirror divination...Klein allowed it while feeling amused.\nAudrey immediately picked up the notebook, sat in front of the dresser, and lit a candle while facing the mirror."}
{"num_chp":213,"summary":"So Ince Zangwill has gone to Backlund... I wonder how long he'll stay there... Yes... I should confirm this every now and then...Klein leaned forward as he thought. He erased the contents on the goatskin and wrote a new divination statement:\n\"Lanevus's current location.\"\nFrom his point of view, the person that caused the Captain and him to nearly die was undoubtedly Ince Zangwill, but the lunatic Lanevus was definitely an accomplice who cannot shirk from the responsibility. He had to pay the price in blood!\nAfter reciting the statement seven times, Klein once again entered the dream. But the scene that appeared after the foggy world shattered was the same as the one he had seen before!\nA wide, slightly murky river, countless piers and buildings. The buildings were primarily in the present Loen architectural style, some a little more Gothic. There were crowded streets, flourishing sights, chimneys that continually spewed smoke. There were opulent castles standing tall with the trademark Gothic clock towers...\nLanevus was also in the \"Land of Hope,\" the \"City of Cities,\" Backlund!\nKlein opened his eyes, a little confused. He had divined for Lanevus's specific location, but the results were still a very general, vague region.\nThis tells me that Lanevus's Sequence must be much higher than I imagined... No, it could also be that he's received a large benefit from helping the son of the True Creator descend upon this world. For example, a little godhood characteristics, or some object similar to the placenta left behind by Megose's baby? Hmm... The latter would most likely have been taken away by Ince Zangwill.Thoughts ran through Klein's mind as he muttered to himself whilst he made initial assumptions.\nAfter confirming the rough area where both his enemies were, he thought about another problem. He still didn't have the ability to exact revenge!\nEven if Lanevus is only a Sequence 7, or even 8, it wouldn't be easy to deal with him if he did indeed receive a large benefit. Lanevus is also obviously very crafty, he could outwit and defeat Beyonders more powerful than himself... Ince Zangwill is even more terrifying. He's a Sequence 4 Demigod, and he wields a powerful Grade 0 Sealed Artifact... Although there were some secrets surrounding my transmigration, it's clear that I can't convert those secrets into combat strength. It's likely that it's not possible for a very long period of time... The only means that I have are to continue raising my Sequence, or I could collect even more powerful mystical items. I have to use both the methods at the same time...\nIn between his thoughts, Klein decided to add another divination.\nHe deliberated on the statement before writing solemnly, \"My opportunities of becoming powerful.\"\nHe gently placed the pen on the table and leaned back, then he closed his eyes.\nHe recited the statement silently and fell into a deep sleep with the help of Cogitation.\nIn the foggy world, he once again saw the scene that he had previously seen. The river, piers, chimneys, crowds, castles, various machinery, and Gothic clock towers. He had once again seen the capital of the Loen Kingdom, Backlund!\nImmediately following that, the scene changed. He saw a magnificent peak piercing through the clouds, and, on it, he saw a majestic, ancient palace. He saw the giant throne carved from stone, adorned with dull gems and gold. He saw a strange vertical pupil formed from countless mysterious symbols.\nThe scene shattered silently without warning. Klein slowly sat up and tapped on the edge of the table with his fingers.\nBacklund contains the opportunities for me to become powerful...\nDoes the second scene refer to the main peak of the Hornacis mountain range, the treasures left behind by the Antigonus family? The strange vertical pupil formed by countless mysterious symbols which the Misfortune Cloth Puppet conveyed to me through the corruption from the Antigonus family's notebook is the key to beginning all of this...\nMany thoughts flashed through his mind. Klein decided that he was in no rush to visit the Hornacis mountain range. Even a Sequence 4 Demigod might not be able to deal with the dangers that resided there.\nI guess I'll head to Backlund first...Klein sighed and made a decision. He enveloped himself with spirituality and stimulated a descent, exiting the mysterious space above the gray fog.\nWhen he returned to the material world, he slowly walked out of his hiding spot towards Dunn Smith's grave.\nHe stared deeply at the picture and epitaph. Klein slowly drew a crimson moon on his chest and walked out of the cemetery.\nAs a former Nighthawk, a Nighthawk who had to regularly patrol Raphael Cemetery, he was quite familiar with the routes of the guards, as well its surroundings. He managed to leave the cemetery easily, without causing any alarm. He followed the gravel road into Tingen, using the shade of the trees as cover.\nThe night was peaceful and the moon was ever-so dreamy. Klein walked alone, his thoughts running wild and unbridled. He sometimes considered his plan for revenge, sometimes thinking back to the times he spent with the Captain, sometimes recalling Old Neil's hidden grief beneath his humorous facade...\nUnknowingly, Klein had entered the nearest street like a wandering ghost, making his way past turn after turn.\nIt was two hours later when he freed himself from that state and regained complete control of his thoughts.\nHe realized that he was standing on Daffodil Street. Opposite him was the house he shared with his brother and sister.\nInstinctively, Klein had returned here.\nHe took a step forward with clear joy, but suddenly paused. He let out a bitter smile and muttered with a self-deprecating tone, \"If I went up and knocked on the door, Melissa might faint from shock... Benson would be so nervous his hair would start to drop. He would then try his best to calmly convince me, in the name of a curly-haired baboon...\"\nShaking his head, Klein stared at the familiar door for a while before heading towards Iron Cross Street.\nThis is fine too, this is fine too... The things that I do in the future will not implicate them. The compensation given to them by the Nighthawks team and the police department will be enough for them to live a stable middle-class life, even if Melissa fails to find a job and Benson loses his job...\nKlein walked silently for a moment before starting to feel fatigue. But, as someone who was \"dead,\" he didn't have any other belongings on him except for the clothes he was wearing, his topaz pendulum, and Azik's copper whistle. He didn't have pounds, nor soli, nor pennies.\nShould I give the whistle a blow to send a letter to Mr. Azik and get him to help me?Klein laughed optimistically.Forget it, I shouldn't contact him for the time being. Perhaps Ince Zangwill is still keeping him under surveillance. I'll look for him when the time is right... To an old monster who has lived countless lives for thousands of year, he should be able to understand resurrection... At least it's not too cold tonight. I'll make do by finding a place to sleep for the time being and head to the Tingen branch of the Backlund Bank tomorrow morning to retrieve the money in the anonymous account.\nAs there had been too many things to do lately. Klein hadn't had the time to start on the experiments involving the sacrificial ritual. He hadn't touched the 300 pounds in the anonymous account either.\nThat should be enough to support my expenses for quite a while. I'll buy a newspaper tomorrow to confirm what day it is... Miss Justice and the others didn't make any new prayers, which means that I didn't miss a gathering...Klein thought as he found a spot that had no wind. He sat down and took off his jacket. He used it as a blanket and leaned on the wall to sleep.\nIt wasn't long into his sleep when he was suddenly woken by someone. He saw a policeman wielding a baton.\nHe only had a single chevron on his epaulet, the lowest-ranking police constable... Klein glanced at him to ascertain his identity.\nThe policeman said fiercely, \"You can't sleep here!\n\"The streets and parks aren't for you lazy, jobless vagrants to sleep in!\n\"Those are the terms in the Poor Law!\"\nIs that so?Klein froze. Given his sensitive identity, he didn't argue with the policeman.\nHe grabbed his jacket and continued walking until daybreak.\nSoon after, he lowered his head and entered the Tingen branch of the Backlund Bank. He took out 200 pounds with the password he had set, leaving behind a third of the money as \"savings,\" in case of any emergencies.\nWithout a doubt, Klein heard \"prayers\" when he wrote the password in ancient Hermes.\nKlein then spent 38 pounds on two sets of formal wear, two shirts, two trousers, two pairs of leather boots, two bow ties, four pairs of socks, as well as two thick double-breasted jackets, two solid colored fur coats, and two pairs of thick trousers in preparation for the winter. He also bought a cane, a wallet, and a leather luggage bag.\nAfter completing his purchase, Klein found a hotel to wash up and change in. He rented a private carriage directly to the train station in Tingen in order to avoid meeting anyone familiar. Along the way, he purchased a newspaper and discovered that it was Sunday.\nIt took about four hours to get from Tingen to Backlund by train. A luxurious first-class seat cost about three-quarters of a pound, or 15 soli. A second-class seat cost 10 soli, or half a pound.\nThe packed, poorly-maintained third-class seats were rather cheap at only 5 soli.\nKlein thought for a moment before buying a seat for the two o'clock train, a second-class seat.\nKlein found a random spot to sit in the waiting area with his ticket and luggage in hand. It was only slightly after nine in the morning.\nHe was happy that the Loen Kingdom didn't have a strict census. He could prove his identity just by using the water and gas bills, as well as his rent for the past three months. Purchasing a train ticket was even easier, as all he needed was money.\nKlein suddenly had an empty feeling in his heart as he was sitting there, thinking about how he was about to leave for Backlund from Tingen in the afternoon.\nHe thought about his sister who always gave him a motherly vibe. He thought about his brother who liked to crack cold jokes. He thought about how they would fill their stomachs up so much that they wouldn't feel like moving...\nRecalling these scenes, Klein suddenly laughed. He laughed bitterly, for he thought about the tortoise that Melissa called a \"puppet,\" as well as Benson's pitiful hairline.\nHe suddenly had a strong urge. He wanted to see his siblings again.\nAt this moment, Klein suddenly realized why he hadn't picked an earlier train but instead bought a ticket for the two o'clock train.\nHe carried his luggage and left the waiting area quickly, taking a rented carriage back to Daffodil Street.\nHe then hid in a shady area on the opposite side and looked at the door to his house. There were many times when he felt like heading over, but he couldn't bring himself to cross the wide street.\nKlein looked across the road in a daze, suddenly having a feeling of homelessness. He'd had a similar feeling when he had just transmigrated.\nSuddenly, he saw the door to the house open as Melissa and Benson came out.\nMelissa was wearing a black dress and black veiled hat. Benson was in a shirt, vest, trousers, coat, and hat, all in black. They both had numb, sullen expressions.\nMelissa has become skinnier... Why is Benson so haggard...Klein's heart winced in pain. He opened his mouth but couldn't shout out their names.\nWithout realizing it, he followed Benson and Melissa to the nearest municipal square. He saw that tents had been erected there again. A new circus troupe was in town for a performance.\nBenson took out some money and purchased the entrance tickets and led Melissa into the circus. He forced a smile.\n\"This circus troupe is very famous.\"\nMelissa nodded without expression.\n\"Okay.\"\nSuddenly, she slipped and almost fell.\nKlein, who was also buying a ticket, opened his mouth. He wanted to help his sister, but he could only retract the hand he had instinctively extended and stood helplessly in the busy crowd.\nBenson jumped in fright, but he was too late to help. However, Melissa quickly steadied herself. She puckered her lips and said nothing.\nAt this moment, clowns swarmed forward, some performing balancing acts on wheels or large rubber balls, others tossing countless tennis balls into the air, then ridiculously catching every one of them.\nMelissa seemed to disregard the clowns as she looked at the performance. Benson tried to lift his sister's spirits by cheering, but he didn't succeed. He slowly turned sullen too.\nKlein puckered his lips tightly as he watched this scene from afar. He wanted to approach them, but he didn't dare to.\nSuddenly, he touched the wallet in his jacket and had an idea.\nBenson and Melissa continued walking forward, silently watching the various performances.\nSome time later, they saw a clown running towards them. His face was painted in colorful pastels. At first, he threw a tennis ball into the air, and, while the attention of the surrounding people was drawn to the air, he conjured a flower out of thin air. It was a Seville Chrysanthemum.\nThe clown brought the flower before Melissa and Benson. The flower was golden in color and symbolized happiness.\nMelissa and Benson looked at the clown in a daze. All they saw was a wide smile plastered over the pastel face. It was a happy smile, an exaggerated smile, a ridiculous smile.\n(End of the First Volume)"}
{"num_chp":93,"summary":"Above the gray fog, gigantic stone columns held up a majestic divine hall.\nTwo dark red blobs extended out into faint human figures by the side of the ancient mottled bronze table.\n\"Good afternoon, Mr. Fool.\" Augmented with a blurry effect, Audrey greeted him with a bow and smiled. \"It is unfortunate that there is no wine here; otherwise, we could have a toast to your successful trial.\"\nShe was referring to the ritualistic magic.\n\"You are more powerful than we imagined,\" Alger Wilson praised as well.\nKlein was surrounded by the thick fog as usual. He pressed down with his right arm and spoke with his normal tone, replying as though it was natural.\n\"Great, this means that we are on the path of excellence. If you have any matters to tend to that leave you unable to attend the gathering on Mondays, conduct the ritual and inform me. All you have to do is change the line in the incantation \u2018I pray for a good dream' with the reason.\"\n\"Alright,\" Audrey quickly agreed. \"Mr. Fool, I obtained another page of Emperor Roselle's diary. I believe I still owe you one page.\"\n\"I was away from land this week and haven't found any new pages.\" Alger placed his right hand near his chest and bowed in apology.\n\"No matter. I expected my request to take a long time.\" Klein leaned back into his chair and tapped the armrest with his index finger. He looked at Miss Justice and said, \"You can express the contents of the diary now.\"\nAudrey bowed slightly and said, \"As you wish.\"\nA pen suddenly appeared before her. She recalled the symbols that she had memorized and tried her best to transcribe them.\nIn seconds, she saw that the goatskin was already filled with content. The strange symbols neatly covered the entire page.\nAfter checking the contents, she put down the fountain pen and said, \"It's done.\"\nKlein raised his hand and the goatskin parchment appeared in his palm.\nShifting his gaze down, he started reading without emotion.\n\"July 9th. I suddenly thought of an interesting question. Since the Sequence pathways are also called the \u2018Blessings of The Divinities' or \u2018Pathways of The Divinities', then why would the stone slate that records the completed twenty-two Sequence pathways be called the \u2018Blasphemy Slate'. Blasphemy, what an interesting term... Just who is the one blasphemed?\n\"And who created the Blasphemy Slate? How could that person hold all of the Sequence pathways? Just what other information was on the stone? I really want to see it...\n\"July 12th. I've realized another fact today. The Sealed Artifacts are an important component of a church's overall strength, even though some of the sealed items are very, very dangerous. Among the seven churches, the God of Craftsmanship wields the least number of Sealed Artifacts which are also relatively less dangerous... Did I join an organization without a future? No, I should think of it this way; only a blank piece of paper can produce a good painting. A weak organization is the best place for me to display my abilities!\n\"July 14th. I saw that mysterious Mr. Zaratul again. I never expected him to be the leader of an ancient organization, the Secret Order!\"\nKlein's pupils constricted when he read this. He nearly revealed an unnatural expression.\nThe Zaratul family only had a certain connection with the Secret Order in the notes of the Church of the Evernight Goddess. But now, he learned from Emperor Roselle that the mysterious Mr. Zaratul was further determined to be the leader of the Secret Order.\nFrom the looks of it, it is an unquestionable fact that the Secret Order holds the Seer Sequence pathway...\nWhile Klein was reading the diary, Audrey looked over and began observing him out of habit.\nHowever, her field of vision was completely obscured by the thick fog.\nMomentarily taken aback, Audrey snapped back to her senses and turned her head frantically to look at the other illusory dark red star.\nI was too reckless, too insolent, too foolish in trying to observe Mr. Fool... I was lucky, lucky that he isn't angry.Audrey stuck out her tongue secretly and pretended to admire the scenery. She was just short of humming a lively tune.\nAlger sat silently, his gaze never leaving the long bronze table. He knew his place, as if he was in the presence of a true god.\nKlein collected himself and scanned the last portion of the diary.\n\"After learning that I had become a Savant, Mr. Zaratul mentioned that I had chosen a difficult, yet relatively safe path. I asked him why that was the case, but all he did was smile before telling me that the Sequence pathway contains secrets beyond my imagination. I couldn't help but ask him which Sequence pathway he selected. He told me that his Sequence 9 was Seer.\n\"I intentionally mocked him and asked if every Seer only disclosed half-truths, never explaining things more clearly. Furthermore, he was clearly a powerful High-Sequence Beyonder. There was no need for him to continue acting as a Seer!\n\"Mr. Zaratul told me that it was a habit he adopted from back when he was a Seer, and that this was a method that could pique my curiosity and make me cooperate with him. He hoped that I could help him steal a dangerous sealed item from the Church of the God of Craftsmanship, a relic of the Antigonus family.\n\"Clearly, this must wait until I become a core member of the Church of the God of Craftsmanship. I asked Mr. Zaratul how long it would take to digest the potion if I used the acting method, and what standards I should use to determine if I had digested it completely.\n\"He told me that for the lower Sequences, it would only take half a year to digest the potion as long as one strictly used the acting method. In fact, in the fastest case, it might only take a month. And standard measure for progress was simple; every Beyonder would sense it immediately once the potion was completely digested. It is what it is.\n\"I asked him for more details, but he merely smiled at me.\n\"To hell with his smiles, I'll beat up every Seer I see when I become a High-Sequence Beyonder!\"\n...Rest in peace, Emperor...Klein read the diary several times before looking at Justice and The Hanged Man again.\n\"Sorry for the wait.\"\n\"It is our honor.\" Audrey was still shocked, forgetting that she was a Spectator.\nShe looked at The Hanged Man and organized her words.\n\"Where can I find the Psychology Alchemists?\"\nPsychology Alchemists...Klein suddenly recalled the man buying supplementary ingredients for the Spectator potion at the Tingen underground market.\nPerhaps he was a member of the Psychology Alchemists?\nJust as Klein was considering how to get closer to that man, The Hanged Man, Alger Wilson shook his head and said, \"Miss Justice, firstly, I don't have a clue. Secondly, I don't think there's any rush in seeking out the Psychology Alchemists. What you should focus on now is completely digesting the Spectator potion.\"\nAudrey glanced at The Fool and noticed that he didn't have any intention of adding to the conversation. She nodded in disappointment and said, \"All I want is to have plenty of time to prepare so that I can approach them more naturally. Alright, then when can I digest the Spectator potion and stop acting? Is there a standard that indicates when I can? I'm almost at the point where I no longer feel frustrated, nor do I hear the constant murmuring anymore.\"\nAlger looked at The Fool in the fog but saw that he didn't have any intention of speaking. He then deliberated before saying, \"If you don't use the acting method, the typical rule of thumb is to wait three years and confirm that you no longer feel restless or receive any auditory or visual illusions. There is one simple test to determine when you can. That method is to exhaust your body to its limit. If you still don't hear any maniacal murmurings or see any strange things at that point, that would mean that you're ready to advance.\"\n\"With regards to the acting method, I have also just come into contact with it. It feels good, so I don't think it'll take three years.\"\nThat wasn't useful at all... Three years, that's too long...Audrey criticized inwardly.\nShe had just thought about this when she heard an armrest being tapped.\nAudrey froze, then turned her head in joy. She saw The Fool tapping on the edge of the long table.\nAlger sat straighter, waiting for The Fool to speak.\nKlein said in his normal tone, \"For Low-Sequence Beyonders, as long as you strictly stick to acting, you should be able to digest the medicine in half a year. It's even possible to do it in a month.\"\nHe looked at Justice and added, \"As for the signs of digestion, you'll know it when it comes. It doesn't need to be taught.\"\n\"One month... Great! Thank you, Mr. Fool!\" Audrey exclaimed while brimming with joy.\nMiss Justice, don't think that you are the chosen one. The key point is half a year...Klein lifted his right hand and placed it beside his lips.\n\"Half a year...\" Alger repeated softly.\nAudrey sensed joy, relief, and intense doubt in his tone.\nWhat is he suspicious about?Audrey thought as she asked, \"Mr. Fool, have you considered adding more members?\"\nKlein leaned back casually. He had long prepared an answer.\n\"This started as a trial, so I didn't spend much time thinking about extending our meetings.\n\"But now, as a regular gathering, we must choose our members carefully. Secrecy is our motto.\"\nAudrey nodded gently and said, \"That is to say that we have to follow a process of observation, recommendation, and testing process. Yes, a process.\"\n\"You can interpret it that way,\" Klein affirmed.\nIn his mind he was thinking about how he could inquire about the Secret Order and the Clown potion.\nHow can I ask questions in a way that befits my status?Klein was placed in a difficult spot.\nAt that moment, realizing that Justice temporarily had nothing else to say, Alger took the initiative to speak, \"I've heard that a Listener from the Aurora Order is searching for traces of the True Creator, which is the holy residence they advocate.\"\n\"True Creator?\" Audrey asked, puzzled.\n\"It is an ancient entity worshiped by numerous secret organizations and cults. They believe that the Creator hasn't completely perished. The Core he left behind is the True Creator.\" Alger gave a rough explanation. \"Since the Fifth Epoch, the True Creator has appeared in many forms, such as The Hanged Giant or the Eye behind the Shadow Curtains. Heh heh, many people believe that Emperor Roselle referenced the imagery of the True Creator when he was creating the tarot cards; hence, there exists the card of The Hanged Man.\"\nAt this point, he looked at Klein and said, \"Mr. Fool, there's nothing with what I said, right?\"\nIs he trying to probe for my views on the True Creator?Klein thought about the bloody man on the cross that the Captain saw in Hanass Vincent's dream and immediately had an idea.\nDoesn't both the hanging and the shadows imply evil connotations?\nTherefore, he chuckled and said, \"I am more inclined to call him, the Fallen Creator.\""}
{"num_chp":42,"summary":"A mission request... You probably came to the wrong place... This security company's signboard is really nothing but a signboard...\nKlein immediately held back his urge to lampoon when he heard the visitor. How he yearned for there to be a message board and a screen for him to share his thoughts.\nBut he soon realized that he had once asked a similar question. The captain's answer was that they could take on jobs if they were free. The money earned could be used as funding for the team's petty cash account and bonuses for the participants.\nRozanne's eyes darted around as she thought for a moment before saying, \"Our security personnel are all out on missions. The fastest it will take for them to return is an hour. If your matter isn't urgent, you can consider our services.\"\nAmong the six formal Nighthawk members, Captain Dunn Smith had been invited to the cathedral by the bishop for some unknown discussion. Leonard Mitchell was guarding Chanis Gate in his place.\nCorpse Collector Frye and Sleepless Royale Reideen had already headed to the Golden Indus Borough to assist the police in the investigation of a robbery case with cultist inklings. Sleepless Kenley White was on leave, while Midnight Poet Seeka Tron had gone to Raphael Cemetery in the north suburb for a daily patrol.\nAs for the remaining two Beyonders, Old Neil was frail and too advanced in his years. He had not taken any missions in a long time. Klein was still a novice and was truly inadequate in various aspects.\n\"They are all out...\" With one hand holding his umbrella, the lanky man's expression turned gloomy as he took off his hat. He bowed and said, \"Sorry for intruding. Goodbye.\"\nHe turned around and walked out. He went down the stairs and left 36 Zouteland Street amid the spattering rain and howling winds.\n\"What a bloody pity.\" Rozanne watched the man left and sighed regretfully.\nAlthough she would not have gotten any share of the commission, she definitely would have been able to partake in a sumptuous meal.\n\"There's nothing we can do about it. Chanis Gate needs someone watching it all the time.\" Klein put down his cutlery in satisfaction. Even though he did not like the soup mixture of turnips and vegetables, he still drank it clean. \"Don't tell me you want Bredt to take the mission? Or yourself?\"\nRozanne rolled her eyes and giggled.\n\"Bredt won't do, but you can. Our Mister Seer...\"\nThe moment she finished her sentence, she immediately realized what she had just said. She covered her mouth in shock because the door had not been fully closed. It someone walked past outside or heard anything about Beyonders, it would be considered a leak.\n\"Thankfully Captain isn't around...\" Rozanne looked out the door and secretly stuck her tongue out. \"Or I'll have to go for confession again!\"\nBredt and Klein laughed out in unison as they exchanged looks before beginning to put away the cutlery.\nAfter everything was done, Klein, who did not bring his umbrella, decided to stay at Blackthorn Security Company due to the ongoing rain.\nHe took out some newspapers and sat on the soft but bouncy sofa as he leisurely began his \u2018afternoon break.'\n\"The airship route from Backlund to Desi Bay is now in service...\"\n\"The complete anthology of the Great Detective Manseng is publishing soon...\"\n\"An advertisement for Lagolas Weapons? A standard model revolver carrying six bullets costs three pounds and ten soli, a double barrel gun costs two pounds...\"\n...\nKlein flipped through the Tingen City Honest Paper when a particular piece of news suddenly caught his attention.\n\"...the suspect responsible for killing Mr. Welch and Miss Naya has been caught. We believe it is a much-needed reprieve from the horror that has gripped North Borough, Golden Indus Borough, and East Borough... Welch's father, Mr. McGovern, who is a banker, has escorted his youngest son's corpse back to Constant City where a grand burial will be held...\"\nAfter reading it a few times, Klein suddenly sighed.\nFrom the looks of it, Welch's father had bought the police's explanations and did not hire a private investigator to investigate the matter...\nHis grief from losing his youngest son can't be any greater than that of my parents who lost their only son...\nIn a sullen mood, Klein sat there motionless for a long time.\nHe neither found it odd that he was not invited to Welch's and Naya's burials, nor did he feel depressed.\nOnce everything calms down, I'll find a chance to offer a bouquet of flowers to their graves...Klein was about to take a nap in the break room when a knock came from the door of the reception hall again.\n\"Please come in.\" Rozanne, who was nodding off, suddenly jolted awake.\nThe half-closed door was pushed open again. The lanky man from before walked in once again.\n\"Can I wait here? Your mercenaries, no- security personnel should be back soon, right?\" He asked sincerely, trying his best to hide his anxious expression.\n\"Sure. Please have a seat.\" Rozanne pointed at the sofa nearby.\nKlein asked out of curiosity, \"Where did you hear about our security company? Who introduced you here?\"\nHe had made two trips despite the heavy afternoon storm while still willing to wait?\nYes. The Nighthawks must have easily resolved missions that might seem very difficult to others. They must have accrued quite a reputation...\nThe man left his umbrella outside the door and as he walked to the sofa, he replied with a rueful smile, \"I have traveled the nearby streets and paid a visit to all the mercenaries, uh-security companies and private investigators. You are my only hope. The others do not have the manpower to take additional missions... To be frank, if not for the waiter that delivers meals, I really did not imagine that there was another security company here.\"\n...It's completely different from what I imagined...Klein was stunned.\nRozanne interjected with a question, \"They are very busy? Are there that many missions?\"\nThe man sat down and sighed.\n\"You are a mercenary team, no-a security company. I believe you must have heard of the armed burglary murder at Howes Street?\"\nHowes Street... Armed burglary murder... Alright, unfortunately, I'm one of the people involved... Klein nodded with a slightly heavy heart.\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Due to the presence of a ferocious and cruel criminal, the rich men living in the neighboring streets, and even across all of Tingen City, are terrified. Apart from increasing the numbers of their security detail, they have also hired many more security personnel and private detectives. This resulted in a shortage of supply in your line of work,\" the tall and skinny man explained clearly.\nA standard chain-reaction...Klein and Rozanne exchanged looks and saw the self-deprecating smile from each other's faces.\nThe security industry had entered a golden age. Yet, Blackthorn Security Company was not affected in any way. It was apparent how dismally the company was run.\nOf course, to a certain extent, it also proved the success of the Nighthawks in hiding themselves.\nAfter waiting for another twenty plus minutes, Klein prepared to leave since the rain was coming to a stop. He planned on practicing at the Shooting Club.\nAt that moment, the black-haired and green-eyed Leonard Mitchell walked out of the partition. He looked curiously at the sofa.\n\"This is?\"\n\"A client. Is Captain back?\" Rozanne asked delightfully.\n\"Back?\" The lanky man was taken aback when he heard that.\nHe had been sitting there, staring at the door. How did he not discover someone's return?\nRozanne's expression immediately froze as she chuckled.\n\"As a security company, we don't only use the front door.\"\n\"Figures.\" The lanky man nodded in enlightenment.\nHe was also not surprised by the term \u2018Captain.' Security companies were mercenary teams or small-scale mercenary guilds. It was normal for \u2018Captain' to be used.\nLeonard did not tuck in his white shirt. His black vest was also casually draped on. He took a glance at the lanky man when he suddenly snapped his fingers and said, \"I'm a member of the security personnel at Blackthorn. How might I address you? How may I help you?\"\nPerhaps it was because he had long heard about the unrestrained characters of mercenaries that he did not feel the anger of being humiliated. Instead, he let out a breath of relief.\nHe watched Leonard sit down, and organized his words.\n\"My name is Klee, a butler of Mr. Vickroy, a tobacco merchant. His only son, little Elliott, was kidnapped this morning. We have already informed the police and the matter has been given high priority. However, Mr. Vickroy remains uneasy. He wishes to go through the channels which mercenaries, uh-security personnel have, as well as your understanding of Tingen, to investigate the case from a different angle and ensure that little Elliott is rescued safely.\"\n\"If you are able to find where the kidnappers are hiding, Mr. Vickroy will be willing to pay you 100 pounds. If you have the means to successfully save Young Master Elliott, he is willing to pay double. 200 pounds.\"\nLeonard Mitchell smiled leisurely.\n\"Mr. Vickroy seems to only wish for us to find the kidnappers' hideout? If not, he will not think that his only son is worth a hundred pounds. A tobacco merchant who has close ties with the southern plantations will not just offer two hundred pounds.\"\n\"No, Mr. Vickroy is only an ordinary merchant. He's not considered wealthy. Besides, he believes the police will be more professional when it comes to rescuing his son,\" Klee answered frankly.\n\"Alright. No problem.\" Leonard snapped his fingers again.\nHis green eyes turned their gaze on Rozanne.\n\"My beautiful lady, please write up a contract.\"\n\"Don't always act like a poet. In fact, all you do is recite the works of others.\" Having forgotten the presence of the client, Rozanne quipped. She was used to exchanging snipes with Leonard.\nOf course, the Blackthorn Security Company did not really care about its clients. It was great to have them, but it was also fine not having them.\nRozanne left the reception counter and entered the staff office. Soon, there were sounds of typing coming out from the office.\nThe corners of Klein's mouth twitched a little. He found them too unprofessional.\nThere was no standard template for a contract!\nThis sure is tragic...\nAnd more saddening is the fact that I'm working at such an unprofessional company...\nThe moment these thoughts arose in him, Rozanne completed a simple contract that had only a few clauses. Then, Klee and Leonard Mitchell signed it.\nAfter Klee stamped it, she took the contract and returned to the accounting room and got Mrs. Orianna to stamp it with the Blackthorn Security Company logo-something that was actually useless. Dunn typically handed it to Orianna for safekeeping. On Sunday, it would be passed to Rozanne and company.\n\"I'll wait for your good news.\" After receiving one copy of the contract, Klee stood up and bowed with his hat off.\nLeonard did not respond. He seemed to be in deep thought.\nHe suddenly turned his head toward Klein and revealed a smile.\n\"I need your help.\"\n\"Ah?\" Klein was taken aback.\n\"I mean you and I can finish this mission together.\" The corners of Leonard's mouth curved up slightly as he explained, \"I'm good at combat, shooting, climbing, sensing, and chanting, and taking on some support roles. But that does not include looking for people. You don't expect Old Neil to go out in such weather, right?\"\nWhen he said \u2018sensing,' his voice was lowered to a mumble that Klein could barely hear.\n\"Alright.\" Klein did have the urge to attempt his new \u2018abilities,' while also feeling a little wary toward Leonard Mitchell.\nPhew. Let's hope it will be completed successfully... I wonder how useful my Seer abilities will be...He wondered with some anticipation."}
{"num_chp":1158,"summary":"Chapter 1158 Coming to Terms\nAfter silently staring at the rabbits and mountain goats for more than ten seconds, Klein closed his eyes and flicked his right index finger and middle finger as if he was pressing an invisible piano key.\nA third of the marionette collapsed, losing the feeling of being alive.\nKlein's expression immediately warped, as though he had been struck 33 times by a giant sword.\nThe familiar and extreme pain he felt swept through his Spirit Body, causing light-colored meat tendrils to sprout on his body. Every sprout seemed to be forming a transparent maggot.\nThis was the backlash from killing 33 Worms of Spirit.\nAfter taking nearly fifteen minutes to recover, Klein made his second attempt at letting the other third of his marionettes die.\nThe same pain, the same time to rest, and the same actions were repeated again. Finally, he completely finished off this batch of cursed marionettes.\nHe couldn't handle it all at once because the damage caused by the death of a hundred Worms of Spirit was enough to make him lose control. And being cursed meant that he couldn't directly solve the problem by retrieving the characteristics.\nOf course, this was the standard of a Scholar of Yore who had just advanced recently; it wasn't the performance of a Scholar of Yore who was almost done digesting the potion.\nIn fact, the loss of a hundred Worms of Spirit would only worsen the pain, without him showing any signs of losing control or affecting the battle. He was only acting just now, allowing his performance to match his role.\nAt his level, losing half the number of Worms of Spirit that he had at the same time would lead to losing control.\nOnce he completely digested the Scholar of Yore potion, he would be able to recover from having nearly 500 Worms of Spirit die at once. Even if he lost all the corresponding Beyonder characteristics, he wouldn't lose his status and level. He could slowly recover his strength by absorbing the Beyonder characteristics of the Seer pathway.\nAfter completing this, the recovered Klein walked out of the half-collapsed tower-like building. He went to the darkness outside and brought back a few white rabbits and a goat.\nHe then realized that the darkness in the Forsaken Land of the Gods wasn't as dangerous as Little Sun had described. Most of the monsters were weak.\nNo, to be precise, the danger lurking in the depths of the darkness, apart from making people evaporate into thin air, nothing else can compare to the fellow beside me named Amon... Klein glanced at the thin man who was sitting near the lantern, smiling as \"He\" watched him busy himself. He summoned something like boiled water from the Historical Void, and he squatted down, seriously removing the fur and flesh from the white rabbits and goat.\nAfter a series of tasks, Klein set up a bonfire. He set up a barbecue rack that came from history, and he placed a white rabbit on it. He brushed it with a full set of condiments he made himself, like basil, fennel, and salt, as he constantly turned the meat over.\nAt this moment, the delicacies from the Historical Void he had eaten before had long disappeared due to him no longer maintaining their existence. His body and soul were calling out for replenishment.\nA tempting fragrance was gradually emanated as Amon's nose twitched slightly.\n\"You're really eating them?\"\nWithout waiting for his reply, the God of Mischief continued, \"They're essentially the flesh of monsters and your Worms of Spirit. Are you sure you want to eat them?\"\n\"There's no way to undo the curse at the level of an angel. If there's no way to resist or correct it at the same level, there's no way of dispelling it. Since a thing looks like a rabbit, smells like a rabbit, and tastes like a rabbit, it's a rabbit.\" As Klein seriously roasted the rabbit, he gave a self-deprecating laugh. \"Besides, how can I not maintain the best state if I want to escape from your grasp? For this sliver of hope, I can only challenge my psychological limits.\"\nThis is what it means to endure humiliation and suffering! Klein added inwardly.\nAt the same time, he sighed at the Ancient Bane's Transformation Curse.\nThis was many times stronger than a Sequence 3 Disciple of Silence's curse!\nThere's almost no limit to the amount of time it can be maintained... Clearly, an ordinary animal can use all of my Beyonder powers through the Worm of Spirit, but a deformed marionette due to a curse isn't possible... This is a curse at the angel level... Apart from putting up resistance from someone at the same level, one can use the correct method to remove it. No curse is irreversible. There are always loopholes... Heh heh, will kissing this rabbit turn it into Gehrman Sparrow? Klein made a self-deprecating comment as he analyzed to compose himself.\nAfter hearing his reply, the monocled Amon, nodded with a smile.\n\"Very good.\n\"This is indeed a good revelation to have.\"\nKlein didn't respond as he resumed his barbecue.\nNot long after, with the help of Flame Controlling, he finished roasting a rabbit and a goat's leg. Taking advantage of the opportunity before the condiments disappeared, he matched some sweet ice tea he summoned from the Historical Void with the food, filling his mouth with fragrance. It nourished his body and mind, allowing him to effectively relieve the pressure, despair, and indecisiveness from being \"kidnapped\" by Amon.\nDuring this process, he would occasionally recall the disgusting looks of the monsters, as well as the fact that the Worms of Spirit were equivalent to himself. However, he was able to bring his feelings under control very well.\nAfter filling his stomach and replenishing his energy, he turned the remaining ingredients next to the fire into dry rations, as though he was saving up for his subsequent plans.\nSeeing him slowly but orderly making all sorts of preparations, Amon suddenly nudged his monocle and asked with a slight smile, \"In actuality, you're trying to stall for time before we reach the actual destination, right?\"\nKlein's hands paused for a moment before he continued with his actions. He smiled and said, \"Yes, I'm waiting for help.\n\"Guess who?\"\nAmon didn't answer directly as \"He\" said with a smile, \"I'm looking forward to it.\"\nKlein continued his work until he prepared rations for three or four meals.\nHe thought for a moment and once again reached his hand into the void in front of Amon. He failed again and again as he kept making attempts. It was unknown what item he was trying to summon, but it seemed like he was using his actions to dare Amon into stealing it.\nAfter watching for a few seconds, Amon smiled and shook \"His\" head. \"He\" slowly stood up and walked out the half- collapsed tower building.\nKlein's right hand stopped in mid-air before he retracted it and pinched his forehead.\nHe muttered to himself in puzzlement, \"What was I trying to do just now...\"\nWhile trying to recall, Klein stood up as well. He brought along his packed rations, picked up the animal hide lantern, and walked to the back of Amon's side.\nThe man and angel circled around the hill and entered a valley.\nThe water was sloshing in the river, but when the dim yellow light shone at it, or when the lightning in the sky lit up the area, Klein realized that there was no water in the riverbed. The sounds he had heard earlier had also disappeared.\n\"A river that has been transferred into a concealed state?\" After some deliberation, he raised a question to Amon.\n\"That's right. It will only appear in darkness void of light,\" Amon replied with a slight nod, unfazed with the question.\n\"Can I drink it?\" Klein pressed.\nAmon smiled and said, \"Sure. This was once one of the water sources of a city that had persisted for 1600 years in the darkness. As long as you can bring the water away from the riverbed, they can appear in places with light.\nYour next move is to suggest that I bring the lantern to wait by the side while you hydrate yourself in the darkness? \"And then, take this opportunity to transform into a concealed state?\"\nKlein smiled awkwardly.\n\"How could I use such a simple method?\"\nHearing that, Amon laughed and stroked \"His\" monocle.\n\"Sometimes, the simplest plan is the most effective. You can give it a try.\"\nWith regards to the words of this peerless swindler, Klein couldn't believe it, nor did he dare to believe it. He was afraid that the other party was using reverse psychology with the truth.\nHe could only put the matter of the water aside and ask, \"In the Forsaken Land of the Gods, how many human gathering points, like the City of Silver, have yet to be destroyed?\"\nAmon looked ahead and said without changing \"His\" expression, \"The ones I know don't exceed ten.\n\"In this aspect, the City of Silver is lucky. At least, they can see and have the ability to touch the light.\"\nThis means that the City of Silver is very close to the Giant King's Court, the door leading out of the Forsaken Land of the Gods. There's no need to risk death to reach it. As for the other cities, no matter how steadfast they are in the darkness, no matter how many exploration teams they send out, it will all be futile. There's no way to find the exit? Indeed, from this angle, the City of Silver is unfortunate, and also lucky... This is purely dependent on the reference point... Klein held the lantern as he proceeded along the bank and began coming up with his second attempt at escaping.\nAmon walked beside him, occasionally providing him with ideas that seemed reliable but had unknown actual results. \"He\" appeared to be suffering from schizophrenia, trying \"His\" best to destroy \"His\" true body's hopes in obtaining Sefirah Castle.\nOn the other side of the Giant King's Court, in the City of Silver.\nAfter receiving the Chiefs summoning call, Derrick Berg brought the Unshadowed Crucifix to the top of the spire and entered a spacious room.\nThere was a mysterious and complicated altar set up here. Different items were placed in different spots-a total of six items, each of them emanating a dangerous aura.\nWith a glance, Derrick saw an ordinary silver flute, a mask made from a skull, and the remains of a deformed person. \"You have the Unshadowed Crucifix. You can stay here for fifteen minutes, but you can't exceed that time. Otherwise, you will suffer a sudden death.\" Colin Iliad wore a linen shirt and a brown coat as he exhorted Derrick.\nDerrick's spiritual perception was triggered as he asked, \"Your Excellency, is this because of that Twilight Mask?\"\nHis right hand pointed at the mask made from a skull.\n\"Yes.\" Colin nodded slightly and said, \"I've already prepared the remains of six powerful creatures. These were all hunted by myself, or with me as the main force.\"\nDerrick was immediately enlightened.\n\"You still lack the blessings of a deity?\"\nColin instantly fell silent. After nearly ten seconds, he opened his mouth and slowly said, \"Yes.\"\nAfter some hesitation and struggles, he finally chose The Fool.\nAt least those mushrooms had given the City of Silver hope.\nDerrick suppressed his joy and thought back to the interactions at the Tarot Club. He raised a question in puzzlement: \"Why didn't you let those two god-level Sealed Artifacts give you their blessings?\"\nHe remembered that subsidiary gods-or angels-could satisfy the requirements of the ritual. It wasn't the case that only a Sequence 0 true deity could provide blessings. After all, a Silver Knight was only a Sequence 3.\nColin fell silent again and hesitated for a few seconds before saying, \"They won't give blessings.\""}
{"num_chp":1303,"summary":"\"Already dead...\"\nEdwards turned his head and looked at Bernadette's Invisible Servant with his light-blue eyes. His gaze was no longer cold and blank. It emitted a strange glint that was filled with disbelief.\nIt was only at this moment that he seemed to realize that he had long died and had come back to \"life.\" He was no different from William, Poli, and Grimm, who he claimed were individuals who they needed to keep up one's guard against.\nThis transformation lasted for only two seconds before Edwards's face twisted. His already pale skin rapidly dimmed as it ruptured inch by inch.\nBeneath his skin, the red pieces of flesh began to rot at a discernible speed, dripping foul yellow liquid.\nWith a swoosh, Edwards raised the black axe in his hand.\nOof!\nHis axe ruthlessly cleaved the top of his head, as though it was trying to stop the bad thoughts that surfaced in his mind.\nThe axe was heavy and sharp. It tore through Edwards's skull all the way to his glabella.\nDrip, drip, drip. Drops of milky-white cerebrospinal fluid dripped down from the axe's blade, sliding across Edwards's grimaced and torn face, as though he had poured some milk onto a bright red strawberry.\n\"Don't... Don't come near me...\" Edwards said in a low and hoarse voice to Bernadette's Invisible Servant after striking himself in the head.\nBefore he could finish his sentence, his expression returned to its blank state. The look in his eyes gradually turned hollow as he turned around and walked towards the forest.\nThat thin and shriveled body of his stooped a little, as though his back was hunched.\nBernadette had probed him because of the doubts and concerns she had about entering the mausoleum. All she could do was indirectly determine the problem with Edwards's existence, and see if she could obtain more clues from his answer. She never expected this knight from Roselle's era, who had been famous across the Northern Continent, would react in such an intense and strange manner.\nAfter two seconds of silence, Bernadette made the Invisible Servant say to Edwards's back:\n\"Your descendants are doing pretty well. All of them are accomplished in a certain sense.\"\nEdwards, whose back was facing the mausoleum, stopped for a moment. Then, he continued forward, passing the invisible boundary and entering the forest.\nHis target seemed to be in the direction of the cemetery with the stone pillar, the place where the deceased could obtain \"new life.\"\nAt the same time, Bernadette looked up into the sky.\nThe faint black colors that permeated the area had clearly faded, but there was an indescribable feeling. The entire primitive island underwent a subtle change that couldn't accurately be described.\nSuddenly, Bernadette, who was hiding at the edge of the invisible boundary, rubbed her back.\nShe felt that it was heavy, as though there was something there.\nWhen her left palm touched her target, Bernadette realized that there was an extra strand of hair.\nAt this moment, she was wearing an Intis-styled blouse with a large lace flower around the collar, an indigo patterned captain's uniform, a pair of beige trousers, knee-length boots, and a triangular hat with feathers on it. She was dressed like the leader of a pirate ship.\nShe styled herself such that her long chestnut hair was tied into a bun, leaving the remaining strands in a way that would reach the middle of her back. But now, even though her hairstyle remained unchanged, her hair had grown longer and reached her waist.\nThen, Bernadette lowered her head and looked at her right palm. She saw the fingernails of her five fingers extending.\nQueen Mystic didn't show any signs of surprise or panic. She followed the instincts of a Clairvoyant and from all the experience she had accumulated over time. She took a few steps forward, and through an invisible boundary, she completely left the primitive forest and entered the empty area where the Black Emperor's mausoleum was.\nDuring this process, Bernadette even made the Invisible Servant return to the spirit world.\nThree or four seconds later, she felt the earth shake. The mausoleum began to tremble visibly.\nSubconsciously, Bernadette turned to look at the primitive forest.\nHer gaze froze for a moment.\nThe dark-green trees were waving their branches and uprooting their roots. Then, like humans, they approached Bernadette.\nThe entire primitive forest had come to \"life\"!\nLooking at the dense cluster of trees that seemed to blot out the sky surging at her, Bernadette had the feeling that doomsday was approaching. She felt as if the entire area would be blanketed by the forest.\nA gigantic red dragon with flames flowing across its skin rapidly flew into the sky. An eight-legged demonic wolf began to run madly between the trees... All the supernatural beings and mutated creatures on this island stirred as they rushed towards the mausoleum.\nAlthough she was a Clairvoyant, Bernadette still didn't expect that her simple, indirect question would bring about such an anomaly. It was as though it was a key that had opened the door to the abyss.\nAbove the gray fog, Klein saw a lot more. Together with his knowledge of mysticism, he had a certain guess.\nThe situation of Edwards is different from William, Grimm, and Poli. It's like a loophole of the order on this primitive island, or rather, a shadow...\nWhen he realized that he was already dead, this loophole was discovered by the order, and it began to conduct \"repairs.\"\nAnd the repairs brought with it an enhancement of the order, causing the entire island to experience an anomaly.\nI can sense that the Black Emperor's powers are present here to a certain degree. It affected Edwards, causing him to maintain a portion of his will after obtaining new \"life.\" And where did the original order of this primitive island come from?\nEh...\nAs Klein's thoughts raced, he suddenly sensed that Bernadette was suffering certain anomalies.\nThump, thump, thump. Bernadette could vaguely hear her own heartbeat.\nThis heartbeat was rather chaotic, as though it was a combination of two sounds.\nTwo... Bernadette's heart stirred as she calmly directed her attention back to herself.\nIn the next second, she confirmed that there were two sources of her heartbeat.\nOne came from her heart, the other from her abdomen.\nThere seemed to be an additional heart in her abdomen, one that was rapidly expanding and contracting.\nFurthermore, this \"heart\" was developing bit by bit!\nWithout needing to use her Mystery Prying powers to look at her abdomen, Bernadette immediately sensed that there was a fetus in her womb.\nIt had grown from the size of a grape to the size of a normal human palm. If it was left to grow, it didn't seem like it would take long before it matured. It would then tear open her mother's womb, and drill out while covered in blood.\nUnknowingly, Bernadette had become pregnant. Her spiritual perception and the Sealed Artifact on her body had failed to detect it in advance or attempt to stop it. It was as though she was powerless to deal with such an influence.\nEarth Mother... Primordial Moon... Mother Tree of Desire... Three divine names flashed through Bernadette's mind.\nAccording to what she knew, there weren't many mysteries that could cause such an anomaly. Most of them came from domains related to the Earth and the Moon pathway.\nSequence 0 of the Planter pathway was Mother. The Primordial Moon could make a stone have reproductive powers, while the Mother Tree of Desire seemed to possess some High-Sequence Beyonder characteristics of the Moon pathway.\nBernadette wasn't in a hurry to deal with the fetus in her stomach. Her gaze turned dark once again as she used her prophetic ability to see what her best choice was.\nThis time, she only took one second to obtain the corresponding prophecy:\n\"Survival lies inside the mausoleum.\"\nWithout any hesitation, Bernadette reached out her right hand and quickly drew out words filled with stellar radiance.\nThese words, which were similar to the words on the Blasphemy Slate, quickly interwove into a strange symbol and opened a secret door that seemed to lead deep into the spirit world.\nFollowing that, the \"secret door\" opened and a strong gust of wind blew out, transforming into an entity that was half-man, half-air. His upper body was wrapped in white cloth.\n\"Sage Frontlet,\" Bernadette's tone was calm as she ordered in a dignified voice.\nThe man responded respectfully and removed an accessory from the white cloth wrapped around his body.\nThe core of this accessory was a vertical eye embedded with \"diamonds.\" It shimmered with pure light, exuding an abnormal holiness. It was filled with intelligence, but it also appeared cold without any warmth.\nBernadette then took the accessory and \"embedded\" it into the middle of her forehead.\nThis was a Grade 0 Sealed Artifact which Bernadette usually didn't carry with her, as the negative effects were too severe.\nHowever, at this moment, the Sage Frontlet had an ability that was extremely important to Bernadette. She was willing to bear the consequences of not being able to use evil magic and the gradual influence that the Beyonder characteristic would have on her as it slowly fused with her.\nIf she didn't remove the Sage Frontlet in a short period of time, it would be equivalent to having a Sequence 2 potion splashed on her. When the time came, she could either end up lucky and succeed in advancing to become a Sage, or lose control and become a monster. And without the supplementary ingredients and the corresponding ritual, the former's probability was nearly negligible.\nWith the diamond vertical eye on her forehead, Bernadette's body began to turn incorporeal as she dissociated into a series of complicated knowledge.\nIn that instant, she became a creature of pure information.\nThe baby in her womb failed to obtain such a state as it fell to the ground.\nIt was half the size of a normal baby. It already had facial features and limbs. Its skin was wrinkled, and it was dripping with sticky pus.\nAs it left its mother's body, the undeveloped \"it\" began to regress and quickly melted in the air.\nThe baby was clearly unwilling to give up. It tried its best to open its eyes, which were sealed by the sticky liquid. It opened its mouth wide open in a bid to make a final struggle.\nAt this moment, Klein, who was above the gray fog, rapped the edge of the long mottled table.\nPa!\nHe increased the probability of failure with respect to the baby's struggling.\nUnable to maintain itself, the baby completely dissipated in front of the approaching black forest.\nAt the same time, the flood of information that Bernadette had transformed into had entered the Black Emperor mausoleum's interior through the heavy stone door as she reformed her original body.\nDuring this process, she seemed to see a black shadow."}
{"num_chp":130,"summary":"Klein looked at Swain standing before the monster's corpse before looking sideways towards the Mandated Punisher who was helping his semi-conscious partner up by the arm. Klein suddenly felt an indescribable sadness.\nIt was almost impossible for members of the Nighthawks, Mandated Punishers, and the Machinery Hivemind to be known as heroes. The things they did were never made known to the public but only hidden in confidential dockets. But the danger and pain they endured were ever so real.\nPerhaps there would be a day when my enemy will be one of my teammates...Klein sighed silently. He felt the heavy weight that all Nighthawks, Mandated Punishers, and Machinery Hivemind carried.\nAt that moment, Old Neil let out a sigh.\n\"Let's go. Let's not disturb them.\"\n\"Okay.\" Klein picked up his cane. Just as he widened his stride, he suddenly noticed that Old Neil was still holding his left hand. He asked, concerned, \"Are you hurt?\"\nOld Neil chuckled briefly before saying, \"I got stabbed by one of the shrapnel earlier. If I was still young, I definitely would've been able to dodge it. Luckily, it's just a small cut.\"\nHe moved his right hand slightly to let Klein see the tiny wound that was still lightly bleeding on the back of his left hand.\nAfter he confirmed that it wasn't a big issue, Klein walked off along the gangway as he sighed.\n\"Mr. Neil, you're much calmer than I imagined. Despite being less than two meters away from the monster, you could still chant the incantation calmly and use the charm.\"\nAlthough the rampaging Mandated Punisher had leaped towards Klein in the form of a monster, Old Neil was physically very close to him the entire time.\nOld Neil chucked at the compliment.\n\"I'm an experienced Nighthawk. Among the dangerous things that I've done, what happened just now isn't even in my top ten. Once, when I was patrolling Raphael Cemetery with Dunn, I had no idea that a corpse had turned into a zombie and left its tomb to lie in ambush in the shadows of the trees. I passed by without noticing it at all since I was looking for some hidden spot. Heh, you know what I mean. In the end, he leapt onto my back and seized my throat.\"\nKlein felt gripped by terror when he heard the recollection as he voiced out his guess.\n\"And under such a situation, you were still calm enough to use a charm? Or did you use some spell that a Mystery Pryer could cast quickly?\"\nOld Neil stole a glance at him and chortled. \"No, Dunn managed to drag that zombie into a slumber in time. I'm telling you this story to tell you that, as a Nighthawk, you not only have to believe in yourself, you also have to trust your teammates too.\"\nKlein fell silent for a few seconds. Then, he replied both sincerely and jokingly, \"Mr. Neil, you are so wise today.\"\nOld Neil did a tiny hop and found his footing on the pier. He replied in disdain, \"That's because you only get to know the most trivial side of me usually.\"\nThe two of them left the harbor and walked towards Evil Dragon Bar.\nKlein put away his revolver, set his cane aside, and took off his jacket. Under the light of the gas street lamp, he started checking if there was any damage to his jacket.\n\"How lucky. There are only a few splinters and a patch that got dirtied...\" He removed the splinters and roughly patted the dust away. Then, he put it back on.\nOld Neil looked at him with a smile and mimicked his tone by adding leisurely. \"What a pity, there's no way to claim compensation.\"\nKlein was temporarily at a loss for words.\nI'm not such a person!He emphasized in his heart.\nAs the public carriage arrived, Klein took out his silver vine-leaf pocket watch and flipped it open to check the time.\n\"If there's nothing else, I have to head home,\" he turned to tell Old Neil.\nOld Neil nodded slightly and said, \"Enjoy your dinner at home. You don't need to think about the Slumber Charm. I'll get Swain to compensate me. He's a rich man after all. Of course, I won't go today. I have to consider his mood.\"\nKlein opened his mouth, but in the end, he only said, \"... Thank you for your generosity.\"\nHe boarded the carriage quickly and returned to Daffodil Street. It was already past seven in the evening, and the sky had already grown dark.\nKlein took out his keys to open the door and saw Melissa taking off her fishnet hat and setting it on the clothes rack. He smiled and did small talk.\n\"You just got back?\"\nThen, his mixed emotions suddenly vanished, and he felt relaxed and warm.\n\"There was a practical lesson in school today,\" Melissa explained seriously.\nKlein sniffed and smelled the fragrance of food. He was stunned and asked subconsciously, \"Then, who's cooking dinner?\"\nThe moment he finished his sentence, both of them answered the question in unison, \"Benson!\"\nTheir tone had a hint of alarm.\nBenson, who had heard their conversation, walked out of the kitchen. While wiping his hands on an apron, he said, \"Do you have no confidence in my cooking? I remember that before Melissa learned how to cook, you two would wait for me to come home and watch me cook with anticipation. Actually, cooking is so easy. You want potato beef stew? Put in the beef first, then the potatoes, then add some seasoning...\"\nKlein and Melissa exchanged glances and remained silent.\nPutting aside his cane and took off his hat, Klein turned around and smiled.\n\"I think it's time to hire a maidservant. It's very unhealthy to not eat dinner on time.\"\n\"But I don't want to have a stranger next to us when we chat. That'll make me feel uncomfortable,\" Melissa said, subconsciously finding an excuse to object.\nKlein spoke with a smile as he took off his jacket.\n\"I don't mind...\"\nJust then, his expression froze, and he stopped what he was doing.\nI almost took off my jacket. I still have a revolver at my armpit...\nAhem.He cleared his throat and pretended nothing happened. \"Don't mind her. When we get home, we can let the maidservant rest in her room. I doubt any maidservant would dislike resting. Hmm, we must find a maidservant who's willing to learn how to cook.\"\nHe didn't want to endure the torture of a cuisine that left him guessing in the future.\nBenson stood at the kitchen and nodded in agreement.\n\"When we have time, we can go over to Tingen Family Servant Assistance Association. They have a great deal of experience and many resources in this field.\"\n\"Alright, it's decided then!\" Klein ignored Melissa's unwilling look.\n...\nBacklund, Empress Borough, Viscount Glaint's residence.\nAudrey Hall left the party with her personal maid, Annie. They came to the second floor and entered the bedroom that the Viscount had prepared.\nShe took off her glamorous dress and her lightweight dancing heels slowly with Annie's assistance. She then put on a black hooded robe that she had prepared ahead of time.\nPulling up the hood, Audrey stood before the full mirror and examined herself.\nShe saw that more than half her face was covered by the shadow of her hood, and only her beautiful lips were clearly exposed.\nLong black robe, face hidden by shadows, a mysterious feeling... This is something I've been dreaming of wearing all this time!Audrey thought to herself happily.\nWorried, she added a blue boat-shaped soft hat under her hood. With the fine checkered fishnet drooping down, her facial features became even more indiscernible.\n\"Not bad, that's it!\" Audrey stuffed her feet into leather ankle boots, looked to the side, and told Annie, \"Wait for me here. No matter who comes, do not open the door.\"\nAnnie looked at her helplessly and said, \"But you have to make sure that your trip doesn't take more than an hour.\"\n\"You should trust me. I have kept my promise every single time in the past.\" Audrey smiled and leaned in towards her personal maidservant. She hugged her and kissed her cheek as etiquette demanded.\nThen, she walked quickly and pulled up her hood. Turning around, she exited the bedroom through a secret door.\nShe walked all the way down and came to the side door of the viscount's residence where she saw that there was already a carriage waiting there.\nGlaint stood amidst the shadows as he glanced at Audrey and complimented sincerely, \"By dressing up like this, you are really, yeah-like the description Emperor Roselle often used-very cool.\"\n\"Thank you.\" Audrey pulled up an imaginary skirt and curtsied elegantly.\nThe two of them got into the carriage and left the villa. They arrived at a house about ten minutes away.\nOutside the house, Audrey saw Apprentice Fors Wall and her friend, Tribunal Xio Derecha, whom she had been seeing recently.\nFors's slightly wavy brown hair and her light blue eyes showed a natural laziness. She pointed at Xio Derecha next to her and said, \"She's an excellent persuader, capable of helping you get things that you want.\"\nXio Derecha was slightly shorter, about 150 cm at most. Her facial features were soft, but she seemed pretty young and immature.\nAlthough her shoulder length blond hair was messy and unkempt, and she was in a traditional knight training suit, she carried an indescribable look of dignity and a convincing charm.\nAudrey had met her a few times. She smiled faintly and greeted, \"Miss Xio, can I trust you?\"\n\"You don't have to worry at all.\" Xio Derecha smiled and gestured with her hand.\nJust as she walked to follow Audrey and Viscount Glaint, they heard a sudden thud.\nAudrey looked towards the source of the sound and saw that a triangular blade coruscating with a cold glimmer had fallen beside Xio Derecha's leg.\nAudrey and Xio Derecha exchanged looks, simultaneously at a loss for words.\nAfter nearly twenty seconds, Xio Derecha quickly squatted and picked up the triangular blade and hid it on her body.\n\"We have to prevent the occurrence of an accident. Some people lack rationality, and they aren't convinced easily,\" Xio Derecha explained seriously.\nAudrey nodded and replied with a clear voice, \"I believe you...\"\n\"These are tools to convince those b*stards to talk to us calmly,\" Fors added, looking sideways at the grass plains.\nThe quartet didn't continue conversing and walked a few steps forward. They knocked on the wooden door with three long and two short knocks.\nThe door squeaked and opened. Slowly, using her Spectator state, Audrey looked into the house that had many people sitting around randomly. They employed various methods such as hoods or masks to conceal their looks. Some didn't even bother and exposed their faces openly.\nAlmost instantly, Audrey noticed a black-robed man on a single seat sofa.\nThat man wore a hood too, hiding his looks under a shadow.\nHe looked at all the guests in silence, giving people a feeling that he was somehow in a commanding position.\nHe is very confident, but his gaze is very disgusting. His gaze moved up and down my body like two slippery tentacles wanting to tear off my clothes...Audrey's senses were sharp. She carefully observed and made a judgment calmly, but she nearly had goosebumps.\nFors introduced him.\n\"That's Mr. A, a powerful Beyonder, the leader of this secret gathering.\""}
{"num_chp":192,"summary":"Audrey analyzed many things at once as her mind whirled.\nMr. Hanged Man said that Qilangos was a lone wolf who doesn't trust anyone. Only he would know of his own plan. Other than my early discovery of him, there shouldn't have been anyone else who knew he would attempt the assassination tonight...\nI only told Father and Mr. Fool that I suspected that Qilangos was disguised as Baron Gramir...\nAlthough there's a telegram cable in Duke Negan's mansion and he would've been able to send out information in time to ask for help, there's no reason to hide that... Dad's puzzlement implies that the powerful being that killed Qilangos wasn't within their expectations...\nCombining all of the above, I can almost be certain that the person who killed Qilangos was Mr. Fool's adorer!\nPlus, only the unique model of the Tarot Club can create such a strange situation with unclear motives!\nQilangos was a Sequence 6 Wind-blessed, and he had the magical item-the Creeping Hunger. To be able to quickly kill him without leaving any traces behind, it could only be a High-Sequence Beyonder known also as Demigods, right? Or maybe he used a Sealed Artifact which possesses immense danger?\nRegardless of the possibility, it shows that Mr. Fool's adorer is extremely powerful...\nMr. Fool lives up to his reputation!\nRegardless, I certainly provided clues, so Mr. Hanged Man has to carry out his promise and pass me the pituitary gland of a Rainbow Salamander!\nThis should be our Tarot Club's very first mission, right?\nOne of the Seven Pirate Admirals, Qilangos, died because of us!\nLooking at his daughter who seemed excited, Count Hall, who was a handsome man in his youth, coughed lightly and warned his daughter with a mask of solemnity, \"Audrey, I know that you're very interested in mysticism, and I normally tolerate it. But you mustn't be involved in this. You can't even ask about it. You will be introduced by the Queen to the Backlund social scene events by the end of this year. As an adult, you should clearly know and remember that a terrifying Beyonder, or a powerful, hidden organization, is equivalent to danger. Do you understand that?\"\n\"Yes, Father,\" Audrey replied charmingly. \"I was just a little curious.\"\n\"Curiosity won't do either!\" Count Hall emphasized, and he couldn't help but let out a helpless smile.\n\"Okay!\" Audrey nodded obediently.\nI understand the whole incident better than you do anyway...She made a silly face in her head.\nCount Hall thought and said with a gentle smile, \"Regardless, you are the heroine tonight, the savior of Duke Negan. Half of the reason why Qilangos is dead is partially because of you, and it's the same with the bounty. Of course, if there's no one that admits to killing Qilangos and comes to receive the bounty, the remaining half of it will be yours too. Added together, it will be ten thousand pounds in total.\n\"Hmm, the bounties set up by the Intis Republic, the Feysac Empire, and other countries and organizations could be received as well. After conversion, there should be about twenty thousand pounds in total.\n\"Duke Negan promised that he would give you his holiday estate at Desi Bay as a gift. It includes a huge rubber tree plantation. I don't know the annual profit exactly, but it definitely won't be low. He spent eight thousand pounds to buy it back then and later, even built a house and purchased good quality seeds for planting.\"\nAudrey, who already had an inheritance of three hundred thousand pounds, was considered rich. However, a reward that was almost forty thousand pounds was still a huge amount of income. Many noble ladies wouldn't even receive such a figure as a dowry.\nIn an allied marriage of a noble and a businessman in August, Miss Mary Oldbury, the daughter of a millionaire, only had an eighty-thousand-pound dowry.\nI never considered the bounty...Audrey muttered inwardly.\nSuddenly, she thought of something. If she were to receive the bounty and her name spread, The Hanged Man could easily find out who Justice was.\nThis can't happen! As a member of the Tarot Club, I have to maintain a sense of mystery!Audrey looked towards her dad and reorganized her words.\n\"Dad, I'm a little worried...\"\n\"Why? What happened?\" Count Hall asked in concern.\n\"If it were to spread that I found out that Qilangos was disguised as Baron Gramir, I'm afraid that his underlings would take revenge on me. I'm afraid that whoever instructed Qilangos to assassinate Duke Negan would target me...\" Audrey tried to make herself seem pitiful, weak, and helpless.\n\"I'll hire someone to protect you,\" Count Hall replied. Then, he nodded faintly and said, \"there's really no need for you to take such a risk. Plus, the person that killed Qilangos took the Creeping Hunger. Of course, to a High-Sequence Beyonder, that wouldn't be a strong enough motive for interfering... Yes, I'll inform Duke Negan to keep this a secret and tell someone else to receive the bounty on your behalf and compensate you in private.\"\nThen, Count Hall smiled and said, \"You really are my daughter. You earned forty thousand pounds so easily. This is more than one-tenth of your current wealth.\"\nThe three hundred thousand pounds was what he had set aside for her in advance. He would still add in another part when she got married as his daughter's inheritance.\n\"Am I as good as you were?\" Audrey happily asked in reply.\nCount Hall shook his head and laughed.\n\"Much better than I was. The profit from my very first business venture was only sixty pounds.\"\nAudrey suddenly became extremely thrilled. The satisfaction derived from receiving a forty thousand pound bounty, getting her father's compliment, causing Qilangos's death, completing an extraordinary task, and the reward of a Rainbow Salamander's pituitary gland that she was going to get from The Hanged Man amplified her happiness.\nI really want to report this to Mr. Fool to get his reassurance... No, no way. A powerful, mysterious being killed Qilangos with an unknown motive. There might be someone observing me in secret, looking for clues regarding Qilangos's death. I can't show any hint of abnormality... Pui! There's nothing abnormal about me to begin with. As long as I don't attempt to recite Mr. Fool's honorary name...\nHmm, if Mr. Fool's adorer was really the murderer, He must've already known the outcome. He wouldn't need me to report it to him... Well... do I need to share the bounty with the adorer? No, no matter what kind of payment method is used to transfer twenty thousand pounds, it would definitely draw attention. I can't take the risk...\nPlus, it has always been The Hanged Man who's been asking for help from Mr. Fool. Technically, he should pay the reward. Yes, yes, after all, he declared that he had many pages of Emperor Roselle's diary!\nI'll try to gather more pages of the diary to thank Mr. Fool for answering my prayers. He definitely wouldn't be interested in crass money...\nAudrey quickly determined her next course of action\n...\nIn Duke Negan's mansion, in a secret study room.\nThe fat and tall Duke sat on a high back chair behind a desk. He was smoking a cigar as he looked at the Spellsinger of God-Ace Snake, Prime Minister Aiur Negan, and the others opposite him.\n\"Based on our current knowledge, we still aren't certain of the identity of the High-Sequence Beyonder that killed Qilangos.\" Prime Minister Aguesid Negan had just rushed over from the King's side.\nArchbishop Snake nodded.\n\"We've determined that it wasn't any of the High-Sequence Beyonders that we're familiar with or the Numinous Episcopate either.\n\"We have sufficient reason to believe that it's a powerful, mysterious Beyonder we aren't aware of. Of course, we haven't eliminated the possibility that the person was using a dangerous Sealed Artifact.\"\nDuke Negan held his cigar and said, \"Maybe it wasn't just a High-Sequence Beyonder. There might be a hidden organization behind that person, a hidden organization that we don't know enough about. Otherwise, they wouldn't be able to lay in ambush for Qilangos so accurately. Yes, perhaps one of the guests at tonight's ball is a member of theirs.\"\nHis brother, Prime Minister Aguesid stated solemnly, \"Regardless of that possibility, we have to be careful. We have to quickly find out the identity of the High-Sequence Beyonder, the purpose of his presence in Backlund, and why he killed Qilangos.\"\nA High-Sequence Beyonder that they didn't know about, who wandering in Backlund, was sufficient to draw attention from the government and three major Churches!\nAlthough a Sequence 4 or Sequence 3 Beyonder might not be able to withstand the cannon attacks of their warships, there was no need for them to experience a frontal assault. They possessed too much of a mysterious power.\nHence, they were existences even more dangerous than ironclad warships. Hence the reason why they were called \"Demigods\"!\nSpellsinger of God-Ace Snake stood up and said, \"Let me make some arrangements and get into contact with the Church of the Evernight Goddess, the Church of the God of Steam, and Machinery Hivemind.\"\n\"His Majesty will allow the military and the intelligence agencies to cooperate,\" Prime Minister Aguesid promised.\n...\nIn a hotel in the North Borough of Backlund.\nAzik sat under a gas lamp and looked at the glove before him.\nThe glove was very thin, as though it was made from human skin. It seemed that as long as it was filled with flesh and blood, it would turn into a hand.\nAzik looked at it for a very long time. His face suddenly contorted in agony and pain as he muttered, \"I seem to, seem to have cooperated with them before...\"\n...\nKlein didn't sleep well the entire night because he didn't receive any reports from Justice or The Hanged Man, nor did he receive any reply from Mr. Azik. He kept thinking about the outcome of the incident with Qilangos.\nIt must've been quite a scene if Miss Justice and Mr. Hanged Man didn't dare to contact me recklessly... But why didn't Mr. Azik reply to my letter? Did he not get involved, or was there an accident? Did Qilangos hurt him? Klein extended his hand and covered his mouth as he yawned. He got onto the trackless carriage that headed for Zouteland Street.\n\"Extra! Extra! Rear Admiral Hurricane Qilangos killed in Backlund!\n\"Extra! Extra! Rear Admiral Hurricane Qilangos killed in Backlund!\"\n...\nJust as the carriage was about to set off, Klein suddenly heard the paperboy, which was also one of the Emperor Roselle's inventions.\nKlein was momentarily stunned as he quickly fished out a penny and bought the Tingen Morning Post. Many passengers made the same choice.\nHe opened the newspaper and quickly read the headline.\nPirate Qilangos shot dead by Duke's bodyguard in Backlund.\nQilangos died? Mr. Azik did it?Klein fell into deep thought and lampooned himself,As the boss behind the scenes, I actually had to find out the outcome from the newspapers..."}
{"num_chp":468,"summary":"Emlyn's mind buzzed and he blurted out, \"It's a revelation from my  Ancestor. \u2018She' told us through a dream that the apocalypse is  approaching and that we need to make preparations. And I am key in this  matter. My mission was to pray to The Fool!\"\nHearing the undisguised and detailed response, Klein, who had  prepared his answers, was at quite a loss on where to begin. This  vampire, Emlyn White, had explained everything he wanted to know.\nA revelation from the Ancestor... Didn't the ancient goddess Lilith  perish in the Second Epoch, long before the Cataclysm, and have her  authority taken back by the Creator? It was precisely because of this  that quite a number of vampires tried to pray to the Primordial Moon,  resulting in an extremely tragic outcome... Moreover, Mr. Door had also  mentioned that the \"The Moon\" card is empty, indicating that, on the one  hand, the Primordial Moon is most likely the embodiment of some other  deity or powerful devil, while on the other hand, it indirectly proves  that the ancient goddess Lilith has lost her Sequence 0 position, which  is generally equivalent to dying...Klein instantly connected the dots.\nHe originally imagined that \"Lilith,\" who responded to the Sanguine's  prayers on particular matters, was a relic from the ancient goddess,  such as the \"Uniqueness\" of \"The Moon\" pathway. Thus, it would be rigid,  passive, and extremely restrictive, but now, its initiative of  providing a revelation had overturned his guess.\nTwo possibilities. One is that Lilith is being impersonated by  another deity who has occupied a key point ahead of time, preventing any  opponents from reaching Sequence 0 of The Moon's pathway. In essence,  the entity doesn't care about the Sanguine, and the provided revelation  is a kind of test. The greatest suspect is the Goddess who had snatched  the title of Lady of Crimson, but \"She's\" already Sequence 0,  corresponding to \"The Star\" in the Cards of Blasphemy. Why would she  covet \"The Moon?\" Is it to foil the plans of her enemy?\nThe second possibility is that the ancient goddess hasn't fully  perished. As long as no other powerhouse has become Sequence 0 in the  Moon pathway, \"She\" is able to use a unique and incomprehensible method  to continue surviving, waiting for a chance to make her return, just  like the Dark Emperor card's description. And perhaps the Goddess had  taken the title of Lady of Crimson to foil this situation to a certain  extent...\nGoing by this logic, Lilith's recent apocalyptic revelation is  \"Her\" struggle to revive after years of preparation. And The Fool plays a  key role in \"Her\" revelation. If that's true, then in a certain way,  it's an invitation for \"cooperation\"... But I'm just a Sequence 6  Beyonder, so how am I to cooperate with a yet-to-disappear ancient  goddess?\nLet Emlyn White join the Tarot Club? The Sanguine are a race with  a long lifespan. They have existed since the Second Epoch and must know  quite a number of secrets... However, that would be me taking quite a  risk. Yes, it would be possible to divine whether or not to pull Emlyn  into each gathering ahead of time...\nYes, there was a similar apocalyptic prophecy in the Sights in  the Spirit World from Yellow Light Venithan. \"He\" also pointed out that  the Abraham family's curse would be removed by an Apprentice who has the  help of a hidden existence. This matches Miss Magician's present stage.  She is an Apprentice who has received the help of me, The Fool... That's  rather interesting. Has every high-level being that's good at prophecies  realized that the apocalypse is unavoidable and have seen The Fool's  existence and his possible effects?\nOne thought after another flashed through Klein's mind, but his expression didn't change at all.\nHe leaned back in his chair and smiled leisurely.\n\"What did your Ancestor ask you to pray to me for?\"\nThe calm voice pulled Emlyn out of his stupor, and he shook his head in a slightly dazed manner.\n\"I don't know...\"\nAt this moment, Klein saw the stars behind Emlyn's chair shift quickly, turning into the symbol of the crimson moon.\nAs expected, the Beyonder pathway of the descendants of the ancient goddess, Lilith, points towards the \"Moon\"...Klein  chuckled and said, \"In a situation with the seven orthodox gods and so  many secret existences, why would your Ancestor think that I would be  the key to the apocalypse?\"\nThe Fool's attitude finally made Emlyn White calm down, realizing  that he had encountered an incredible event. He had been forcefully  pulled into a magical place by a hidden existence!\n\"He\" is The Fool...\"He\" isn't actually angry... Is it because I  represent the Ancestor? I, Emlyn White, am indeed special. I was  mentioned by the Ancestor, and I received a response from The Fool...With  this in mind, Emlyn couldn't help but sit up straighter before saying  in deliberation, \"Honorable Mr. Fool, the revelation provided by the  Ancestor is this. I, Emlyn White, will become the key in saving the  Sanguine and clinching victory against the apocalypse. And all of this  will begin from my praying to you.\"\nThe meaning behind his words was:the key to the apocalypse isn't you, but me!\nThis fellow has such a \"eighth-grader syndrome1\" side to him... That's right. He has always been very arrogant and feels self-important...Klein lampooned silently with a popular phrase from the past.\nAmused, he said, \"The same question, why me and not the seven orthodox gods or the other hidden entities?\"\n\"... I don't know.\" Emlyn shook his head honestly.\nKlein thought for a moment, then he deliberately said, \"Actually, I  think I understand your ancestor's intentions. \u2018She' wishes that, with  my help, you're able to grow into a true high-level entity and save the  Sanguine when the apocalypse happens.\"\n\"Grow?\" Emlyn said in puzzlement, \"As you know, us Sanguine have no  way of growing on our own. Only through special ceremonies will we gain  the bestowment of our elders and relics of the Ancestor that allow our  advancement.\"\nIndeed, it has to be in accordance with the Law of Beyonder  Characteristics Conservation... In other words, there have to be other  ways as long as the basic law is abided to...Klein chuckled.\n\"Your knowledge has blinded you, making you unable to see the wider world.\n\"Of course, this question will not be answered by me. The answer must  be found by you. I will only provide you with an opportunity.\"\nHe paused for a second, then he said in a condescending manner, \"Do you wish for such an opportunity?\"\nWithout any hesitation, Emlyn got up and bowed.\n\"That is what I wish for!\"\nHeh, where did your arrogance go when facing a hidden existence? Why is there only humility?Klein secretly lampooned as he tapped the edge of the mottled long table and said, \"But you have to adhere to certain matters.\"\n\"Please speak.\" Emlyn held back his excitement.\nKlein smiled and replied, \"You cannot reveal anything related to me to anyone unless you gain my permission.\n\"This includes the Sanguine who were previously present at the ritual.\"\n\"But...\" Emlyn was somewhat unable to accept the request.\nKlein asked warmly in a very certain manner, \"It's likely that Lilith didn't get you to report to anyone afterward?\"\nThis could be inferred from the fact that there was no prayer content in the revelation!\nLi...\"He\" directly called the Ancestor by \"Her\" name... It sounds like they're old friends...Emlyn's heart trembled. He lowered his head and replied, \"No.\"\nKlein said with an unperturbed smile, \"This is a secret deal, which  is why I responded after you were free from surveillance. Similarly, you  don't need to report this to Lilith as it will let certain people  notice it.\"\nSeeing Emlyn nod in understanding, Klein added, \"If you want to be  the key to saving the Sanguine, you must suffer the pain of the  corresponding thorns. For example, you will not be understood by others,  be slandered, and looked down upon. You can only silently proceed  forward in the darkness while being burdened by your heavy mission.\"\nThe words that were aimed at him made Emlyn White imagine a corresponding scenario.\nHe, who was always mocked by his kinsmen because of his fondness of  dolls, had gotten lost and entered the Harvest Church. Stained with  traces of shame, he, who had never been valued and thought highly of by  his elders, would silently guard his race from the corner, protecting  everyone without anyone knowing...\nVery soon, Emlyn, who had moved himself, respectfully replied, \"Your will will pass through the earth.\"\nKlein leaned back and said very lightly, \"I tacitly consented to the  establishment of a secret gathering, and it is held right here.\n\"Are you willing to join this gathering in search for the method to become powerful to save the Sanguine?\"\n\"I am!\" Emlyn replied without any hesitation.\nKlein nodded in satisfaction.\n\"Do you have any other requests?\"\nEmlyn was overjoyed. He said in a hurry, \"Honorable Mr. Fool, I would  like you to help me dispel the psychological cue in me. A bishop of the  Church of Earth Mother...\"\n\"I know.\" Klein calmly interrupted him.\nHe knows... As expected of a hidden existence...Emlyn's head lowered again.\nKlein let out a soft chuckle.\n\"I can help you, but what price are you willing to pay for this?\"\nAbove the gray fog, he had a very potent Spirit Vision, and he had  previously discovered that the dark-colored psychological cue within  Emlyn White's Spirit Body had at some point mostly dissipated, thinning  out to the point of frailty.\nKlein had intended to resolve the problem by referring to the ritual  used to resolve similar problems in the Book of Secrets, but the  situation now led him to believe that a secret deed ritual with the Dark  Emperor card and the purification of the Sun Brooch would thoroughly  disperse Emlyn White's psychological cue.\nPrice?Emlyn thought about it for a moment, but he couldn't think of anything that would interest a secret existence like The Fool.\nSeeing this, Klein took the initiative to say, \"I'm very interested  in some of your Sanguine history. You can use that in exchange.\"\nThe Sanguine's history?After a moment's thought, Emlyn agreed.\n\"You can think about what you would like to describe first. Heh heh.  Before that, you need to choose a code name from them.\" Klein conjured  the unselected Major Arcana tarot cards on the surface of the long  bronze table.\nEmlyn White scrutinized the cards with interest and said, \"The Moon.\n\"I choose \u2018The Moon' card!\""}
{"num_chp":1248,"summary":"In the primitive forest outside Bayam City of the Rorsted Archipelago.\nThe leaders of the Resistance gathered in a mountain cave as they looked respectfully at the Sea God's Blessed. He was wearing a black cloak, his brows were yellow, and his blue eyes were dark blue.\n\"Lord Danitz, this is an opportunity!\" a bald man in a wheelchair with a green beard, Kalat, said in excitement.\nHis partner, Edmonton, whose face was colored with short red patterns, immediately said, \"Lord Danitz, according to our intelligence officers, the situation in Bayam is chaotic. Be it the Church of the Lord of Storms or the governor-general's office, everyone is feeling anxious because of the encirclement of Backlund by the Feysac military forces.\"\nHaving said that, Edmonton looked at Kalat and got the person-in-charge of the corresponding field to give a more detailed description.\nKalat looked at the solemn-looking Lord Danitz and deliberated over his words.\n\"Internal cracks amongst them can already be seen. Some people wish to commandeer the forces of the colonies to support Backlund, while others wish to hold on to this place as the tinder for their resurgence.\n\"This difference in opinion has caused the military and the Beyonders of the Church of the Lord of Storms to be at a loss. There are flaws in every aspect.\n\"Lord Danitz, this is our chance. We can agree to the conditions of Feysac and the Feynapotter navy. We can cooperate with them to attack Bayam and take back our kingdom!\"\nIt's indeed an opportunity... But is this something I can decide? It's not like I'm stupid! Danitz listened quietly to the leaders of the Resistance and muttered to himself.\nHaving grown up in Intis, this famous pirate, treasure hunter didn't have any qualms about attacking the Loen colonies. He had zero hesitation or uncertainty about it.\nOf course, he didn't have a strong sense of belonging to the Intis Republic either. In fact, when he was occasionally a part-time pirate, he preferred targeting businessmen from Intis. This was because they often carried more valuable luxury items with them.\nThere was only one reason why Danitz didn't agree on the spot to the request of the Resistance's leaders. It was because he had become a Conspirer, so he knew very well what his position was.\nA human mouthpiece!\nA tool that was responsible for passing messages between Gehrman Sparrow and the leaders of the Resistance!\nGehrman is most likely Loenese. If I were to agree to it directly, I might not be able to see tomorrow's sun... However, he acts like he doesn't care about Loen at all... Dogsh*t! I can't be fooled by such superficial appearances! Danitz cleared his throat and surveyed the area.\n\"This matter is of grave importance. Prepare a clean and serene altar immediately. I need to pray to God.\"\nIn an organization that believed in the Sea God, such a request didn't surprise the likes of Kalat, Edmonton, and the others. It even met their expectations. Hence, they immediately arranged for people to prepare for the sacrifice.\n...\nThe Resistance in the Rorsted Archipelago can't sit still any longer... They were also supported by countries like Feysac, Intis, and Feynapotter to survive this long, or else they would've been annihilated by Loen and the three Churches... I even got them to extract quite a bit of help from the various countries... After hearing Danitz's prayers, he sighed.\nSitting in the ancient palace, he lightly tapped the edge of the mottled table in front of him. After pondering for a few seconds, he conjured The World Gehrman Sparrow.\nThe crazy adventurer immediately took on a praying posture and said in a deep voice, \"...Use the current situation to directly negotiate with the upper echelons of the Church of Storms and the governor-general's office. Exert pressure on them... The goal is to force them to give in and accept the idea of self-governance by the people of the Rorsted Archipelago...\n\"...The Resistance can guarantee that the Loenese will have most of their interests protected, allowing them to mobilize the troops and Beyonders to reinforce Backlund...\"\n...\nInside the clean and tidy altar, Danitz, who received the feedback, straightened his back.\nHe turned around and looked at the leaders waiting outside. He said with a solemn expression, \"I have received a revelation.\n\"God has informed us that every citizen of \u2018His' is precious. Unnecessary sacrifices for the sake of war should be avoided.\n\"We absolutely wouldn't want to start a war but we are not afraid of having one. In short, let's try to use the present situation to negotiate with Loen with our forces, forcing them to make a concession that will satisfy most of us. If not, we can consider war.\n\"God says to remember the hatred, but don't let it blind your rationality. The people around you and a beautiful future are the most important things.\"\nAfter becoming a Conspirer, Danitz realized that his powers of persuasion and his ability to fabricate explanations were increasing by leaps and bounds. Many a time, his thoughts would automatically take shape when he opened his mouth.\nKalat, Edmonton, and the other leaders of the Resistance all had a deep hatred for the Loen colonial masters, but the words of the Sea God and Lord Danitz had successfully wavered their resolve.\nThey had a clear understanding of how powerful the Sea King was over this period of time. If the war developed to the point where both parties were blinded with bloodlust, the Blue Mountain Island where Bayam was located might be completely submerged by the sea and become a ruin. All the locals would end up being dragged to the grave by their actions.\nThe powerhouses from Feysac and Feynapotter were indeed capable of stopping the situation from collapsing. However, how much power could they divert to this peripheral battlefield in the Rorsted Archipelago?\nAs for them, Kalat and the other leaders of the Resistance didn't trust them much. They believed that these fellows were no different from the Loenese. They were all bandits from the Northern Continent and could rip off their masks at any time to become the new colonial masters.\nAfter a moment of silence, Kalat, who was sitting in a wheelchair, looked at the man in a black cloak on the altar and said, \"Lord Danitz, we are willing to work hard for peace.\"\nHe paused for a moment before saying, \"According to the intel, the one who has the final say in the Rorsted Archipelago is Sea King Jahn Kottman. It's best if we negotiate with him directly.\"\nDanitz nodded slightly and said, \"That's exactly what I was thinking.\n\"We need to send someone to represent us and enter Bayam to face Jahn Kottman...\"\nJust as he was about to ask who was willing to go, he suddenly noticed that the gazes of Kalat, Edmonton, and the others were all on his face. It was as though they were saying that the Blessed of Sea God, the Intis pirate who had a relatively extraordinary status, was the most suitable candidate.\n...Dogsh*t! Danitz cursed silently as he looked at the crowd and quickly thought of something.\n\"Yes, this is an honor, and it also contains extreme danger. I know that some of you are filled with the spirit of sacrifice and want to make the necessary contributions. Uh, how about this, let's draw lots to decide. This is the fairest way.\"\n\"I have no objections.\" Kalat and company didn't hesitate to give an answer.\nA few minutes later, Danitz looked at the card in his hand as his facial muscles twitched.\n...\nCity of Silver, at the top of the spire, in the Chief's room.\nColin Iliad cast his gaze at Derrick Berg, who appeared less physically developed when placed in contrast to his surroundings.\n\"Are you ready?\"\nWith the leg bone-like object in his hand, Derrick held the ghostly-blue Thunder God's Roar, which was wrapped in lightning bolts, and nodded heavily.\n\"Ready and good to go.\"\nHe didn't act like a Beyonder from the Sun domain, but more like a berserk warrior.\nWith white hair and an old scar on his face, Colin Iliad immediately shifted his gaze and looked at Lovia.\n\"Are you ready?\"\nLovia, who had a head of silvery-gray hair and a pair of light gray eyes, no longer wore the usual black robe with purple stripes. Instead, she wore a set of black armor.\nShe nodded her head indiscernibly and said, \"Ready.\"\nDemon Hunter Colin, who had become a Silver Knight, cast his gaze on the others in the room and asked if they were ready.\nAfter receiving a positive response, Colin Iliad slowly walked to a wall, removed the two swords hanging on it, and carried them behind him.\n\"Let's set off.\" The City of Silver Chief gave the order in a concise manner.\nThe team that he led would once again head to the Afternoon Town camp. They would explore the Giant King's Court further, and find a path to the real sea.\nAmidst the clinking sounds of metal, Lovia, Derrick, and company silently followed behind the Chief. They walked out of the room and down the stairs in an orderly manner.\nAlong the way, they saw Waite Chirmont and the other elders of the six-member council. They saw the City of Silver residents maintaining order in the spire.\nThese people were either leaning on a railing or waiting at the staircase. Their expressions were abnormally solemn, as though they were sending off the team that was carrying hope.\nNo one spoke. The entire place was silent, but when Colin Iliad and the others passed by, the City of Silver residents raised their right arm and clenched their fists.\nAmidst the sound of this action, Colin and the other members of the expedition team left the spire and hit the road.\nThey immediately lit lanterns covered in animal hide.\nUnder the dim yellow light, residents of the City of Silver walked out of their houses and stopped by the roadside.\nThey looked at Derrick and company with admiration and anticipation. One by one, they raised their right arm and clenched their fists in front of their foreheads.\nDerrick subconsciously straightened his back, his heart burning.\nJust like that, the expedition team followed the path to the city gate under the watchful gazes of the crowd and walked out of the City of Silver.\nAs though they had a tacit understanding, Colin, Derrick, and Lovia, who had just left the protection of the city walls, turned their heads at the same time to look at their home, which had stood in the darkness for 2,584 years.\nThey saw that the residents of the City of Silver hadn't left. They were all standing near the city gates, looking at them.\nWith a swoosh, everyone raised their right arm and placed their fists in front of their foreheads.\nThis was the highest form of respect and also the deepest heartfelt blessing they could give.\nColin Iliad stared silently for a few seconds, then he closed his eyes and raised his right arm, waving it downwards.\n\"Set off!\"\nDerrick and company immediately turned around and carried the animal hide lanterns which emitted a faint yellow light. They stepped onto the dark path in silence and determination.\nDestination: Giant King's Court."}
{"num_chp":1221,"summary":"If the Dark Demonic Wolf really is preparing the Attendant of Mysteries ritual, then \"His\" whereabouts won't lack traces... Klein nodded slowly. He already had some vague ideas on his mind, but he was still unable to truly sort them out.\nHe instinctively wanted to divine the location of the \"curtain\" by using the soil that had been tainted by the \"curtain,\" so as to lock onto the location of the Dark Demonic Wolf. However, considering how the latter was an angel, such a method would most likely alarm \"Him,\" alerting \"Him\" and causing \"Him\" to take precautionary measures. Therefore, Klein rationally gave up on this idea and returned to the real world. He thought hard about formulating a plan.\nThe next day, when there was a high frequency of lightning, another batch of Moon City residents came to Gehrman Sparrow's bonfire under the leadership of a priest named Duke. They listened to his teachings, enjoyed the mushrooms, and waited to be cleansed.\nAfter the residents of Moon City experienced the cleansing, with tears streaming down their faces, Klein looked around and casually asked, \"The sun god told you to guard this land and to take note of anyone walking out of the fog?\"\nDuke, who had been cured of his bloated ailment, knew that the High Priest had mentioned this matter to the oracle before him. He answered rather calmly, \"Yes.\"\nKlein nodded slightly and continued on the topic.\n\"If you really discover someone walking out of the fog, what will you need to do?\"\nDuke said without hesitation, \"Recite the honorific name of the great sun god immediately and... report this matter to \u2018Him'...\"\nAs he spoke, his tone became very depressed. In the end, he was unable to formulate his words. This was because the sun god-the Creator-hadn't given any response for more than two thousand years. Even though Moon City had held the most complete rituals and repeatedly chanted the honorific name, there had been no response.\n\"Anything else?\" Klein pressed as he sharply noticed something.\nThis was a revelation from his spiritual intuition, and also a result of a certain degree of deduction. It was obvious that the ancient sun god and the City of Silver Creator would have considered this problem. One possibility was that the person who walked out of the grayish-white fog was extremely careful. He was very cautious and didn't enjoy being watched or monitored. After discovering the patrol team in Moon City, he would be inclined to use his Beyonder powers to affect their minds, making them forget that they had seen him or reciting the honorific name.\nIn this situation, the ancient sun god should've made certain arrangements.\nOf course, this wasn't absolute. If Amon's father could accurately predict that the person walking out of the grayish-white fog was a rookie, then there was no need to say too much in the revelation.\nHowever, considering how the ancient sun god-the City of Silver's Creator-had made an error in predicting where he would come out from the grayish-white fog, Klein was doubtful of the aforementioned possibility.\nDuke thought for a moment and hesitated before saying, \"To welcome that person and tell him a single word.\"\nKlein's spirits were immediately lifted as he asked without batting an eyelid, \"What word?\"\nDuke's lips quivered as though he was mimicking the pronunciation. Then, he said in a strange tone, \"Chernobyl.\"\n\"...\" Klein's mind froze for a second before he let out a silent sigh.\n...\nThe Loen Kingdom, East Chester County, in a forest.\nThe nearby villagers gathered here and plucked strange mushrooms that were covered in roots, deadwood, and shrubs.\nAccording to the kingdom's laws, everything that grew in this forest belonged to its owner, Miss Audrey Hall. However, with the war escalating, the demand of food, and the high taxes, these factors made it so that the farmers could no longer care about breaking the law. It was something that needed to be considered only if they survived. Furthermore, with more people participating, they naturally became emboldened.\nThey formed small teams and very efficiently plucked the mushrooms that were covered in golden stars or marbling streaks. They were divided into two parts, and a small portion was reserved for consumption. Most of them were prepared to be sold to grain merchants waiting outside the forest to exchange for gold pounds, for salt, fabric and other essential items.\nThese farmers didn't go overboard. Other than the mushrooms, they only took a portion of the fruits on the trees. They left behind what was sufficient for the rangers of the forest to submit to their masters.\nIn just two or three hours, the farmers sold large amounts of mushrooms and fruits. With the gold pounds in hand, they returned to their hamlets with beaming smiles.\nTo them, everything that happened today was what they wanted to do and they had also achieved their predetermined goals.\nThe grain merchant who had a full beard was equally happy because this was an unexpected harvest. With the present situation, he could earn a lot of money.\nHe led the workers with him to move large amounts of mushrooms and fruits to the processing point outside the city. After making the necessary arrangements, he placed them all into the warehouse.\nAs a meticulous businessman, he checked the warehouse again after sending the workers away. After confirming that there were no mistakes, he closed the door and locked it.\nAt this moment, he saw a thick wad of cash on the ground. They were all ten-pound notes.\nWhen did I drop so much money? The grain merchant bent down in joy and picked up the stack of notes.\nAs he counted, he suddenly recalled the origins of the money.\nThey were the profits from selling the mushroom powder, dried mushroom, and dried fruits!\nHow generous! The bearded businessman sighed in satisfaction and turned to leave the warehouse.\nInside the warehouse, Audrey, who was wearing a light blue dress, removed her Psychological Invisibility and took out a black pocket.\nThis was the Traveler's Bag that she had rented from Xio.\nFollowing that, the blonde, simple-looking Audrey easily threw bags of food into the black pocket.\nAfter doing all of this, she took out a hard-covered bronze notebook and flipped to a page with \"Teleportation.\"\nThis was from Fors-Leymano's Travels.\nAnd what had conspired here was secretly manipulated by Audrey.\nShe first gave the fast-growing mushrooms provided by Ma'am Hermit to the animals in the woods. With their help, she \"planted\" them at suitable spots. Following that, she \"influenced\" the farmers in the surrounding hamlets, strengthening their inner desires, and making them overcome their fear of the law. And that grain merchant \"happened\" to pass by and discovered this.\nThis sort of manipulation of a person's heart was intoxicating, like a master of all beings. However, Audrey didn't smile at all. Instead, she sighed softly.\nIt's still not enough... I'm still lacking plenty. Lots...\nThe mushrooms she had obtained wasn't the type that Little Sun said could absorb the flesh and blood of monsters to flourish. They needed sufficient nutrients to rapidly grow. Therefore, there was no way to plant a second batch of mushrooms in this forest in a short time; otherwise, it was very likely to become a desert.\nStaring at the empty cloth bags that had been emptied out, Audrey's green eyes flashed. She couldn't help but think, A large amount of food is concentrated at the Church, the royal family, the military, the government, the nobles, and the businessmen...\nThere are also some from Feysac, Intis, and Feynapotter, but who knows how many times I'll have to move them with only Traveler's Bag...\nManipulating the nobles, businessmen, and military personnel is very dangerous. I might be discovered if I'm not careful...\nIf the situation hadn't deteriorated to such a state, I might have never known that some people would have such a side to them...\nWhen the environment and circumstances are different, the masks that everyone wears are different. I have to take note of this in the future...\nAs her thoughts raced, Audrey, who lacked experience in handling such matters, decided to seek Mr. World's advice to see if he had any suggestions.\nAs The World Gehrman Sparrow had been walking alone in the uninhabited Forsaken Land of the Gods, he was surrounded by darkness and despair. Audrey suggested that he should seek her out regularly for psychological counseling. This might not necessarily imply any treatment. A casual chat could effectively relieve the pressure, loneliness, and misery.\nGehrman Sparrow followed his doctor's advice, and from their chats, Audrey knew that, apart from asking her for medical advice, this powerful adventurer would also gossip with Mr. Star above the gray fog from time to time, maintaining a rather good state of mind.\nWith this decision, Audrey immediately activated her \"Traveling\" ability and returned to Backlund.\nBut on second thought, she felt a little depressed.\nThis was because she knew that, even if she gathered a large amount of food, she could only quell the residents of Backlund for some time. If the war didn't end, the situation would still worsen.\nWar... Audrey closed her eyes. She had no idea how she could stop it.\nShe had heard from Ma'am Hermit that the nature of this war was very likely to be a battle of gods. And the prelude to a battle of gods had always been very consistent; it was to spend a certain amount of time and strength to shake the anchors of \"Their\" opponents.\nAfter some thought, Audrey pursed her lips and decided to start with what she could do.\nAs the notebook emitted a misty glow, her figure quickly turned transparent and disappeared.\n...\nBeside the quietly burning bonfire, Klein, who had just sent away the \"guests\" from Moon City, couldn't help but recall the words Blasphemer Amon had said before.\n\"He\" said that there were many clues and things in the past that \"He\" wanted to explore that were buried deep within Chernobyl.\nThe ancient sun god had also specially emphasized \"Chernobyl\"... Amidst his thoughts, he suddenly had the urge to explore Chernobyl.\nThis wasn't considered rash. It was something he had always wanted to do. However, he didn't dare to do so because of Amon.\nI've been heading east for more than half a year. Who would've thought that I would suddenly arrive at Chernobyl... Amon has obtained the last Worm of Time Beyonder characteristic and is preparing the ritual. It's impossible for \"His\" true body to still be in Chernobyl... Yes, \"He\" is a very patient King of Angels. Perhaps, \"His\" avatars have been waiting in Chernobyl all this time... After analyzing the present situation, Klein decided to let a projection from the Historical Void make an attempt.\nIn any case, he would never head there directly with his actual body!\nAfter making up his mind, Klein went above the gray fog to do a divination. Then, he returned to the real world and reached out his hand to grab into the void, dragging his past self from five minutes ago.\nAs his main body disappeared, his projection gained consciousness. Following that, he grabbed a few times and took out the black staff embedded with many gems.\nThe Staff of the Stars!\nHe wanted to use the power of the Staff of the Stars to directly \"Teleport\" to Chernobyl!"}
{"num_chp":425,"summary":"Beyond the window, the glass greenhouse reflected the pale light of the sun, and the bright roses stood out even in the thin fog.\nIn the bedroom, Duke Negan seemed to have recovered the feeling of following his father and elders around the vast lands when he was young, riding a horse, using a hound, and chasing a wild beast.\nFinally, he climaxed and the surroundings seemed to become abnormally quiet.\nAt this moment, his mind suddenly buzzed once. He felt as if the pleasure and comfort he was feeling had suddenly exploded one after another. It continued exploding without end or limit, again and again.\nDuke Negan's waist kept shaking, and his eyes were blank, his brain having lost its train of thought.\nHis heart began to beat violently in an unbearable manner, like a steam boiler whose pressure had gone beyond its limits. It could blow up at any time, and hot steam could gush out at any moment.\nIf it were an ordinary person or a Beyonder who wasn't physically strong, they would've suffered a heart attack, a massive cerebral hemorrhage, and die on the spot. But Duke Negan ultimately managed to ride through the attack. Only his eyes were unfocused, and saliva was flowing out the corner of his mouth before he weakly slumped onto his mistress.\nThe Wind-blessed and the duke's secretary, who were onguard on both sides of the room, simultaneously sensed the strange and mysterious smell of spirituality. The former's body was suddenly surrounded by a violent wind, sweeping him towards the wall, and with a clang, a large hole was blown through the wall as he stepped into the bedroom.\nThe secretary went straight to the source of the mystery-the attic of the house!\nAlong the way, he didn't evade or dodge, but the decorative vases and other objects in the corridor seemed to have found lives of their own and avoided him in ingenious ways.\nAs he ran up the stairs to the attic, the wooden floorboards seemed to rise, as if to give him a hand.\nIn just three or four seconds, the refined, handsome, blond young man entered the attic and saw a figure sitting on an old chair.\nThe figure was covered in a thick black liquid, just like the gathering of all the ugly desires and intense feelings in the depths of a human's heart. It was the greed of willing to sell and hang oneself by the ropes, the hunger that wouldn't even spare one's own kind, and a lust without limits.\nThis was a devil walking the earth!\nThe skinny secretary's expression didn't change, nor did he attack directly. Instead, he looked at the other party, reached behind him, and politely closed the door.\nBam!\nThe wooden door of the attic was closed.\nThe entire room suddenly felt like it had been completely sealed, as if one could never leave the room unless effort was put in to crack the seal.\nAt this moment, the concept of \"closing the door and sealing the room\" seemed to have been changed to \"seal this place, isolate the outside from the inside!\"\nThe Desire Apostle moved. His body expanded and grew a pair of huge bat wings that emitted light blue tongues of flames.\nOne by one, fireballs that exuded a strong sulfurous smell were formed, and they bombarded Duke Negan's blond secretary.\nThe secretary reached out with his white-gloved left hand and clenched it while half-turning his wrist.\nBoom! Boom! Boom!\nThe fireballs stopped following the principle of straight or parabolic paths as they scattered in every direction in a sudden outburst of chaos, like the irregular movement of tiny particles suggested by a\u00a0botanist1. Some of them hit the wall, some hit the ceiling, some fell beside the weak-looking secretary, and some fell backward, almost wounding the Desire Apostle himself.\nThe entire attic was a mess, with traces of destruction and char everywhere, and the house even shook a few times.\nHowever, the mysterious power that was \"sealed\" in here, or the rules that had been tampered with, had yet been destroyed. The surrounding walls, the old wooden door, and the dusty roof appeared to be on the verge of collapsing, but it remained intact.\nThe Desire Apostle wasn't frustrated by the failure of his previous attempt, nor was he flustered that he couldn't control his enemy or catalyze him into a frenzy, due to his calmness and restrained desires. His coffee-brown eyes suddenly lit up like lava as he took the form of the blond secretary. He spat out a word in the Devil language, one filled with foulness and filth: \"Die!\"\nAlmost at the same time, the pupils under the secretary's golden-rimmed glasses constricted. He opened his left fist and aimed at the Desire Apostle with the palm of his hand.\nSuddenly, his figure split into two. One was refined and skinny like his actual self. The other was a shadow covered by a black liquid of \"desire.\" The two quickly alternated, overlapping with each other at times.\n\"Die!\"\nThe words said in the Language of Foulness echoed in the attic as the secretary let out a low grunt and took two steps back.\nFollowing that, the split silhouette dissipated, and large swaths of rusted red marks appeared on his face, as though he had turned into a man of iron that had been left in a humid area for years.\nCough! Cough! Cough!He coughed violently, spitting out blobs of rusted blood that had congealed into clumps.\nThe marks on his body began to slowly peel off.\nCough! Cough! Cough!\nThe Desire Apostle was also coughing, coughing out blood that had clumped and turned to rust. The viscous black liquid covering his entire body suddenly became much thinner.\nThe Language of Foulness seemed to have half of its effects transferred to him by Duke Negan's secretary!\n...\nIn the bedroom.\nThe Wind-blessed helped Duke Negan up and kicked the beautiful mistress to the other side in case she was an accomplice of the assailant.\nThe reason why he didn't help the secretary was because he knew he had only one responsibility-to protect Duke Negan!\nAnd in similar situations, one had to be wary of more than one enemy!\nAt this point, Duke Negan had somewhat recovered a little, he was rather strong, but his limbs still felt weak. His body felt empty and his mind was sluggish. He was completely unable to use his Beyonder powers.\nHe motioned to the Wind-blessed to remove the conch necklace from his neck and brought the item to his lips.\nDuke Negan took a deep breath and blew into the small conch which was covered in strange patterns.\nSplash!\nThe low and deep sound of the tide was heard as it rushed towards the Holy Wind Cathedral.\n\"With His Grace's speed, he should be able to arrive very soon!\" The Wind-blessed first reassured him, and then with Duke Negan on his back, he went to the window and leaped down.\nHe wanted to meet up with the duke's guards outside; there were two or three Low-Sequence Beyonders among them.\nDuke Negan gasped for breath and said, \"Catch him, make sure to catch him alive, or with a Spirit Body...\n\"I want to know who it is!\"\nHe had suffered an assassination attempt from Pirate Admiral Qilangos the last time, and now, it was an unknown Sequence 5 expert. Duke Negan was very aware that he hadn't developed any irredeemable grudges with anyone recently, as such, he was especially angry and resentful.\nHe wanted to find the mastermind and use all the resources at his disposal to tear the mastermind apart!\nThe premise of all this was that he could find clues from the assassin.\nSeven or eight seconds later, most of the duke's guards surged forward, surrounding Pallas Negan and the Wind-blessed in the middle as they gathered in front of the garden.\n\"Wait here and be on guard against the enemy,\" the Wind-blessed gave the order.\nUnder normal circumstances, he had to protect the duke and evacuate from the assassination grounds as quickly as possible and rush to the safety of the Holy Wind Cathedral. However, he wasn't sure if there were any other enemies, and he was afraid of being ambushed en route. He was afraid of missing the reinforcements from Spellsinger of God, Ace Snake, and ending up being placed in a more perilous situation.\nOne second, two seconds, three seconds... Time kept flowing by as the house shook from time to time, and the battle inside seemed to have reached its climax.\n\"Why is the Archbishop not here yet?\" the panting Duke Negan asked in a slightly panicked voice.\nWith the archbishop's flying speed, he should've arrived very quickly. However, there weren't any signs of the thin fog being scattered in the direction of the Holy Wind Cathedral.\nOn high alert, the Wind-blessed hesitantly said, \"Perhaps, perhaps the Archbishop, the Archbishop...\"\nHe eventually failed to mention the possibility that the Archbishop wasn't in the Holy Wind Cathedral.\nAt that moment, the beautiful mistress of Duke Negan came to the window of the bedroom on the second floor, her eyes filled with a lost and beautiful smile.\nThen, she jumped down, deliberately hitting her head on the concrete floor.\nBam!\nAfter producing a jarring sound, there were quite a few cracks on her beautiful head, and blood began to flow out.\nShe rolled a few times, weakly, until she was facing up.\nHer eyes had lost all focus, and her frozen expression was one of madness and fear.\nSeeing this scene, many members of the duke's guards couldn't help but feel horrified.\nEven Duke Negan himself felt that his emotions were on the verge of collapse when Archbishop Snake didn't arrive.\n\"Let's go! Let's get out of here!\" he weakly called out on instinct.\nJust as the Wind-blessed was rejoicing over not being soft-hearted when kicking the mistress away-otherwise, the duke would've been killed on the spot-he heard a command filled with horror. His heart suddenly skipped a beat.\nInside the attic, the Desire Apostle, who was in the middle of a fierce battle, suddenly liquefied and turned into countless black shadows, jumping up and down on the ground.\nAfter dodging the blond secretary's attack, he rematerialized in another direction.\nThen, he looked at the enemy, raised his right arm, and slightly curled the corners of his mouth.\n\"No!\" The blond secretary's eyes reddened.\nAll of a sudden, the Desire Apostle clenched his fist.\nOutside the luxurious house, Duke Negan's horror erupted. It shot straight to his brain and into his veins, blanketing all his nerves.\nHe heard the sound of something shattering and felt a warm sensation at the back of his head.\nAt the same time, several members of the duke's guards became flustered and panicked. They all raised their custom revolvers or rifles in their hands and started shooting randomly towards the center.\nBang! Bang! Bang!\nThe Wind-blessed was the first to reach out and grab Duke Negan. He rolled to the ground, and a formless wind as sharp as knives appeared out of thin air, slicing through the throats of the guards.\nSplat. Splat.The guards clutched at their throats, slowly falling to the ground in a pool of fresh blood. Duke Negan's body twitched a few times, but then it stopped moving.\nHe was robbed of his life by his own horror.\nIf he hadn't been a Sequence 6 Beyonder, then his horror might've even dismembered him.\nOf course, if he hadn't become extremely weak, then he wouldn't have possessed such intense emotions. And even if he had these emotions, then he wouldn't have directly died as a result of this.\nBut there were no \"ifs\" in this world, Pallas Negan-the leader of the Conservative Party, the noble with the largest land apart from the king, the elder brother of the current Prime Minister, a Sequence 6 Beyonder, and a truly important figure- was dead.\nThe roses in the nearby glass greenhouse were still in full bloom.\nIn the attic, the blond secretary seemed to sense something and could no longer control his emotions.\nAs a result, his mind went blank, and he anxiously ran outside, automatically opening the door to the sealed room.\nTwo seconds later, he snapped to his senses and turned around again. However, the figure that was covered by the black liquid and the suitcase in the corner had disappeared.\n...\nThe Desire Apostle quickly left the villa, evacuating from the scene based on a predetermined route.\nIt was at this moment that a thick sea of blood seemed to appear before his eyes."}
{"num_chp":1364,"summary":"After opening the \"door\" to the Body of Heart and Mind, Klein carefully extracted the memories related to The Fool. He gathered them together and \"Grafted\" them above the gray fog.\nFollowing that, he saw the blonde-haired Audrey, who had a light white silk scarf covering her eyes, appear on the ancient stone steps. Step by step, she landed onto his mind island via the sea of collective subconscious.\nAfter some hesitation, Klein no longer allowed his consciousness to stay high in the sky. He gave up the corresponding control and allowed them to return and fuse together.\nIf he didn't do that, he would maintain absolute rationality in the subsequent treatment, making him unable to be moved by all kinds of memories and lose the possibility of strengthening his humanity.\nThis meant that Audrey's treatment was destined to fail right from the start.\nAfter arriving at the mind island that resembled a dream world using her spiritual intuition, Audrey stopped and spread her arms slightly.\nShe recalled her parents' love for her, the excitement she felt when she first became a Beyonder, and the joy she felt after helping others to change her emotions and emit corresponding fluctuations.\nThis was a method of awakening Gehrman Sparrow's memories related to his humanity. It was a Beyonder manifestation of the effects of \"empathy.\"\nScenes that were worth cherishing, or those hiding deep within, flashed across Audrey's mind one after another. Beneath her feet, from the surface of the island that represented Klein's mind, firefly-like light points seeped out of the \"soil\" and floated up.\nEvery point of light presented a different scene:\n\"A kid taking a stride forward with his short legs, receiving an ice-cream;\n\"A student secretly reading novels and comics under the cover of a textbook.\"\n\"A teenager sitting in front of his computer and playing games with full focus. Hearing the sound of a key suddenly being inserted into a keyhole, he jumped up and performed a force shutdown on his computer. Rushing back to his room, happy that his actions weren't discovered, he had a bounce in his step. Going to the living room, he asked his mother for pocket money, before appearing beside his father to casually ask questions about his studies;\n\"A young adult and his companions pushing a bashful friend to the corridor, right up to the person he had a crush on. Then, turning around, he laughed loudly;\n\"A young adult with some hint of adolescence to him stealing a glance downstairs, watching a figure leave, but unable to open his mouth no matter what;\n\"An employee with a slightly protruding belly waving his hand impatiently when he returned home for the holidays. After telling his parents not to serve him food or set up blind dates for him, he sees his parents' white hair and loses himself in thought when he calmed down;\n\"A scholarly-looking man and his brother and sister moving out. When they saw the dirt and dust on each other's faces, they laughed;\n\"...\"\nKlein sat at the round table at the veranda, one hand holding his top hat and the other hanging in midair, as though he wanted to cover his face.\nTwo transparent drops of water slowly slid past the two sides of his nose bridge and dripped into the void.\nKlein closed his eyes, his expression soft and pained.\nIn his mind island, Audrey seemed to have transformed into a whirlpool of emotions as she pulled together similar memories.\nAfter the entire island was covered in firefly-like points of light, a faint gray fog emerged.\nIn the fog, there was a door of light that was dyed bluish-black. It was formed from illusory and brilliant spherical light.\nThe main body of each spherical light was composed of transparent, ringed, or starlight-like worms and insects. They embraced each other and intertwined like mythical creatures.\nThe door of light looked a little odd at first glance, but if one looked closely, they would discover that its surroundings were dark. It was as though it was wearing a hooded black robe.\nThus, on a whole, it looked like an unknown mysterious person hiding under a robe.\nIn the next second, a slippery, illusory tentacle appeared under the deep black robe of the mysterious person.\nAt that moment, although Audrey's consciousness couldn't see or hear anything, her spiritual intuition gave her a strong sense of danger. She had a feeling that a sea consisting of corruption was about to drown her.\nNo, this isn't an illusion! She believed that if things continued to develop like this, she would get infected with a severe mental illness, or even lose control and go crazy on the spot!\nAudrey was just about to \"Placate\" herself with all her might, weakening the corruption ahead of her when the firefly-like light dots floating above the island rapidly gathered. They illuminated the grayish-white fog, diluting the darkness around the strange door of light, making the tentacles covered in mysterious patterns shrink back.\nThis was also the reason why Klein could receive psychological treatment only after barely suppressing the awakening Celestial Worthy's consciousness.\nThis made Audrey sense the weakening of the danger, and she quickly did a Psychoanalysis. Then, she immediately \"Placated\" the corruption, performing a true act of hypnosis.\nAfter repeating it over and over again, Audrey took an unknown amount of time before she finally managed to obtain the initial results she expected.\nShe then left Gehrman Sparrow's mind island and returned to her body.\nThis treatment was very difficult, so she didn't use a \"Virtual Persona\" and directly used her Body of Heart and Mind.\nAfter sensing the end of the treatment, Klein raised his hand to wipe his face, allowing The Fool's memories \"Grafted\" above the gray fog to return to his true body.\nA few seconds later, Audrey removed the white silk scarf wrapped around her eyes and nose, snapping herself out of her self-hypnosis.\nShe looked at Mr. World opposite her and muttered to herself poignantly, \"Is this the mental problem brought by godhood?\"\nHow terrifying...\nKlein nodded slightly and said, \"Yes, every angel has one. The only difference is whether it's serious or very serious.\"\n\"Saints have it too. Even Low- and Mid-Sequence Beyonders who aren't demigods will have it\ntoo.\" Audrey added with Gehrman Sparrow's former explanation.\n\"To a Low- or Mid-Sequence Beyonder, the remnant mental imprint of the former owner of the characteristic is relatively more dangerous.\" Klein picked up the gold-lined cup and took a sip. \"This is the cruel law of the mysterious world. This is because our Beyonder powers come from external objects, from the Beyonder characteristics.\"\nAudrey nodded before shaking her head gently. As she contemplated, she said, \"I don't think it's that pessimistic, just like the source of every human life comes from something else: air, bread, meat, water, etc.\n\"When we absorb them, we will also absorb their negative effects, accumulating all kinds of problems that eventually make us fall sick. However, this doesn't mean that we have to completely resist them and treat them as external objects. Once they're absorbed, there will always be some part of it that belongs to us.\n\"I didn't express it well, but I believe you should understand what I mean.\"\nKlein was taken aback for a moment before replying thoughtfully, \"A Beyonders acquisition of a Beyonder characteristic is like humans having food?\n\"Then, one should have peace of mind and not have too many repulsive thoughts; it's about resisting it, but also working alongside it; and suppressing it, but also fusing together with it?\"\n\"Roughly like that.\" After Audrey said that, she laughed self-deprecatingly. \"However, this also seems to imply a negative message: humans will eventually die, but Beyonders...\"\nShe didn't finish her sentence, unwilling to agitate the patient opposite her.\nShe switched topics and said, \"Pay a visit another two times this week. I'll be able to stabilize you under normal conditions. Yes, normal conditions.\n\"Also, you can reminisce about things when you're free, or go somewhere you yearn to go.\"\nKlein nodded and said, \"What do you have in mind about Wrath's suggestion?\"\nThe smile on Audrey's face slowly disappeared as her expression gradually turned serious.\n\"Do you have any suggestions?\"\nKlein put down his teacup and calmly said, \"Strictly speaking, the danger you bring is divided into two categories: One is when you actively or passively involve yourself in certain matters, attracting powerful enemies to your side, implicating your family, relatives, friends, and the innocent. The other is that your very existence allows some factions to target the people you value the most, doing so to threaten you.\n\"For the latter, unless you're dead, there's no way for you to ever avoid them. Of course, most of these things are a result of the former.\n\"If you give up on all your current identities in the mysticism world, and only be Mr. Fool's believer and Miss Audrey Hall from now on, no longer taking the initiative to participate in matters related to Beyonder or other matters with unpredictable elements, you can avoid most of the risks of the former and drastically reduce the latter.\n\"Under such circumstances, with the Evernight Goddess favoring the Hall family, and Mr. Fool's protection provided to you is enough to deal with the rare instances of dangers, ensuring your family's safety.\n\"That's why there's no need to split off another identity.\"\nAudrey fell silent for a while. She bit her lower lip indiscernibly and asked, \"What if I do want to split off an identity?\"\n\"As long as you let that identity believe in Mr. Fool, it's not much different from what I said just now. The only difference is that, from this point forth, you'll have to stay away from your family and friends and live with another identity.\" Klein's voice sank slightly as he said in a serious tone, \"Also, are you really fine with Hermes splitting off an identity for you?\"\nAudrey's emotions were disrupted by this question. Her eyes flickered as she said, \"However, splitting identities should be a Beyonder powers of a Sequence 3 Dreamweaver.\"\nShe definitely wouldn't be able to accomplish it by herself.\nThe corners of Klein's mouth curled up as he suddenly asked, \"You're able to use that Pride mask to enter the Garden of Eden directly?\"\nAs Audrey couldn't take the initiative to mention the Psychology Alchemists, he very directly pointed it out.\nAudrey nodded gently, surprised, puzzled, and guessed something.\n\"I'm unable to pay the equivalent price, and...\"\nWithout waiting for her to finish, Klein said with a cold expression,\n\"On the one hand, Adam has drifted from Mr. Fool and nearly killed me. On the other hand, with the apocalypse approaching, Mr. Fool has prophesied something: when the time comes, \u2018He' might fall asleep again. As \u2018His' Blessed, I won't be able to escape a similar fate. The payment you need to pay is that, when such an anomaly happens, perform certain dangerous things according to Mr. Fool's instructions and try hard to awaken \u2018Him.'\"\nWithout giving Miss Justice a chance to digest this sentence, Klein extended his right hand and grabbed a few times at the void ahead of him, pulling out a grayish-white, cold persona mask.\nUsing his status and Audrey's trust in him, he forcefully summoned the projection of the Pride mask from the Historical Void.\n\"It's connected to my mind, so no one else can use it.\" Audrey subconsciously pointed out the problem when she saw this.\n\"Give me a strand of hair,\" Klein said calmly.\nAudrey didn't think too much about it. She plucked out a strand of blonde hair and handed it to Gehrman Sparrow.\nKlein took the strand of hair and wrapped it in the eye holes in the persona mask.\nThen, he held his silk hat in one hand and the grayish-white mask in the other as he slowly stood up.\nDuring this process, he mobilized Sefirah Castle and \"Deceived\" the rules.\nPa!\nKlein wore the Pride mask without facing any resistance. Immediately, he saw human-clothed animals walking upright.\nHe had entered the Garden of Eden directly.\nLooking at the black cathedral in the middle of the city, Klein curled his lips and took out the Staff of the Stars and wore the silk top hat over his head."}
{"num_chp":1067,"summary":"This...The Second Epoch's subsidiary gods truly are hidden powers. There was Dragon of Wisdom, Herabergen\uff0cand there's God of the Dead, Salinger. They were all powerful figures that even reached the throne of Sequence 0. Of course, I can't be sure about the Dragon of Wisdom. It's just quite possible...\nYes, and there's the God of Dawn, Badheil, and the Goddess of Harvest, Omebella. I can't rule out the possibility that \"They\" have lived quite well all the way to the Fifth Epoch... I wonder if the God of Spiritual Creatures Tolzna and the Goddess of Misfortune Amanises managed to evade the authority retrieval operation by the City of Silver Creator at the end of the Second Epoch. If \"They\" managed to escape that fate, what roles did \"They\" play in the Third and Fourth Epoch? After a moment of shock, Klein began thinking poignantly.\nThinking back to the betrayal of the Kings of Angels in the Third Epoch, he couldn't help but lampoon:\nYou have to be careful of fire, theft, and subsidiary gods!\nAt that moment, Audrey, who didn't know much about the subsidiary gods' true names or authorities, didn't show any perturbations in her emotions. She acted as different female elves in Siatas's memories, and she constantly talked to her about her experiences and things she knew about the Second Epoch.\nAccording to Siatas, in the history of the elves, there was no concept of the First Epoch or Second Epoch. In the beginning years that were unknown to her, it was chaotic, dark, and crazy, and it didn't leave behind any texts. After the supernatural races obtained a certain level of intelligence and had their own languages, creatures finally had some knowledge of history.\nIn that era, ancient gods appeared one after another. The sky, the land, the sea, and the underground world slowly changed from disorderliness to orderliness. However, other than the tyrannical and crazy ancient gods, no one knew how many years this stage lasted. She just knew that, very, very long ago, it was referred to by the major supernatural races as the \"Sprouting Era.\"\nAfter the \"Sprouting Era\" was the \"Early Era of Fire\" in which the eight ancient gods fought against each other in different camps. This was also a long time before Siatas's birth, so she could only understand this from the elven historical records that it was a time when quasi-humans fought non-humans, resisting the corruption and intrusion from the devils and demonic wolves. Amongst them, the humanoids were the giants, elves, Sanguine, as well as their slaves.\nThe \"Early Era of Fire\" lasted different periods of time according to the different records. However, a common point was that it lasted less than a thousand years, as the essence of the ancient gods was madness, tyranny, cruel, and cold. They were often driven by their instinct.\nAfter the Sanguine Ancestor Lilith, Mutant King Kvastir, and Annihilation Demonic Wolf Flegrea perished during the betrayal, the \"E3rly Elm of Fire\" ended, and the war broke out \"The world was damaged, and it didiVt stop for centuries.\nDue to the fact that the giants and dragons were relatively strong in this period of time, they were known as the \"Dual Era.\"\nBy the time the five races formed a new balance of powers, the Northern Continent, the Southern Continent, the East Continent, and the Five Seas had recovered some level of peace. This was when Siatas was born and had grown up in until she entered Groselle's Travels.\nIn the history that she described, there were two important points. First of all, it proved the existence of the East Continent, a place where the Giant King's Court was. Second, after the \"Sprouting Era,\" the supernatural races had their own kind of civilization. They weren't completely irrational as their descendants believed them to be. Of course, the inclination towards tyranny, cruelty, coldness, and slaughtering still existed, as though they were all in a half-state of losing control. It was only after the \"Dual Era\" that the new generation of elves and giants gained some level of rationality. They had feelings just like Siatas and Groselle.\nThe East Continent seems to be the Forsaken Land of the Gods... It was abandoned during the Cataclysm? Similar thoughts surfaced in Klein's, Leonard's, and Audrey's minds.\nThey were very interested in this, but it was a pity that Siatas had always lived in the Elf King's court. Their occasional forays outside were limited to parades at sea. She had never been to the East Continent, and she lacked the required knowledge.\nUnder Audrey's influence, Siatas's dream began to show the traditions and language of the elves.\nAccording to the legends that the Queen's attendant had heard of, Elvish was created by the king in the \"Sprouting Era.\" Every word was produced with the birth of a first-generation elf. The number of Elvish words meant the number of first-generation elves.\nHowever, the traditions of the elves weren't too unified. They relied heavily on their surroundings-the elves in the forests and the sea were undoubtedly different in all kinds of customs.\nWhat they shared in common was that they believed in the king, who was an ancient god, and \"His\" queen. They liked to make food with the blood of their prey. Many of them had culinary methods such as roasting. Even sea elves often came up to the reefs for a bonfire party. They were close to nature and were good at using all kinds of spices. They idolized the strong, and they were proud of being quick to act before thinking...\nWith myths and reality mixed together, it's hard to tell what's real and what's fake... Their traditions have destroyed my previous theories... Klein listened with a stoic expression as he quickly analyzed every word Siatas said.\nAfter figuring out the relevant matters, Audrey circled around the keyword of the West Continent and made Siatas's dream change. It reflected some of her subconscious memories.\nThe coral palace appeared before Klein and company again. Siatas followed behind Queen of Calamity Cohinem and walked to a crystal window.\nShe glanced at the Queen's exquisite and complicated dress, and she stole a glance at the \"deity\" who controlled calamities. She asked curiously, \"Your Highness, are you looking west?\"\nTo the elves, as long as they didn't feel the pressure of violence, they would ask questions on the spot.\n\"Why do you think so?\" Cohinem didn't turn back as \"She\" asked with an indifferent expression.\n\"I just learned of a legend that our elves originated from the Western Continent,\" Siatas replied. \"Your Highness, does the Western Continent really exist? Is that really where the first-generation elves were born?\"\nCohinem's lips curled slightly as she said with a slightly ethereal voice, \"The Western Continent may exist, but it may not exist either. Every race needs to give themselves an illustrious origin, a home for the mind.\n\"Siatas, where is your home to you?\"\n\"My home?\" Siatas repeated the question as she replied blankly, \"It's where His Majesty and Your Highness are. It's this palace that can lead to the forest where my parents live...\"\nAs she said this, Siatas's emotions gradually turned heavy, lost, and melancholic.\nIt was obvious that she was influenced by her subconscious's corresponding memories.\nShe had entered Groselle's Travels and had been away from home for two to three thousand years.\n\"Therefore, to elves like you, the Western Continent doesn't exist, but to some elves, it definitely exists.\" Queen of Calamity Cohinem calmly gave her final answer.\nSiatas didn't ask further, because she suddenly remembered that the Queen wasn't a first-generation elf.\nSuch a response made Klein increasingly confused and puzzled. Thankfully, from the Second Epoch to the Fifth Epoch, the Western Continent had zero presence, so it didn't have any important secrets related to him. He was just trying to find out more about it and hadn't held out much hope.\nAfter ending the guiding of Siatas's subconscious and since it was almost noon, without any other nearby dreams that they could leap into, Audrey left with Klein and Leonard, and they appeared in Mobet and Siatas's bedroom.\nLooking at the Fourth Epoch viscount whose body had been tightly bound by the elf, Audrey's expression suddenly turned gentle as she said with a laugh, \"They seem to be doing pretty well...\"\n\"No, no, no, it's terrifying to have such a violent, direct, and imaginative wife who dares to take action! Only a person like Mobet would like and enjoy being with her...\" Leonard, who didn't have a poet's talent but had the liberal inclinations of a poet, shook his head as he kept his hands in his pockets.\nAt this point, he muttered in thought, On the contrary, it's true that an experienced thief needs a woman like Siatas to rein him in. Hmm... I wonder what kind of members of the opposite sex Old Man's other family members like...\n\"Sigh, they don't need our envy or objections. This is how they live together. Emperor Roselle once wrote a poem, saying \u2018for my love I'll sacrifice my life[l]'...\"\nAs Klein listened to their discussion, he opened his mouth and closed it again. He didn't tell them that Siatas and Mobet had actually died. It was only when they died that they truly felt their love for one another. The ones living in the book were just copies created by the book world.\nAfter leaving the couple's house, the trio headed to Groselle's blacksmith shop.\nAlong the way, when they went past a street, Klein saw Frunziar, who was known as a philosopher, and Audrey recognized him to be Loenese a glance.\n\"Is that the soldier from a hundred years ago?\" Audrey slowed down her pace and asked.\nKlein recalled Frunziar's longing for his hometown, and the ashes he had placed in Backlund's cemetery. He fell silent for two seconds before nodding gently.\n\"Yes.\"\nMr. World is feeling a little emotional... He's like a calm river on the surface, with a lot of undercurrents and eddies underneath... Audrey nodded indiscernibly and asked, \"Can we enter his dream? I want to get the Judge and Disciplinary Paladin's potion formula.\"\n\"No problem,\" Klein replied as he glanced at Leonard.\nLeonard continued having his hands in his pockets, but his eyes instantly darkened.\nSitting on the bench, Frunziar fell asleep.\nRight on the heels of that, three people appeared in his dream.\nThis was a bustling city with buildings made from wood. The pedestrians who came and went were mostly Loenese.\nThe black-haired, blue-eyed Frunziar stood outside a house as he looked in without daring to approach. Only when a woman wearing an old long dress came out from inside did he excitedly go forward and attempt to hug her.\nHis hug went through the woman without them making contact at all.\nFrunziar stood rooted to the ground as he blankly shouted, \"Mother...\"\nAudrey, who wanted to guide the dream, quietly watched this scene. Then, she looked around and discovered the iconic clock.\n\"Backlund...\" Audrey pursed her lips and turned her head. She looked at Klein and asked, \"Can't they leave the book world?\"\n\"It's been too long. If they leave, they will grow old, die, or even be reduced to dust.\" Klein's voice was like a serene river. \"I delivered one of Frunziar's items to Backlund.\"\nThis... As a Spectator, Audrey acutely sensed the cruel reality behind those words. She couldn't help but raise her head and look out of the dream, looking at the location where Mobet and Siatas were.\nLeonard wanted to ask what it was, but after looking around, he maintained his silence.\nFollowing that, Audrey seriously guided his dream. Outside of obtaining two potion formulas, she made Frunziar return home and live happily with his parents, brothers, and sisters.\nIt was a beautiful dream.\nAfter leaving Frunziar, Klein, Leonard, and Audrey quickly saw Groselle's home.\nThis was the last stop of their exploration. After obtaining information from Groselle's subconscious, they would enter the book world's sea of collective subconscious and seek out the secrets that might exist in this book.\n[1] Adapted from a Hungarian poet, Sandor Petofi's Liberty and Love."}
{"num_chp":1092,"summary":"Bernadette was wearing an Intis-styled blouse and was sitting there quietly. Her chestnut-colored hair was naturally draped over her shoulders, and her straight brows were spread out perfectly. She actually had the aura of a female professional from Earth, one that had been in a high position for a long period of time.\nThe Emperor's sense of aesthetics still has quite the influence over Queen Mystic. However, it's limited by the environment around her, and it cannot be fully manifested... Klein took off his hat and pressed it to his chest. He bowed slightly before casually pulling out a chair and sitting down.\nWith a sweep of her blue eyes that resembled the deep-blue sea, Bernadette's gentle and calm voice rang out:\n\"Why did you contact me so urgently this time?\"\nAren't you a Clairvoyant? Didn't you receive a hint of a revelation? Klein subconsciously replied in his mind before he felt that he was being too arrogant.\nThis should be the aftereffects of interacting with the Red Angel evil spirit for too long... With \"His\" level, it would naturally affect the people around \"Him.\" If \"He\" was willing, this effect would definitely turn into a form of corruption... Klein quickly did a self-analysis and made a judgment.\nHe pondered for a moment before asking, \"Have you attained what you wanted to achieve in Backlund?\"\nBernadette slowly shook her head.\n\"No.\nYou can even say that I failed.\"\n\"Oh?\" Klein used a tone to express his surprise and puzzlement.\nBernadette glanced at him and said unhurriedly, \"There's a strange name for the Sequence 2 potion of the Mystery Pryer pathway. It's called \u2018the Sage.' To advance to this level, one has to prevent a disaster that involves a higher level of power.\"\nSage... So that's where \"sage\" of the Hidden Sage comes from... Klein was momentarily enlightened. Just as he was about to ask, he heard Queen Mystic continue, \"I anticipated such an opportunity in Backlund, so I came here a few years in advance to make preparations. I've recently been waiting for it for a long time.\n\"Unfortunately, I predicted that it would happen in the second half of this year. Last year, I wasn't in Backlund at the end of the year, so I wasn't able to stop the Great Smog. And in this war, I tried my best to do something, and I achieved something. But to my surprise, Feysac directly attacked Backlund with an air raid, and the disaster ultimately erupted.\"\nThat's why you said you failed... Klein nodded indiscernibly and said with a sigh, \"I didn't expect the ones to start the war to be the Feysacians either.\"\nAs he spoke, he sighed inwardly. The difficulty of Queen Mystic's advancement ritual was controversial. It all depended on one's luck.\nOne had to know that before he became a demigod, Klein had already stopped the True Creator from descending. He had saved Tingen and Backlund, which were feats that could definitely satisfy the ritual requirements of becoming a Sage. But under normal circumstances, there weren't as many disasters like these, and they weren't things that could easily be stopped.\nJust like the present situation, Amon's brother had planned for one to two thousand years. Even if something went awry with King George III, war would erupt as \"He\" had expected. This was because the root cause of the Uniqueness of the Death pathway hadn't been resolved.\nThis made him suspect that Mr. Azik's life in the Northern Continent had always been under the arrangement of Amon's brother. If not, how did \"He,\" who had lost his memories, escape from the sights of the various major Churches without a shape-shifting mask?\nMore importantly, it was unknown why Azik had used his real name in this life!\nAnd this wasn't something that was suspected by anyone, nor did it incur any investigations!\nIs this all part of your plan? Amon's brother... Upon thinking of this, Klein felt a certain trauma, a result of post- traumatic stress disorder. His body nearly trembled.\nHe silently took a deep breath and looked at Queen Mystic and added, \"This war involves the son of the Creator, King of Angels, and the true deities. It's not something you can stop.\"\nWith Bernadette's knowledge and experience, she still had some changes to her facial expression when she heard the sentence. She repeated a few keywords in a low voice:\n\"The son of the Creator... King of Angels... Deities...\"\nShe wasn't too surprised by this, as if she had already made a prediction. However, even if she was a Clairvoyant, she wasn't able to pry into the \"script\" composed by Amon's brother.\nAfter repeating it again, Bernadette fell silent for two to three seconds before sighing to herself, \"So that's the reason...\" Klein adjusted his posture and thought.\n\"Actually, to you, this war is also an opportunity.\n\"Next, there will be many disasters, including the clashing of powers at the angel level. I believe that you should at least be in control of a Grade 0 Sealed Artifact. You can stop certain matters from happening at the critical moment. Of course, you have to choose a good time and method.\"\nBernadette nodded gently and agreed with what he said. She also tacitly acknowledged that she possessed at least one Grade 0 Sealed Artifact.\nOf course, as the daughter of the protagonist of the previous era, as the child Emperor Roselle doted on the most, it would be unbelievable if her father didn't leave her one or two Grade 0 Sealed Artifacts.\nWhat was more important was that Bernadette was already preparing the ritual needed to advance to Sage. This meant that she definitely had the corresponding Sequence 2 Beyonder characteristic in her hands. To a certain extent, it was equivalent to a Grade 0 Sealed Artifact.\nAfter tacitly agreeing, Queen Mystic Bernadette's gentle but emotionless voice changed slightly.\n\"However, I still don't like war, even though it will give me a chance.\n\"I once hated him and couldn't understand him. That's why I didn't call him father for many years. It's because he did too many things against the trend of the times and hurt the innocent. I couldn't accept my heroic father turning into a crazy tyrant...\n\"And now, through the answers from the entity behind you and my own investigations, I somewhat understand his situation. I understand that he was suffering from despair, pain, and loneliness. I understand him as a drowning person, only struggling on instinct.\"\nWhen Klein heard that, he sighed and felt his emotions in turmoil.\nIn this world, the only people who understood Huang Tao-Roselle Gustav-the most were probably the two people sitting here.\nOf course, this feeling didn't stop him from sensing that Queen Mystic Bernadette's condition was a little different today. In the past few times they had met, this king's daughter had never said so much, nor had she opened her heart so directly. At most, she would play the tune of music, subtly expressing her sadness.\nAfter some thought, Klein pretended not to notice, and he asked, \"When did \u2018He' start changing? Do you think there was any prior warning, or something worth paying attention to?\"\nQueen Mystic Bernadette's deep blue eyes moved slightly, as though she had sunken into her trove of memories.\nAfter a while, she slowly said, \"Not long ago, he proudly said to me, \u2018Haven't you always wanted to know what's surrounding our moon and other planets? In the future, our journey might be towards the sea of stars.\"1\nThe sea of stars... What's on the moon and other planets... As Klein pondered over Queen Mystic's words, he suddenly recalled a key phrase and something.\nThe keyword was:\nCosmos!\nThat matter was:\nMr. Door had once told Emperor Roselle that once he had the ability, he could take a look at the moon. That would resolve many of his doubts.\nThe emperor finally went? That hysterical diary page[l] was written after this exploration attempt? He had unknowingly changed his personality, becoming extreme? Klein recalled the corresponding content. Under Queen Mystic Bernadette's gaze, he deliberated and said, \"At your level, you should more or less know that there's corruption coming from the cosmos.\"\nBernadette nodded and didn't pursue the matter. It was as though she knew that Gehrman Sparrow wasn't sure either. She knew that only an angel-level demigod could detect and resist the corruption.\nAfter more than ten seconds of silence, the topic was directed towards Klein's reason for being here.\n\"One of the reasons for this war is because the Loen King, George III, discovered the nine secret mausoleums left behind by the Blood Emperor, doing so with the intention of switching to the Black Emperor pathway and becoming a Sequence 0. As such, he abolished the Grain Act...\"\nKlein didn't care if Queen Mystic knew anything about these matters. He followed his own pace and roughly told her everything without missing out any key matters. Finally, he said, \"The Black Emperor does have the ability to revive, but once a new Black Emperor appears, the original entity would perish completely.\"\nThe original entity here referred to Emperor Roselle, who might've succeeded before being \"assassinated.\"\nSometimes, Klein even suspected that Roselle had intentionally given others a chance which resulted in him perishing on the spot. This way, when he revived from the astral world and regained his Uniqueness and absorbed the three Sequence 1 characteristics, he would no longer absorb the characteristics of Knowledge Emperor, Arcane Scholar, and the characteristics of another pathway. He could make himself pure; thus, free from madness.\nThis was a way to live through death, but the prerequisite was that Roselle's ritual had succeeded. He had died during or after the ritual, and not before the ritual.\nQueen Mystic Bernadette took it all in before slowly saying, \"You want to stop George III?\"\n\"Yes.\" Klein nodded frankly.\n\"Why?\" Bernadette pressed in an unperturbed tone.\nThe corners of Klein's mouth curled up as he smiled.\n\"Some ridiculous reasons that aren't worth mentioning.\"\nBernadette's gaze landed on his face for a moment before she said, \"That's enough. I'm also doing such things for something that has slim chances, one that's almost impossible to happen.\n\"We can cooperate on stopping George III.\"\nWe're all \"ridiculous\" people... Klein sighed and said, \"I'll give you the method to summon my messenger.\" \"Alright.\" Bernadette reached out her right hand and lightly tapped the table.\nThe fountain pen that was originally placed diagonally in front of her suddenly jumped up, as if it was held by an invisible elf before writing fluidly on the paper.\n\"This is the method needed for summoning my messenger,\" said Bernadette calmly.\n[1] Author's Note: From Chapter 715"}
{"num_chp":1005,"summary":"Wearing a monocle, Amon, who wore the appearance of Enuni, didn't seem like an infiltrator or assailant. Instead, \"He\" appeared like a visitor as \"He\" eagerly mentioned all the preparations \"He\" had done, as well as Arrodes's origins.\n\"He\" paused before \"He\" could finish \"His\" sentence. Dwayne Dantes opposite \"Him\" had turned into a dirty gray rat.\nThe rat raised its right claw, pressing at its eye.\nAt the same time, in the garden of 160 Boklund Street, with his thin and cut, black-haired, brown-eyed face, Gehrman Sparrow appeared in the middle of a bunch of roses.\nBack when Amon was saying something highly enticing, \"He\" had secretly split off a Worm of Time in an attempt to invade Klein's body in order to Parasitize him. However, Klein had been on high alert the entire time. He detected this attempt via the changes in his Spirit Body Threads, so he rapidly created a marionette at the critical moment and swapped locations!\nSilently, Amon, who looked like a mixed-blood youth, appeared in front of Klein.\nBehind \"Him,\" a twelve-ringed transparent worm fell from the third story and returned to \"His\" body.\nAnd at that instant, the earthworms in the garden's soil, the insects in the woods, the rats in the shadows all crawled out, either swarming towards Gehrman Sparrow and Amon or were fleeing from this region.\nThe main reason why Klein had patiently listened to Amon was to use that time to create marionettes!\nTo a Bizarro Sorcerer, they were only complete with their marionettes!\nAmon still wasn't in a rush to take action. \"He\" pinched the monocle embedded deep in \"His\" eye socket and looked around, saying with a smile, \"Your actions often expose your problems. To a master of deceit, everything that you did was enough for me to detect your weakness.\n\"In such a tense and dangerous situation, you actually chose to convert rats, insects, birds, and earthworms into being your marionettes without considering your servants. What does this tell me? It says that you have outstanding moral standards. You still view yourself as human and are unwilling to harm them.\n\"Upon grasping this point, even if my avatar is inferior to you, it's still easy to break you down. You wouldn't even be capable of dying even if you wish for it.\n\"Ah, right. You can stop your attempts at secretly controlling my Spirit Body Threads. This is because you're controlling the Spirit Body Threads I stole. They belong to your butler, your maid, and your coachman. If this continues, I'm afraid you will feel a deep sense of guilt.\"\nEven Spirit Body Threads can be stolen? No, it's more like grafting... Klein's expression froze slightly as he terminated his control of Amon's Spirit Body Threads.\nHe had been patient, allowing Amon to drone on with his drivel, mainly doing so because he was secretly trying to turn Amon's avatar into his marionette.\nTo a Bizarro Sorcerer, battles like this, where he stalled for time and exerted his influence in secret, should've been something he was best at and something he enjoyed the most. Unfortunately, he had encountered Blasphemer Amon, the current pinnacle existence of the Marauder pathway. Even if he was only facing an avatar, he could do nothing about \"Him.\"\nKlein actually suspected that Amon's words were a ruse, but he wasn't able to see through it. He didn't dare take the risk.\nDuring such times, he needed the help of a Spectator!\n\"For you to say so much, I doubt it's solely to think of the means to Parasitize me, right? You should know that, before severely injuring me, it's very difficult to Parasitize a Bizarro Sorcerer who can see Spirit Body Threads,\" Klein calmly said as he wore Gehrman Sparrow's face.\nAmon immediately chortled.\n\"You've finally noticed it.\"\n\"You're trying to steal my destiny?\" Klein swapped locations with a marionette once again, constantly making his actual body appear in different corners of the garden.\n\"No.\" Amon shook \"His\" head, keeping \"His\" hands in \"His\" pockets while leisurely saying with a smile, \"If a magic mirror like Arrodes is willing to listen to your instructions and deliberately ingratiate itself towards you, it means that you aren't as simple as I imagined. I'm not a Beyonder of the Tyrant pathway, so I wouldn't be so rash as to directly steal your destiny. Heh heh, I suddenly have a feeling that directly replacing you would result in something I don't wish to see happening.\"\n\"How did you know Arrodes is ingratiating itself? Flora Jacob's destiny shouldn't have something like that.\" Klein appeared on a tree.\nHis different marionettes continued changing their locations.\nAmon pulled out one hand and pinched \"His\" chin and said, \"Didn't I say why? I spent time to gather information and seek out the source. Oh, I went to the Church of Steam and had a chat with Arrodes. It wasn't too frank, and it was willing to be tortured by me rather than reveal your true origins. Unfortunately, that was inside the Church of Steam; otherwise, I would've directly Parasitized it and learn of everything.\"\nEven living Sealed Artifacts can be Parasitized? If Arrodes strictly abided by the rules, based on its answers in the past, \"He\" isn't too sure of my actual situation and only has certain guesses... Klein's eyes widened. Just as he was about to say something, he heard Amon laugh and say, \"You really don't seem to be in a rush. What are you waiting for?\n\"Do you not know that my pathway's Sequence 2's name is Trojan Horse of Destiny? Although I'm only an ordinary avatar, I do have some powers that I can use, such as tinkering with your destiny, making certain errors appear for a certain period of time. For instance, no one will notice it no matter how much you cry for help.\n\"Heh heh, that also means that, even if you were to trigger the Evernight Emblem in your hand, you will only be able to get the effects of Concealment, and you will not be able to transmit your intentions of seeking help, regardless of your prior agreements. Also, even if you were to shout for help or create an explosion, the pedestrians and servants in the room wouldn't be able to hear a thing.\n\"This is the reason why I was talking so much. For an ordinary avatar, certain matters take time.\n\"Alright, it's your turn to answer my question.\"\nKlein didn't answer as he kept switching positions with his marionettes. However, Amon kept appearing in front of him as they continued their \"conversation.\"\nAt this moment, he made one of his marionettes ask, \"Since you've already completed the controlling of destiny, why aren't you taking action?\nYou also seem to be waiting...\"\nBefore this Gehrman Sparrow who was a thin \"paper figurine\" could finish his sentence, there was a strong gust of wind from afar.\nLeonard, in a black trench coat and a black silver-inlaid cane in hand, flew to Boklund Street!\nKlein, who had appeared to Amon's side, immediately said, \"This is what I've been waiting for!\"\nAs he said that, he triggered the Evernight Emblem that he had been clasping tightly.\nSimultaneously, he snapped his left hand's fingers, igniting the tallest tree in the garden, making its scarlet flames soar into the sky.\nAnd this huge, obvious bonfire, that would've been noticeable at a glance from across the street, was noticed by no one, be it the maids wiping the windows on the first story or the pedestrians strolling beneath the Intis parasol trees. Even in midair, Leonard Mitchell ignored this scene, rushing for 39 Boklund Street at high speeds.\nAnd at this moment, Pallez Zoroast's slightly-aged voice sounded in this Red Gloves's mind:\n\"Turn back. Head to Unit 160.'\nAlthough Leonard was puzzled, his experienced self didn't ask why when it came to supernatural matters. He immediately swung the direction Word of the Sea pointed and changed directions.\nIn the garden of 160 Boklund Street, Amon raised \"His\" head as \"He\" pressed the crystal monocle on \"His\" right hand, chuckling.\n\"This is also what I've been waiting for.\"\n\"He\" ignored Gehrman Sparrow as his smile grew obvious. He continued speaking in irresistible delight, \"To be able to discover the abnormalities of fate in this region...\n\"It's \u2018Him\uff1b Pallez!\"\nAs \"He\" spoke, this Blasphemer changed \"His\" actions and adjusted \"His\" monocle.\nAt this moment, a strange gloom fell over the entire street. It was as though the entire place had been separated from reality, turning into a secret.\nIn the activity room of 39 Boklund Street, Hazel looked out the window and muttered in puzzlement, \"Is it about to rain?\"\nThis wasn't anything important, so she retracted her gaze and reached out her hand onto the three-layered tray for high tea.\nThen, she saw her father, Member of Parliament Macht, strangely open his right palm.\nGlimmers of light condensed out of thin air, forming into a crystal monocle in his palm.\nMacht then wore this monocle on his right eye.\nThis... Hazel had already sensed something amiss as she frantically looked at the others in the room.\nHer mother, Ma'am Riana, took off the accessory on her nose and wore a monocle that she had taken out of somewhere. The servants standing beside her all took out a similar monocle and wore it on their right eye.\nThud!\nHazel stood up instinctively as she retreated repeatedly, toppling the chair over in the process.\nThis sound alarmed everyone in the room. Macht, Riana, and the servants turned their heads to look at Hazel.\nBit by bit, a smile suffused the comers of their lips.\n\"Ah!\"\nHazel broke down as she let out a shrill scream.\nThis scream passed through the house and through the garden, drawing the attention of the pedestrians on the streets. At this point, Amon had already lowered \"His\" right hand from his monocle. Looking at the figure in midair,\n\"He\" said with a smile, \"Pallez, it's already 1350 of the Fifth Epoch. The technique of relying on the gathering of avatars to raise one's level is already outdated.\"\nBehind \"Him,\" Klein didn't waste any time as he reached into his pocket as though he was drawing a gun while he made Creeping Hunger turn transparent. A transparent book condensed in front of him.\nHowever, Amon simply raised his hand and the glove vanished.\nHowever, along with the human-skinned glove's disappearance, Gehrman Sparrow also did.\nPa!\nLanding in Amon's palm wasn't a glove but a rat, a rat that had died after becoming a marionette.\nOn the other side of Amon, Klein, who wasn't wearing a hat but was wearing a shirt and vest, appeared. He then threw out the item he had previously taken out, and he threw it at his target.\nIt was a paper crane."}
{"num_chp":531,"summary":"He has some things to ask Captain?\nDanitz frowned as he watched Gehrman Sparrow leave the room, unsure what his real motive was.\nWhat is this fellow really after? Money, riches? But he had the time to take away the heads of Steel Maveti and Blood Brambles Hendry to exchange for nearly 10,000 pounds in bounty rewards. Yes, even after paying any commissions, it would still be seven to eight thousand pounds. Yet, he didn't do so. Moreover, he generously shared the spoils of war with me. This is very contradictory. When he first heard that I was Blazing, his first reaction was to call me a 3,000 pound bounty... In Captain's words, this isn't scientific...\nWhy would he deliberately give up the bounty? Unless... Unless he has a better way to claim it safely, or he had specially left it for someone? Yes... He had been prepared for the appearance of the Mandated Punishers... H-he has his own connections and information channels! This way, everything can be explained!\nThere's also the possible existence of the demigod that killed Qilangos. Hmm, there's a powerful and secretive organization behind Gehrman Sparrow!\nShocked by his own conjecture, Danitz instinctively tried to use his body language to express his feelings, but he forgot that his left arm was still fractured. He immediately grimaced in pain.\nThis made him feel even more terrified. He didn't want his captain to meet such a dangerous and crazy fellow.\nHe even suspected that Gehrman Sparrow's real motive was his captain's 26,000 pound bounty!\nIn a duel, that lunatic might not necessarily win against Captain, and there's still the first mate, second mate, third mate, and a few boatswains. But he has a terrifying organization backing him! You want to hurt Captain? Over my dead body!Danitz puffed out his chest, raised his neck, and was filled with a stirring sense of self-sacrifice.\nHe ran a hand through his hair, gave a long grunt, and said to himself, \"I'll make further observations. Perhaps Gehrman Sparrow really only has questions that he wants answered.\"\nSubconsciously, he looked around and found both the Flying Carpet and the Shadow Cloak. They weren't missing.\nIn other words, Gehrman Sparrow left the things that belong to me behind. Isn't he afraid that I'll take the opportunity to escape? Or did he steal my hair that makes it easy for divination?\nNo, no, he's a crazy guy. Even if he wishes to use my hair, he would just walk over and extend his hand to pull one out. It's impossible for him to do it secretly... Right, there's a powerful and secretive organization behind him! Perhaps, at this moment, there are people from that organization secretly monitoring me. They're waiting for me to leave, waiting for me to seek out Captain... How insidious!\nGehrman Sparrow must've gone out on purpose!Danitz felt that he had grasped the truth of the matter thanks to his experience and wisdom.\nHe paced back and forth before sitting back in the reclining chair. He then thought with a silent, mocking smile.\nI'm not leaving!\nI want to see what you can do!\nI will not bring danger to Captain!\n...\nA quarter past three in the afternoon, Symeem Island.\nThis island was also a part of the Rorsted Archipelago, but it was the furthest from the City of Generosity, Bayam. It took nearly five hours on a liner to reach it.\nOn the way, Klein bought a suit with local characteristics and a small suitcase to replace the clothes he changed out of, for a total of fourteen soli. They weren't even worth a pound.\nIt's really cheap. It's just change compared to a complete suit...Wearing pantaloons, a thick brown jacket, and a light brown cap, Klein disembarked from the liner with a native face that didn't stand out, and he entered some of the old ports on Symeem Island. He had spent time buying clothes and changing his appearance, causing him to miss the 9 o'clock ferry and be put in a situation where he could only take the ferry at 10.\nThinking of the expenses he had to pay for this acting, he couldn't help but calculate his current financial situation.\nThe Faceless characteristic was sold for 3,825 pounds. The pirate bounties net me 3,000 pounds. Although I haven't received the 6,825 pounds, I can basically include it into my budget as long as Mr. Hanged Man doesn't get exposed...\nThe leftover cash from Donna and company's gratuity add up to 255 pounds in bits and pieces...\nI found 26 pounds, 11 soli, and 8 pence from Steel Maveti's body...\nYes, there's still the five gold coins as reserves...\nI haven't spent much money recently, only spending slightly more than a pound in total. This is something to be happy about...\nWith that, I'll have 7,110 pounds. Moreover, I still have the Nightmare Beyonder characteristic and the murloc's bladder. They're still worth something.\nOn second thought, I earned a 3,000 pound bounty with a Zombie Beyonder characteristic. The latter is worth about 3,000 to 5,000 pounds. That is to say I earned about 7,000 pounds... This is only from Steel Maveti, Blood Brambles Hendry, and Squall. Besides, there was quite a lot of waste... Indeed, hunting pirates is quite a good job. It can administer justice, punish the evil, protect the weak and innocent, and also make me rich overnight...\nKlein subconsciously turned his head to the side, only to see that the color of the seawater was much clearer than that of Bayam's. It was as if the seawater was a huge, green, sparkling gem, reflecting golden rays under the sunlight.\nSure enough, it's not without reason that generations after generations of adventurers have gone out to sea to search for wealth. Even if I deduct the remnant spirituality of ancient wraiths, eyes from a six-winged gargoyle, spring water from Sonia Island's Golden Spring, and other supplementary ingredients of a Nimblewright Master, the money I have left will be enough to allow me to buy a decent manor here, in Desi Bay, in the Southern Continent's colonies, and in the non-metropolitan areas... Loen's countryside is said to be very beautiful, and if it turns out that I'm really unable to return, I can consider settling down in a similar place... Yes, I still have a 10% stake in the Backlund Bike Company, and my future returns won't be low...With confidence, Klein straightened his back and thought about the future.\nAfter letting his thoughts wander, Klein began to think about the more realistic question, which was whether he should sell the Nightmare Beyonder characteristic, find an opportunity to return it to the Church of Evernight, or create a mystical item with it through an Artisan.\nIt depends on the situation. The ideal solution would be to sell it to the Church...The martyr, Klein, who had taken two potions from the Nighthawks, thought with uncertainty.\nAt the same time, he hoped that Little Sun would soon reach Sequence 7 and be qualified to gain clearance to the methods used to remove the mental corruption from a Beyonder characteristic.\nAs for the matter of releasing the Priest of Light from the glove, he wasn't in a hurry. Little Sun had just received the potion formula for Sequence 7, so he had no need for it at the moment. He would have to wait for a long time, and the powers of a Priest of Light was very effective in dealing with a pirate like Admiral of Blood in a way that was far more potent than the Sun Brooch.\nAs his thoughts slowly settled down, Klein entered the small port town.\nThe place was basically filled with natives. Their skin was nearly bronze, and their black hair had slight, natural curls. Their bodies emitted a scent that was derived from prolonged contact with spices.\nAfter changing his appearance and asking about Raine's situation and if there was any news of Wendt's death, Klein found a secluded corner. He wiped his face with his hand, turning his face into a tall, thin Wendt with rather distinct facial features.\nHe carried his suitcase and circled around the town to its border. It was then that he saw the winery run by Raine's family.\nThe girl with flaxen-colored hair could no longer be called a young girl. She had obviously matured a lot compared to what Wendt remembered.\nShe was sweeping the entrance, and there was no one around.\nPhew...Klein took a deep breath and slowly let it out, feeling as though he was placed in a very difficult position.\nAs a powerful keyboard warrior, he knew about theories like method acting and experimental acting, but he lacked further understanding. He could only try to guess at Wendt's mood and performance in this kind of scenario.\nFinally, he closed his eyes and walked over.\nRaine looked up when she heard footsteps, finally identifying the visitor.\nShe opened her mouth slightly and let out a half-surprised exclamation before saying with a straight face, \"Why are you suddenly back?\"\nRemember, you're just acting...Klein revealed a smile.\n\"I came to bid you farewell.\"\nHe spoke in a local dialect, with a somewhat nondescript Bayam accent.\nThe language of the Rorsted Archipelago was also derived from ancient Feysac and belonged to another variant. As a half-historian, Klein was able to master it easily, and it only took him a short time to master it.\n\"Farewell?\" Raine asked, slightly surprised.\nKlein turned his head, looked to the side, and smiled.\n\"I'm going to chase after a treasure trove, and I don't know when I'll be able to come back.\n\"When the time comes, I'll appear with a great deal of money. I'll buy a manor in the suburbs; plant some rubber trees; set up a vineyard; have my own mill, wine cellar, blacksmith shop; and let the air be filled with the scent of all kinds of spices. Then, I'll buy a few slaves and hire some servants, just like those masters. Heh heh, but I'll still be short of one thing.\"\nHe overcame his goosebumps that were about to form on his skin, and he turned to look Raine in the eye.\n\"I still lack a wife and a mistress for the manor.\n\"Raine, I like you. I wish to marry you. The reason I said it out loud today isn't to get an answer, but because I'm afraid that I would never have the chance to tell you again.\"\nAfter listening quietly, Raine suddenly scolded angrily, \"Wendt, you're a coward!\"\nAh... This reaction isn't right...Klein deliberately revealed a surprised expression.\nRaine suppressed her voice and said, \"Three years ago, three freaking years ago, I was already prepared to head to Bayam with you. Yet, you didn't say anything in the end! You coward! You chicken!\n\"What's the use of telling me now? You're going to sea soon, and you may never come back!\"\nThe more she spoke, the more agitated she became.\n\"You've said it out loud and become happy. You have no regrets, but what about me? I'll have to constantly think about you returning and live on in pain? You selfish bastard!\"\nShe waved the broom in her hand and swung it towards Wendt.\nKlein knew that the real Wendt would have hit the broom away, hug the girl, and tell her that he wasn't going out to sea again, but he couldn't do the same. He had to pretend to be chased away pathetically, running all the way to a nearby alley. There, he hit his head against the wall while silently cursing himself.\nIt was too f**king awkward!\nThis is too f**king awkward!\nRaine went back to the door, picked up a broom, and crouched down.\nHer face was ashen; it was unknown what she was thinking about.\nVaguely, she heard a sound, and she fell asleep.\nAfter using the charm, Klein turned around and nudged Raine, who was sitting on the ground while leaning against the wall, then he quickly left the area, hiding in the distance to peep at the results.\nRaine quickly woke up and realized that she had fallen asleep without knowing it. Everything that had happened just now appeared like a dream.\nShe remained sitting there, motionless for quite a while.\nSuddenly, she lowered her head and let out a sharp curse that seemed to come from the depths of her throat.\n\"Wendt, you selfish bastard!\"\nSigh.Klein, who felt a tiny sensation of digesting his potion, sighed, changed his appearance, and left the place.\nHe would have to spend the night on Symeem Island, as there were no liners headed for Bayam until the morning."}
{"num_chp":535,"summary":"Unable to tolerate the situation, Danitz decided to do something about the situation.\nHe coughed twice and faced Vice Admiral Iceberg Edwina Edwards and said, \"Captain, Mr. Gehrman Sparrow has some questions for you?\"\nPhew...Klein let out a sigh of relief.\nIf this stare down continued, he felt as though his persona would collapse.\nEdwina gently nodded her head, looked at Klein, and said, \"Mr. Sparrow, have you received education?\"\nWhat kind of question is this?Klein's expression didn't change as he indifferently replied, \"University graduate.\"\nAh?Danitz looked at Gehrman Sparrow in surprise, unable to believe the fact that this crazy adventurer and bounty hunter had actually gone to university and even graduated!\nHe had no way of putting a university-a hallmark of wisdom-with that of Gehrman Sparrow together!\nUnless it's some \"Hunter University\" or \"Killer Academy\"... Or a university that exists only in the fantasies of madmen and psychopaths...Danitz couldn't help but lampoon silently.\nEdwina didn't seem surprised. She continued to ask, \"What languages have you mastered?\"\n\"...\"\nKlein resisted the urge to frown and said, \"Jotun, Elvish, Dragonese, ancient Hermes, Hermes, ancient Feysac, Loenese...\"\nEdwina responded tersely.\n\"Do you understand the other domains in mysticism?\"\nFeeling adrift for a moment, Klein felt like he had returned to his previous life's elementary school days. Due to his age handicap, he had been asked a series of questions by a teacher, such as how many Chinese characters he had mastered, if he had mastered the four arithmetic operations, whether he knew the English alphabet, and how many Tang dynasty poems he could recite...\nCalm down... You're Gehrman Sparrow now...Klein once again said without emotion, \"Adept.\"\nEdwina thought for two seconds and then explained in an unhurried manner, \"I have to combine your standard of knowledge with how I would answer the questions so that you can understand the answers more easily.\"\nThis...Klein was surprised to find that the beautiful lady in front of him was nothing like an adventurer acting as a part-time pirate. She was basically a teacher with a cold expression but a kind and patient attitude.\nHe calmed down after thinking about the vampire that headed for the Church of Mother Earth daily.\nThis is the first pirate admiral I'm officially meeting. She's indeed unique...Klein secretly sighed and said, \"First question, where do Beyonder creatures appear at sea? The commonly seen ones.\"\nHe didn't directly ask about mermaids, as he didn't want her to see through his real purpose, which would lead to unnecessary accidents.\nEdwina thought for a moment and then wiped the \"Soulfall Ritual\" off the blackboard. She then wrote and drew:\n\"Set off from Sonia Island, sail 1,200 nautical miles in this direction and you'll enter the depths of the sea which humans have never explored.\n\"There is a Naga tribe active there. They've been working hard to find the underwater city which is rumored to have a powerful demon sealed within. That's the entity of their faith...\"\nEdwina spoke in detail, partly from her own efforts to find the treasure itself, and partly from the knowledge and rumors she had exchanged.\nIt took her awhile to finish the general story, but to Klein's dismay, there were no mermaids anywhere except in the eastern waters of the Gargas Archipelago.\nHe quickly calmed his mood and said, \"Second question, do you know how to remove the mental corruption from a Beyonder characteristic?\"\nHe didn't hide the fact that he knew about Beyonder characteristics.\nEdwina's eyes flickered for the first time, as though she had a new understanding of Gehrman Sparrow.\nShe shook her head.\n\"I don't know.\n\"However, I once imagined that it's possible by borrowing the power of an external force and completely crushing the corrupted Beyonder characteristic to reduce it to the smallest specks of light. This way, whether it's corrupted or cursed, they will scatter having lost their vessel. They would rapidly or slowly vanish. As for the shattered Beyonder characteristic, it will gather bit by bit due to their particular traits, eventually taking form again.\n\"Unfortunately, only gods can do this. If you get the favor of any god, you can try to please \u2018Them' by offering enough sacrifices and pray for a response.\"\nThe law of convergence of Beyonder characteristics...In his mind, Klein filled in what Edwina had purposely left out.\nAt the same time, he couldn't help but sigh. This Vice Admiral Iceberg, Captain of the Golden Dream, was extremely knowledgeable in mysticism. She wasn't worse than him, someone who had read many of Roselle's diary entries and had experienced many things.\nIt was said that Vice Admiral Iceberg can replicate or simulate the Beyonder powers of her opponents when they use them in front of her... This is rather similar to Mr. Isengard Stanton's 2-081 ring...As soon as Klein's thoughts began to wander, he forcefully reined them back, and he nodded as if he was thinking about something.\n\"I agree with this hypothesis.\"\n\"Regretfully, I haven't done it in practice. It's only a conjecture.\" Edwina rarely used a word that described emotion.\nDanitz, who had been listening by the side, had a dazed look on his face. He was unable to keep up with the conversation at all.\nWhat are they talking about? What are they discussing? Why do I know every word, but know nothing when they're strung together... What's a Beyonder characteristic? What does shattering it do? What does it gathering together represent?Danitz looked left and right, his eyes blank.\nAt this point, Klein threw out the third question he had thought about.\n\"Where can you find ancient wraiths?\"\nHe only mentioned this kind of monster because the corresponding ingredients could also be used in the domain of Death. It didn't expose the secrets of his own Sequence.\nEdwina glanced at Danitz and said, \"I'll keep an eye out for you.\n\"If you want to attend Bayam's Beyonder gatherings, he knows a few. He can take you there.\"\nNot bad, it's easier to talk to smart people...Klein added, \"Do you know where there are people who can make mystical items out of Beyonder ingredients or characteristics?\"\n\"I met one at a gathering, but he never showed up again,\" Edwina answered frankly. \"I have grasped the corresponding knowledge. I can simulate it, but I cannot guarantee the success rate.\"\nHeh heh... I'll wait then...Klein didn't harp on the topic and switched to asking, \"How much do you know about Death's Key?\"\n\"Little.\" An iron black key suddenly appeared in Edwina's hand. It was about the size of a lyre; its shape was ancient, and it had a dark luster.\nThe pirate admiral said while half-carrying the item from the shipwreck, \"If you mean this key, then I can tell you that it belongs to the giants.\"\nKlein glanced sideways at Danitz.\n\"Your boatswain told me that it can also belong to a dragon or a demonic wolf.\"\n\"That was the earliest guess. I've recently found some historical documents. And with the help of the other items on the ship, I have a rudimentary idea.\" Edwina didn't show any agitation. She was filled with patience, but her expression remained cold.\nAfter finally regaining his sense as the owner of the dream, Danitz curiously asked, \"Captain, is it really the giants'?\"\n\"Yes.\" Edwina gave an affirmative answer. \"That batch of documents showed that there were still many giants active in the Fourth Epoch. Some of them had switched faiths to the God of Combat, while the others were left scattered, becoming the hunting targets of the humans.\n\"One of the tribes built a ship and tried to find the lost Giant King's Court at sea, never to return. The sunken ship we discovered, along with some of the items inside, are very similar to the relics they left behind in their original settlement, so we have sufficient reason to believe that the key belongs to the giants, and it is very likely to be pointed towards the lost Giant King's Court of their race before the Cataclysm.\"\nGiant King's Court? Little Sun said it's not far from the City of Silver...Klein didn't say a word, but he quietly listened to Vice Admiral Iceberg's description.\nI have to say, the City of Silver and the Forsaken Land of the Gods are things I know that completely surpasses other Beyonders... Hmm, even the seven gods can't find that place, or they find it hard to figure out the exact situation. In this aspect, I'm stronger than \u2018Them'...Klein thought about it with a smug and self-deprecating manner before saying in a deep voice, \"If I offer a sufficient price, are you willing to sell the key?\"\n\"Of course, unless I acquire additional clues to the Giant King's Court.\" Edwina continued to speak at a moderate pace.\nVery good, if the Tarot Club organizes an expedition to the Giant King's Court one day, I will buy this key...Klein was about to ask the last question when he suddenly remembered the four adventurers.\nRelying on the power of the Dream Charm, he conjured the lady with greenish-gray eyes, who wore a man's shirt, and her three companions.\n\"Do you know them?\"\nEdwina took a glance and said almost without thinking, \"Leticia Dolera, an archaeologist and adventurer.\n\"Rumor has it that she's a member from the Moses Ascetic Order or the Element Dawn.\"\nMoses Ascetic Order... The ancient organization that believes in the Hidden Sage... It really isn't for money, and their goal is definitely something from the abandoned temple...Klein asked casually, \"What do you know about Element Dawn?\"\nThis mysterious organization was similar to the Psychology Alchemists, having been born in the recent one to two hundred years. It combined the elements of various schools of mysticism. It had its own set of theories, and its members were all proficient in spell casting and had mastery in many ancient witchcraft techniques.\nEdwina pursed her lips and said, \"They've always been fighting against the Moses Ascetic Order.\n\"Rumor has it that the eldest daughter of Emperor Roselle, Bernadette Gustav, established it.\"\nThe Element Dawn is headed by Bernadette? Zaratul's prophecy is quite accurate after all. She can really be considered an important figure in the Beyonder world...Klein sighed inwardly, feeling somewhat enlightened.\nHe resisted the urge to sigh and looked at Edwina. He calmly said, \"One last question.\"\nWhen the beautiful lady and Blazing Danitz's attention was fully focused on him, he slowly opened his mouth.\n\"Are you interested in cooperating?\"\n\"What kind of cooperation?\" Edwina returned with a question.\nThe smile on Klein's face became more and more exuberant, with a hint of madness in it he said, \"Hunt Admiral of Blood.\""}
{"num_chp":735,"summary":"Sharron was silent for two seconds before she said, \"I'll help ask.\"\nIt means you need to consider it? That's right. The negative effects of Scales of Luck does leave one hesitant. However, Biological Poison Bottle is really compatible with a Wraith. If it wasn't because I'm short on money, and how it lowers my immunity, making me easily fall sick, I wouldn't be willing to sell it. It's rather effective in an ambush!Klein vaguely grasped Sharron's intentions as he stuffed the silver necklace back into his collar.\nHe asked after some thought, \"Which power of a High-Sequence Prisoner pathway Beyonder makes all surrounding lifeless items attack one's target?\"\n\"Puppet,\" Sharron succinctly replied.\nIt's the power of a Sequence 4 Puppet? Turning themselves into a lifeless puppet, so that they are able to control all lifeless objects in a certain range? Advancing further, will they be able to directly influence the mystical items of an enemy?Klein nodded in enlightenment and asked, \"Then, do you know that demigod?\"\nHe immediately described in detail the appearance of the elder who had attacked him outside Bayam.\n\"Shanks,\" Sharron calmly said a name.\nI actually wished that you could share with me more about him...Klein knew Miss Sharron's style as he said with an exasperated smile, \"Then, do you know Zatwen?\"\nHe was the mentor of the Naturism Sect's leader in Oravi Island.\n\"The demigod who was pursuing us,\" Sharron answered without hiding anything or any emotions, like a doll.\nThat's the one who made me feel like the chairs, tables, and curtains wished to kill me... What a coincidence... However, it wasn't arranged. It just proves that as a secret organization, the Rose School of Thought, with a history of over a thousand years, doesn't have that many demigods... Perhaps it has about the same number as the Aurora Order. The number of saints number around five, and the number of angels and Grade 0 Sealed Artifacts number about two to three... Of course, this is also because they were suppressed by the seven major Churches, reducing their headquarters to colonies. At the height of their powers, they might've had far more than these...Klein thought and asked again, \"Then, do you know the Rose School of Thought member that is able to make an entire mountain tremble with just one arm?\"\nHe planned on describing the arm's traits, but he realized that he hadn't dared to look straight at it.\nSharron listened quietly as her eyes darted around as though they came to life. She asked with a clear voice, \"What did you encounter?\"\nA saint, an angel, as well as Sea King, an Aurora Order demigod, a monster byproduct from the Numinous Episcopate's Artificial Death...Klein silently made a self-deprecating comment as he said with a wry smile, \"I got on the bad side with the Mother Tree of Desire, and I suffered an ambush from the Rose School of Thought. Thankfully, I was in Bayam, allowing the Church of Storms and the kingdom's military to take action. I also threw out an item corrupted with the True Creator's aura, as well as something related to the Numinous Episcopate. In short, it was chaos, and I took the opportunity to escape.\"\nHe replied frankly, apart from hiding the existence of Miss Messenger and Mr. Azik. As for the matter of the True Creator, he believed that Miss Sharron had long known that he wasn't affected by the ravings. This could be explained by a timely psychological intervention or psychic treatment.\n\"Mother Tree of Desire...\" Sharron murmured the name as rare emotional upheavals slowly appeared in her eyes.\nKlein didn't have the interpretation abilities of a Spectator, and he was unable to tell what was exactly on Sharron's mind. He could only sense that she felt a little fear and loathing.\nSharron quickly restrained her abnormal reaction, turning back into an extremely exquisite \"doll.\"\nShe looked at Sherlock Moriarty and said, \"You are very lucky and very mysterious.\"\nKlein smiled without a word, neither lying nor explaining.\nSharron didn't inquire as she said, \"You might've met Suah. \u2018He' is an Abomination born 922 years ago and claims to be the son of the Chained God. \u2018He' is also the present leader of the Rose School of Thought.\"\nNo way. The Rose School of Thought sent its leader and a demigod to deal with me... I'm just a mere Sequence 5! If not for Orange Light Hilarion's warning, I might've already been captured by the Rose School of Thought...Klein felt a chill run down his back again as he asked, \"Is Abomination the name of the Prisoner pathway's Sequence 2 or Sequence 1?\"\n\"Probably,\" Sharron didn't give an affirmative answer.\nAt this moment, without waiting for Klein's response, she said, \"Williams Street has been destroyed.\"\nKlein had pondered what kind of reaction he should have when Miss Sharron raised the topic, so he immediately frowned.\n\"By who? When did it happen?\"\n\"The Nighthawks and Machinery Hivemind. About two months ago.\" Sharron had clearly gathered the corresponding intelligence.\nKlein nodded solemnly and, after some deep thought, said, \"Perhaps we've neglected something. That evil spirit didn't need us to rescue it. It was still controlling Baronet Pound!\n\"Could it be that something happened to that gentleman, incurring the notice of the Nighthawks and Machinery Hiveminds?\" Klein offered a guess filled with half-truths without utmost confidence.\nSharron nodded.\n\"Baronet Pound died during one of his revelries.\"\nThat's it? That's the end to Alista Tudor's final bloodline?Klein thought and said, \"How's the situation with Williams Street at the moment?\"\n\"Some high-rise buildings are being built,\" Sharron described without much of an expression. \"People monitored it in secret at the beginning, but the surveillance decreased with time, diminishing to zero early last month.\"\nKlein pondered for a few seconds and said, \"Have you gone down to explore it?\"\nSharron's eyes swept his face.\n\"No.\"\nThis is her remembering our unwritten agreement-to explore it together because we found it together? What a noble-hearted lady. The Rose School of Thought's temperance faction is infinitely times better than the indulgence faction!Klein probed, \"Shall we go now?\"\n\"Alright,\" Sharron succinctly expressed her stance.\nKlein immediately instructed the carriage driver, and he changed the destination to Williams Street at the intersection of West Borough and Empress Borough.\nAlong the way, he casually mentioned what he heard and saw at sea, as well as the experiences that didn't involve his secrets. Although Sharron didn't answer him, she listened attentively, seemingly interested.\nThis made Klein recall the time when he first got to know her as Miss Bodyguard. She sat on the illusory high-back chair in the oriel window's glass. Her right hand held her cheek as she seriously listened to his conversation with Ian. She had great potential in being a Spectator.\nThe carriage passed through the silent streets in the drizzle before finally arriving near Williams Street.\nWithout approaching the area, Klein and Sharron discovered that the area had become a huge worksite.\nAfter circling to the region that matched the underground ruins, they stood behind a huge tree with a lush canopy. Klein said to Sharron, who wasn't drenched by the rain despite not holding an umbrella, \"Let's head down.\"\nAs the rain fell, they passed through Sharron's blonde hair and body before hitting the ground.\n\"Alright.\" Sharron didn't ask how Sherlock Moriarty was planning on heading down with her.\nKlein reached his hand into his pocket and easily removed the wall of spirituality, and he opened the iron cigar case.\nBeside him, a figure suddenly appeared. It was none other than Admiral of Blood Senor who wore a dark red coat and an old triangular hat.\n\"He will head down in my stead,\" Klein said with a smile.\nImmediately following that, he controlled his marionette in a composed manner.\nSenor immediately pressed his hand to his chest and bowed at Sharron.\n\"Good evening. I'm honored to work with you.\"\nSharron swept her gaze across Klein and Senor, and without a word, her body sank into the soil.\nUh, Miss Sharron seems to detest Senor quite significantly...Klein curled his lips and made Admiral of Blood rapidly turn into a Wraith and sink.\nAs for himself, he leaned on a tree, half-closed his eyes as he seriously controlled the marionette. There wasn't anyone around him, and the drizzle was light and the streetlights dim.\nSlowly, Klein found the feeling of being a Marionettist.\nHis vision and Senor's vision overlapped with one another as he saw black-brown soil, squirming worms, and miscellaneous items in between the rocks.\nAs they passed through layers of obstacles, they arrived at the region where the ruin once was. The dome ceiling had collapsed and the stone columns had snapped. The area was filled with soil and rubble, looking nothing like it once was.\nSuch a scene made Klein believe that the humanoid statues of the six deities had been completely destroyed.\nTo his joy, their location was relatively close to the room which sealed the evil spirit. That meant that he didn't need to worry that any subsequent exploration would exceed the hundred-meter range for the control of his marionette.\nAmidst the smell of soil and rot, they soon entered the previously menacing room; however, between the rubble and soil, there were only a few signs of crushed bone and rotting clothes. The dark gold and deep blue light from before had all vanished.\nThe Beyonder characteristics have been taken away by the Nighthawks and Machinery Hivemind...Senor's expression twitched as it perfectly reflected Klein's mood.\nSharron turned around in the dark solid environment and gently shook her head.\n\"They didn't send anyone in. There are no traces of living creatures existing in here.\"\nThat's right. If a living person had entered and exited this room over the past half year, a Wraith should be able to sense it... Besides, the deity statues obviously cannot be seen by the Nighthawks and Machinery Hivemind... Where did those Beyonder characteristics go?As Klein frowned, Senor had a similar reaction.\nCould it be that the evil spirit wasn't completely obliterated? It had long escaped?Klein thought about it when he suddenly came to an alarming conclusion.\nHe held back his emotions and made Senor pass through the soil and rubble-filled room with Sharron, and they arrived at the spot where the bloody door previously stood. And at that moment, only a few splinters proved that it existed before.\nAfter proceeding forward a few meters, the two truly entered the room where the evil spirit was sealed.\nIt had likewise been destroyed and buried. Klein used Senor's body and eyes to look for clues as he flew about.\n\"There should be a black high-back chair here.\" Sharron stopped and pointed at the splinters above two rocks.\nKlein instantly recalled the scene he had once seen in the dream-the young man suspected of being Medici had sat on a high-back chair, his head drooped low as though dead.\nSharron didn't pause. She continued proceeding in the compressed soil in search for any traces. Suddenly, she spoke again.\n\"There should be one here.\"\nAnother one? A second black high-back chair?\"Klein\" floated over in surprise."}
{"num_chp":285,"summary":"Audrey, who had set up an urgent communication method with Xio and Fors, quickly passed on Mr. Fool's message to the two ladies through the huge golden retriever, Susie, claiming that the information she had received came via other sources.\nIn the corner of an old church, as Xio was thinking about how to confirm Lanevus's identity, or how she should create chaos and avenge Williams, she unfolded the ball of paper.\n... There's no need to confirm. He's Lanevus?Xio's eyes widened as she quickly skimmed through the rest of the paper's content. The piece of paper clearly wrote:\n\"The only choice is to notify the Church of the Evernight Goddess.\n\"Alert them that Lanevus has the godhood of the True Creator on him.\"\n\"Godhood? The True Creator's godhood?\" Xio blurted out as she looked at the golden retriever in front of her in shock, only to realize that she was equally dumbfounded.\n\"What?\" Fors was listening when she suddenly felt something was amiss. She hurriedly reached out for the piece of paper and scanned it.\nAfter a moment, she curled her lips and said at a loss, \"This... this must be a joke, right?\n\"How did we get involved in a matter that's tied to an evil god's godhood?\"\nThis was meant to involve the capture of a cunning swindler worth only 200 pounds!\nIn response to Fors's question, Susie could only express the notion that she was only a dog and that she didn't know what was happening either with her innocent eyes.\nNot expecting a dog to answer her questions, she turned her head to Xio and said, \"I'm afraid Miss Audrey isn't as naive and innocent as we thought. She has many secrets.\n\"This might be a power struggle between a cult, the nobles and the Church.\n\"However, it's evident that she didn't know about the matter of godhood prior to this. She's also being used by someone. Hmm... That person could be her father, Count Hall.\"\n\"What's fortunate is that this matter ends here. You don't need to take the risk anymore. After you get someone to make the report, you just need to wait to collect the bounty in peace.\"\nXio was startled and said, \"That's true...\n\"Hopefully, those Nighthawks are able to avenge Williams. They're so strong, so they'll definitely be able to do it. Definitely...\"\nBefore she finished speaking, she suddenly turned her head to the side and spoke as if she was talking to herself, \"I'm still too weak.\n\"Too weak...\"\nXio jerked her hand up, covering her mouth and nose.\n...\nI'm still too weak... If not for that, I would've chosen to take revenge myself, but right now I can only take a step back... Not to mention there's \u2018Giant' and those hidden helpers around Lanevus. With just his godhood, he isn't someone I can deal with... With the reaction speed of the Nighthawks, they'll likely take action tonight once they receive the report. The Backlund diocese is second only to the Church's headquarters. They have many Sealed Artifacts and many powerful Beyonders. There's no need to wait for any additional helpers...After completing his task of informing Audrey, Klein returned to the real world. He stuck on a beard, changed his hairstyle, and stared into the mirror for several minutes.\nHe felt anticipation and excitement, as well as depression and a sense of powerlessness.\nBefore the evening arrived, he left the Quelaag Club and returned to Minsk Street. On his way, he went to the grocery market and found a stall that was bustling with its great business. He bought several masks, including a clown's.\nHe had decided to watch the hunt for Lanevus tonight!\nHe wanted to see the other party pay the price for his madness with his own eyes!\nOf course, with his strength, he could only watch from a distance and not even have the right to approach them.\nBy eleven o'clock, when many people were in their dreams, Klein changed into his grayish-blue worker's uniform and disguised himself as he had the night before. Then, he put on his cap, walked a few streets away, and took a rental carriage to the Backlund Bridge area.\nOnce there, he switched to walking and walked all the way to the East Balam Dock.\nHis interview yesterday included questions such as \"where are you staying now\" and \"how's the environment like.\" Therefore, he knew very well that Lanevus would be staying in the dormitory provided by the Dock Union at night.\nHowever, Klein didn't go near it. Instead, he carefully went around it. His target was the clock tower of the East Balam Dock.\nIn Backlund, in addition to the large church with its tall, iconic clock tower, many government buildings were also equipped with one. However, they weren't necessarily tall, grand, and not ornate. It was mostly built for pragmatic reasons, such as this one in the East Balam Dock.\nCompared to the surrounding buildings that reached a maximum of three stories, it was like a giant that stood high in the night sky as it overlooked the entire area.\nKlein easily entered the interior of the clock tower and went up the endless flight of spiral stairs as he moved quickly in the darkness.\nFinally, he arrived at his destination. He arrived at the top of the gigantic wall clock. It was surrounded by a dark yellow fence, and at the top of his head was a steeple that could be reached by stretching his hand.\nTaking a few steps forward, Klein hid in the shadows, got a sense of his bearings, and looked towards the Dock Union's dormitory.\nIt was a two-story, brick-red building, and the occasional pedestrian resembled a black dot in Klein's eyes.\nHe stared for a few seconds, then took a step back, and sank into the darkness.\nAt the same time, he took out his newly bought mask and wore it.\nIt was a clown with the corner of its mouth sharply raised and a painted red nose.\nA happy clown.\n...\nWearing a clown mask, Klein stood in the rich darkness, patiently waiting for the predetermined show.\nHe waited for two hours.\nWhen the hands of the large wall clock passed one o'clock, he suddenly saw something flying from the distance.\nIt was a huge airship covered in dark black paint!\nIf it weren't for the faint moonlight, it would've been indistinguishable from the night sky. Unlike what was described in the newspapers and magazines, depicting them as machines that emitted exaggerated mechanical noises, its oars rotated quietly, as silent as a vulture who had found its prey but hadn't found a chance.\nThe solid, light alloy supported the cotton frame, and below it hung the compartment for guns, projectile launchers, and cannons. At a glance, it appeared to be a powerful deterrent.\nIt's silent... Is this a temporary result caused by Beyonder means?Klein, wearing his clown mask, looked at the slowly descending airship and made a guess.\nAt this moment, he was most puzzled over the dispatch of an airship for a small-scale Beyonder battle in a densely populated area of the city!\nAren't they afraid of dealing collateral damage to the surrounding citizens? Aren't they afraid of causing panic?\nVery soon, the airship hovered about 10 meters in the air. This way, Klein was even less worried about being discovered. His position was much higher than them!\nObserving the situation below, he suddenly had a hunch. It was likely that the airship wouldn't engage in combat, but rather provide air surveillance of the area to give the personnel involved in the operation a better view and prevent the target from escaping if any accidents occurred.\nRight at this moment, three figures dressed in black robes suddenly appeared in front of the two story brick-red building.\nThe man in the lead didn't wear a hat, revealing his short golden brown hair and blackish-green eyes which appeared to be as deep as a windless lake.\nThe collars of his shirt and windbreaker were propped up high, and his palms were covered with a layer of gloves that were as red as blood!\nA silver-white metal suitcase was wound around his left hand via a chain of the same color.\nThis was one of the of the nine high-ranking deacons of the Church of the Evernight Goddess, Crestet Cesimir. He was also one of the three powerhouses of the Red Gloves and he happened to be in Backlund.\nAfter looking straight ahead, Cesimir turned his head to the left and said to his subordinate, \"Use Sealed Artifact 1-63.\"\n\"Yes, Your Grace.\" The Nighthawk crouched down and helped Cesimir untie the chain around the silver suitcase.\nThroughout the entire process, Crestet Cesimir's muscles were very tense, as though he was fighting something.\nThe Nighthawk on the left took a deep breath and pressed down suddenly, causing the illusionary ripples on the surface of the silver box to crack.\nThe surrounding halo suddenly disappeared as if it was completely sucked into the case. A bone sword, that was less than a meter-long, emitted glossy, pure white light as it slowly floated up.\nIts blade had an ancient silver-coated mirror attached to it.\nThe scenes reflected in the mirror were layered and superimposed without end.\nThe Nighthawk on the left took the mirror and pointed it at the brick-red building.\nThe building was clearly reflected in it, and nothing seemed to change.\nHowever, Cesimir slowly exhaled, stretched out his left hand to grasp the short bone sword.\nThe surrounding halo was somewhat restored.\n\"Let's go in.\" He started walking towards the entrance of the brick building.\nThe three Nighthawks opened the door and entered the dark building and targeted the stairs that led to the second floor.\nAt that moment, a tall, thin figure emerged from the shadows in the corner. He wore a black priest's uniform, and he had curly, pale yellow hair and beastly dark brown eyes.\n\"You're the Goddess's Sword?\" The nearly-two-meter-tall \"Giant\" spoke in a deep voice.\nAt the same time, he clenched his right palm.\nBang! Bang! Bang!\nThe Union members in this small brick-red building exploded one after another in their dreams, without even having the chance to scream.\nTheir bodies split into pieces, turning into thick, sticky flesh. Half of their bodies rushed towards the \"Giant\" to weave into cloaks that could reduce magical damage. The other half condensed into furry giant rugs that blanketed the three Nighthawks.\nCrestet Cesimir only watched silently without doing anything.\nSilently, the flesh and blood dissipated and collapsed before falling down like rain, but the raindrops didn't stain the floor red.\nIn each of the rooms, figures emerged once more, still sleeping soundly.\n\"This is the world within a mirror, a mirror world that only targets Beyonders. The flesh bombs you planted in the bodies of the ordinary people are only illusions in here.\" Cesimir raised the Holy Artifact bone sword in his right hand, causing the light around him to disappear.\n\"Hmph!\" the \"Giant\" suddenly grabbed his left shoulder with his right hand and tore off his arm. He then threw the blood arm forward!\nBoom!\nHis arm exploded like a bomb, turning into a rain of blood that rained down on the three Nighthawks.\nAt the same time, the flesh on his left shoulder began to squirm madly as he slowly grew a new arm which was still bloody without any skin.\nSmack! Smack! Smack!\nSizzle!\nThe blood-colored raindrops accurately avoided Cesimir and the others before falling to the ground and quickly corroding into deep, dark traces.\nBut no matter how hard they tried, they always missed the three Nighthawks by a hair's breadth, as if they were fated to do so.\n\"My enemies aren't always lucky enough.\" The corners of Cesimir's mouth curled up, and with a slip of his foot, he instantly appeared in front of \"Giant.\"\nGiant's eyes narrowed as his body suddenly melted like a candle, turning into sticky flesh and blood that quickly seeped into the floor.\nCesimir immediately kneeled and plunged the Holy Artifact bone sword into the ground.\n\"No!\"\nIn the rich darkness, a roar filled with pain and horror instantly sounded, and it was immediately swallowed up by tranquility and serenity.\nCesimir stood up and drew out the bone sword. A drop of dark red blood was slowly dripping down its tip, and on the floor, flesh and blood were seeping out, congealing into a face of despair. It was precisely the \"Giant\" who had a slightly drooping mouth.\nPat! Pat! Pat!\nThree shadows appeared around Cesimir in succession. However, they all mysteriously collapsed to the ground, having been forcefully taken down by many invisible entities!\nBang! Bang! Bang!Another Nighthawk fired, and the silver surface of the bullet seemed to bear the Evernight Sacred Emblem.\nThe three attackers hiding in the shadows suddenly revealed themselves, twitching as they lost their breath.\n\"Rose Bishop, Shadow Ascetic... People from the Aurora Order.\" Cesimir frowned and said in a low voice without turning to his companions, \"There's something wrong about this. It's very strange. All of you be careful.\"\nBefore he could finish his words, he heard the shuffling of footsteps which echoed in the silence and serenity.\nImmediately, he saw Lanevus with his chiseled face dressed in a linen shirt walking down the dark staircase. He appeared calm and placid without any signs of fear.\n\"I'm very curious. To the Aurora Order, you should be a blasphemer. Why would they send people to protect you?\" Cesimir didn't seem to notice the abnormality as he asked casually.\nLanevus showed his trademark taunting smile and said, \"That's simple.\n\"Because I'm no longer just Lanevus.\"\nHe paused for a moment, and his gaze suddenly turned cold.\n\"Now, I'm even more of the True Creator!\"\nHe yanked open his linen shirt, revealing the dark red flesh of his skinless chest and abdomen.\nThe flesh and blood were conjoined together, forming the figure of a hanged man!\nAll of a sudden, the void around them shattered like glass, and all the scenes around them crumbled.\nThis was the aura of a deity."}
{"num_chp":916,"summary":"Chapter 916 Irresistible Approach\nUpon seeing this coiling feathered serpent deep inside the black fog, and a face at the top of the towering figure, Azik was first taken aback. Following that, the corner of his forehead throbbed as though he had been struck in the temple, splitting his head in two.\nAmidst the excruciating pain, several incontiguous scenes flashed in his mind;\nIt was a feathered serpent with a face identical to his, even to the smallest detail;\nAbove a silent land, there were countless pale corpses;\nFloating in midair, there were clouds stacked from bones that came from different species;\nBlack tentacles that drilled out from the ground, with eyes that resembled dead fish at the tip of each tentacle;\nA transparent Spirit Body was forcefully pulled out of his body.\nAfter these flashing scenes, a pair of white flaming eyes that were on the brink of extinguishing glanced over. A white feather stained with yellow oil fluttered down, splitting Azik's transparent Spirit Body into two.\nOne of the parts suddenly flew up and plunged inside the \"cloud of bones.\" The remaining part fused with a golden accessory that had appeared out of thin air. Amidst the pale-white flames, it materialized back into a body of flesh and blood.\nThis scene was like a thunder god's hammer striking down at Azik's mind, again and again, making the pain hardly bearable. He raised his hand to his head as his knees gradually buckled as he knelt on the staircase.\nHe had finally recalled everything that had happened, and he understood the reason why he was constantly dying and reviving, always losing his memories and having to recover them every single time.\nHis soul wasn't complete!\nSimilarly, Azik also understood why the feathered serpent suppressing the entire space in the depths of the black fog had an identical face as his.\nIt was him!\nThat was the other Azik Eggers!\nAnd all of this was a concealed attempt before Death's fall.\nIf stitching souls existed, there was naturally the splitting of souls. At that moment, the crazy and powerful Death had seemingly foreseen \"His\" outcome. Unwilling to die so simply, \"He\" secretly split the soul of his son, Balam Empire's Death Consul. He took half of it away and used another item as a replacement, stitching it together with Azik's soul.\nIt was a mystery if it was a deliberate arrangement of Death, or if it was an unintended consequence of the Numinous Episcopate's Artificial Death Project, the half soul that had been taken away from Artificial Death had fused with the target of the Artificial Death Project-the Uniqueness of the Death pathway. It made the latter gain certain innate abilities as it began influencing High-Sequence Beyonders of the Corpse Collector pathway who had failed their advancement.\nAnd for the other half, although there was a replacement that prevented it from being incomplete, the incomplete soul resulted in repeated deaths and resurrection just like Sequence 4's Undying. And due to the golden accessory inside his body, and the calling from the other half soul, Azik, who started a brand new life every incarnation, would gradually recover his past memories with the passage of time.\nIn the past, Artificial Death had attempted to identify the reason, but due to the natural recovery of his memories, he was often already close to death once more. He wasn't able to perform any in-depth investigations. Furthermore, the Numinous Episcopate's Artificial Death Project had been raised in the past few centuries. It was only in recent times that they received some level of success. That was why he never found the answer.\nHaa! Haa! Haa!\nAt some point in time, Azik's hands had left his head. They were placed on the staircase as his throat produced a voice that didn't sound human.\nDrops of sweat dripped down his forehead and hit the stone steps in front of him. They spread out into a layer of pale yellow oil, growing out into dense white feathers.\nAt that instant, he felt the other half of his soul calling out, as well as its desire. The two \"selves\" which had been separated for more than a thousand years were eager to fuse as one, to be whole again.\n\"No...\" Azik muttered in pain, unwilling to raise his head or reach out his right hand.\nHe had seen it clearly. The \"him\" as a feathered serpent didn't have any reason. It was filled with extreme coldness and madness. If he became one with it again, he would probably immediately be restored to his state as a Death Consul from before. He might even become a fake Death who only had godhood with zero humanity!\nHe would forget everything, forgetting everyone who he had once cherished.\n\"No...\" Azik's throat squeezed out the same word again. Irresistibly, he raised his neck bit by bit as pitch-black and gloomy scales appeared.\nAt his forehead, something that took a life of its own protruded out. His forehead cracked as a bloody opening appeared.\nA golden sliver of light emitted out of nothingness, taking form inside the flesh and blood.\nThis ancient accessory made of gold was in the shape of a tall, slender bird. Pale white flames emanated around it in the form of feathers. Inside its bronze eyes, there were shimmering layers of light that separately formed a mysterious and illusory door.\nThe moment it appeared, Azik let out a painful growl. He raised his head completely as two wisps of pale-white flames burst in his eyes that had experienced much.\nDeep inside the black fog, the illusory and real feathered serpent had straightened its body. It reached its head out as the two identical faces of different sizes looked at each other in silence.\nAs four pale-white flames leaped, bit by bit, Azik, whose hands were on the ground, struggled to stand up with a warped expression. Slowly, he walked to the feathered serpent known as Artificial Death.\nAs he approached, the entire mausoleum began shaking. The surroundings turned transparent, reflecting a world with countless skeletons and shadows.\nBloody arms, bluish-black vines with baby faces, and slimy tentacles with dead fish eyes or two rows of sharp teeth tore through the boundary between reality and the illusory, reaching into the mausoleum. However, they clung straight to the ground without daring to move.\nEast Balam, Kolain City.\nDaly Simone, who was rushing to her next target's location, suddenly stopped in her steps and held her head.\n\"What's wrong?\" Red Gloves team captain, Soest, asked in puzzlement.\nDaly frowned slightly as she answered, seemingly in reverie, \"I hear strange voices. I can sense the calling that stems from an unknown place... I even wish to kneel to the ground...\"\n\"Can the rest of you hear it?\" Soest prudently asked the other teammates.\nJust as Leonard Mitchell shook his head, he heard the slightly-aged voice in his mind.\n\"Look towards the Berserk Sea.\"\nLeonard subconsciously turned his body and looked in the direction of the harbor towards the distant Berserk Sea. He saw a swath of pure, deep-black darkness. There weren't any gales, massive waves, dark clouds, lightning, torrential rain, or sunlight.\nAlthough Klein had his eyes closed, his outstanding spiritual perception allowed him to sense his surroundings. When he heard the painful murmurs and shouts that sounded like Mr. Azik, he could sense seemingly corporeal silence and the aura of death.\nWhat's happening? Although the Artificial Death deep in the mausoleum didn't attack Mr. Azik, it has inflicted him with adverse effects? Klein's mind raced as he felt anxious and worried.\nHis spiritual intuition told him that what was about to happen was not something he wished to see.\nHowever, he couldn't figure out what he could do. He didn't even dare open his eyes to look at Mr. Azik's present state or whatever he had encountered.\nThis wasn't a problem that could be solved with mere courage. It was a difference in the natural order of life, an unbridgeable gap.\nSuddenly, Klein had a strong feeling of helplessness. However, he didn't give up as he tried hard to think of whatever items he had on him that could be of use.\nCreeping Hunger? No, it's at a completely different level. It won't be of any use...\nDeath Knell? Even worse...\nGroselle's Travels? I didn't bring it... Neither did I bring the Black Emperor card and Tyrant card...\nFate Siphon charm... Yes, the Fate Siphon charm!\nKlein was delighted as he formulated a plan.\nIt was to use the Fate Siphon charm to temporarily swap his fate with Mr. Azik. He would suffer the influence created by Artificial Death in his place!\nAt the very least, I still have a chance of reviving. As for Mr. Azik, the deaths he previously suffered wouldn't from the damage inflicted. Who knows if he can awaken again in such a situation! Klein didn't consider if the Fate Siphon charm was effective on Azik and Artificial Death. He only wished to give it a try. He raised his right hand and reached into his pocket.\nThen, there was a delay in his actions.\nHis arm rose a little before landing back in its original location.\nHe froze for a moment as though he had been petrified into being a stone sculpture.\nKlein's lips quivered a few times as his expression distorted indiscernibly. Following that, he swung his right arm and reached his palm into his pocket and pulled it out.\nGripped tightly in his palm was a black crystal card-like charm.\nAt the same time, Azik was approaching the towering illusory feathered serpent. His footsteps sped up as though he was returning to his throne.\nHowever, his eyes which had pale-white flames were filled with pain. His expression was extremely warped.\n\"No...\" Azik muttered once again. Wherever his skin was exposed, white feathers stained with yellow oil grew out from the gaps of pitch-black scales.\nThe intense shouting and desire made him lose control of himself. He was about to soar into the sky and leap towards the gigantic feathered serpent that shared his face.\nPale-white flames spread out from the bird-shaped accessory at his forehead, flowing towards the rest of his body.\nKlein's spiritual intuition was sending warnings as he hurriedly said a single word in ancient Hermes, \"Fate!\"\nJust as he was about to use the charm, his surroundings suddenly quietened. There was no longer any sound.\nA slender, fair female palm appeared out of nowhere and pressed down on the golden bird-shaped accessory on Azik's forehead.\nA figure then materialized between Azik and the towering illusory feathered serpent, stopping the two's approach.\nWith the help of this external force, Azik finally held back that desire and the irresistible calling to fuse together. The pale-white flames in his eyes \"reflected\" the floating figure in midair.\nIt was a beautiful lady wearing an ancient robe. She wore a black hood. Her face was deadpan, and her black eyes were deep and dark, devoid of spirituality."}
{"num_chp":453,"summary":"Red Rose Manor, outside the luxurious rooms filled with all kinds of antiques.\nKlein stood at the door and asked the sixth maid he had met today.\nThe young maid was wearing a black-and-white servant dress that had the characteristics of the times. She was pretty, in her prime, and had natural curls to her brown hair. She had a hint of playfulness on her face.\n\"Who does Mr. Talim meet when he visits?\" Klein repeated the question numbly.\nThe maid replied almost without a pause, \"Mr. Talim usually requests to meet His Highness, or to accompany him in riding horses, or to discuss matters. If His Highness happens to be absent, he will meet with that lady. They are very good friends. He receives permission from the butler.\"\nTalim is good friends with the commoner lady who Prince Edessak likes? Meeting in private from time to time? It was likely that he was persuading her to leave this place, so as to not affect the reputation of the Prince...Klein nodded thoughtfully.\n\"They, I mean-Mr. Talim and the young lady, what would they talk about?\"\nWhen he asked this question, Klein suddenly recalled how Talim had fallen in love just recently. With his rich \"experience\" from the information age, he somehow came up with an extremely contrived romance story.\nThe maid wasn't afraid of the detective. She smiled, shook her head, and said, \"At times like these, we're all asked to leave the room.\"\nThis...Even more than ever, Klein couldn't resist making associations, even to the point of changing the\u00a0colors1of Prince Edessak's hat and helmet.\nWithout waiting for him to ask any further questions, the maid chuckled and said, \"Detective Moriarty, if you want to find out exactly what the lady and Mr. Talim were talking about, you can ask her directly.\"\n\"The old butler doesn't permit that.\" Klein confidently pushed out his scapegoat.\nHe changed the topic and said with a smile, \"You seem to know more than the other servants. You even know to call me Detective Moriarty.\"\nThe maid looked around, maintained her smile, and said, \"It's because I've been serving the lady during my rotations. She's always wanted to meet you, Detective Moriarty. After all, she's close friends with Mr. Talim and cares a great deal about his death.\n\"Unfortunately, she always ends up missing you.\"\n\"Always?\" Klein was sensitive to the words \"always,\" \"just happened,\" and \"missed.\"\nThe maid nodded seriously and said, \"The first time His Highness invited you to be his guest, she intentionally threw a tantrum and wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to walk downstairs to meet you. Who knew that you would leave in a hurry.\n\"Afterwards, she took the initiative to represent His Highness to place flowers on Mr. Talim's grave, but as she didn't know what you looked like, she wasn't able to find you.\n\"And today, she just happened to go to the golf course out back to relax on horseback. Otherwise, even if the butler didn't allow it, she would've tried to find a way to meet you.\"\nWhat a coincidence...Klein sighed as he suddenly grasped a crucial point.\nOn the day of Talim's funeral, it was the commoner lady he loved who had offered flowers in the prince's place!\nOn that day, Klein was most concerned about the lady with the black veil and the sapphire ring on her finger. She might have a Grade 0 Sealed Artifact or some powerful existence of an equal level!\nAll of a sudden, a thought flashed through Klein's mind-the woman with the sapphire ring on her finger was wearing a long, heavy black dress. Accompanied by two maids, she slowly disappeared into the distance...\nOne of the ladies had brown natural curls.\nThe image of the maid quickly overlapped with the one in front of Klein, and it was abnormally identical!\nKlein's body tensed up, and sweat rolled down his back, but his expression didn't change at all.\nUsing the abilities of a Clown, he pretended like he was recalling the event, and he asked with a smile, \"Were you with that lady on the day of Talim's funeral?\"\nThe maid replied without much thought, \"Yes.\"\n... Damn, it's really her!Klein maintained his smile.\n\"Very well, next question.\"\nAs if nothing had happened, he began to inquire about other things, then he switched to another servant and continued.\nHowever, Klein secretly shortened the process and sped up the progress.\nHe wanted to leave Red Rose Manor before the young lady returned from her riding!\nAt four o'clock in the afternoon, before the sky had turned dark, Klein left the manor much earlier than expected and took the carriage sent by the old butler back to the city.\nSitting in the window with his back against the wall wrapped in silk and muslin, he was relieved to have the energy to reflect on the whole situation-it was Prince Edessak's beloved commoner lady who had cursed Talim...\nWhy did she have to deal with a descendant of a fallen noble family? To take revenge against Talim for trying to break up the relationship between her and the prince?\nBut there's no need for her to do it herself. She can find a chance to mention it while in bed. Prince Edessak has plenty of ways to make Talim disappear without a sound...\nTalim was in a state of deep love before he died. Yes... The first sign was after he successfully persuaded the commoner lady to leave Prince Edessak... They had an affair? So, the commoner lady who was brought back to the manor killed Talim in order to silence him and remove any latent dangers?\nLogically speaking, it makes sense, but the problem is how could a person with a Grade 0 Sealed Artifact or a powerhouse of an equivalent level be restricted by Prince Edessak? Even if the Augustus family is an Angel Family, with the accumulation of enough knowledge, they would still need to use tremendous strength and special methods to be able to restrain someone like that. This isn't something a prince can do...\nBesides, how could such a figure have taken a fancy to Talim?\nWhy does she want to see me all the time? Did she sense that I'm using the gray fog to spy on her?\nNo, if that were the case, I would've been buried with Talim on the day of his funeral... Besides, when she first wanted to see me, I didn't have any blood, hair, or belongings. I hadn't made any divinations yet!\nKlein was puzzled as he thought about it. In the end, he decided to bury the problem deep within his heart. He wasn't to probe or investigate!\nI hope that the Machinery Hivemind, with my earlier reminder, will pay importance to this matter of noticing the royal family's abnormality. Yes, they might regard it with great importance-not because of Prince Edessak's reputation, but for another reason! I hope the royal family continues to prevent the lady from visiting me... After a few days, when the time is right, I'll relinquish this mission, express how powerless I am on this matter, and then use the excuse of going to the south for a holiday, to change my identity and hide for a while!Klein's heart gradually calmed down.\n...\nEvenings in Backlund were always replaced by dark clouds and drizzling rain, and Klein, who felt physically and mentally exhausted, held down his half top hat and walked quickly across the wet street to No. 15 Minsk Street under the illumination of the street lamps.\nAfter resting for a bit and taking advantage of the dark surroundings, he took four steps counterclockwise and went above the gray fog.\nAfter advancing to Sequence 6 Faceless, he had always wanted to check the mysterious space to see if there were any changes. However, as he was too tired last night and couldn't wake up in the middle of the night, he had to wait until he was done being \"busy\" outside.\nIn addition, Klein had to eliminate any interference in order to divine a particular matter.\nThat was, after this advancement, when his spirituality wasn't stable yet, he didn't hear the illusory ravings of \"Hornacis... Flegrea... Hornacis... Flegrea... Hornacis... Flegrea...\" anymore!\nHe wanted to know if this was a natural change after ascending to Sequence 6, or if there was some other reason.\nWithin the majestic palace, the mottled bronze tables and the twenty-two high back chairs with different symbols on their backs stood quietly, as if they had remained unchanged since time immemorial.\nThe same was true for the gray fog below them, as well as the endless emptiness around them.\nBut as soon as Klein entered, his spiritual intuition was keenly aware that the mysterious space was somewhat different from before.\nHe was in no hurry to explore or make any attempts. Calming himself down, he sat at the end of the table, conjured a pen and paper, and wrote a divination statement: \"The reason why I haven't heard any ravings after my advancement.\"\nHolding the piece of paper and muttering the sentence, Klein leaned back in his chair and quickly entered the dreamland with the help of Cogitation.\nIn the dusky sky and land, images flashed, and in the end, they all came to a stop on a particular scene.\nIt was Klein, whose face and body was still covered in pale granules. He was surrounded by an illusory, thin layer of gray fog that was undetectable.\nThe dream shattered. Klein opened his eyes and roughly understood the reason.\nThe gray fog has interwoven with reality, helping me block out the ravings that come from who knows where...\nAfter advancing to Sequence 6, my connection with the mysterious space above the gray fog has become even stronger; thus, bringing about certain changes and allowing me to naturally borrow a portion of its powers?\nFrom the looks of it, that should be the case.\nYes, I should try to explore the area and see if there are any changes.\nKlein slowly stood up and followed his spiritual perception, walking in a certain direction outside the ancient palace. Beneath his feet was the gray fog that spread out like the sea.\nHe finally decided to stop after walking for an unknown period of time. However, when he gave up on exploring, a light suddenly flickered at the end of the path.\nIn his joy, Klein quickened his pace and approached.\nSeven or eight seconds later, he saw a flight of stairs that seemed to lead to heaven!\nThe staircase was formed from pure light. It was holy, transparent, and untainted, capable of shocking anyone's heart.\nThere were only four levels as the staircase reached up into the void, and each level was rather high, as though it was meant for creatures even larger than giants.\nKlein looked up, followed its path, and saw a layer of grayish white fog, condensed and suspended in midair, as though it was supporting something. It was a significant distance from the staircase of light.\nThe four-stepped staircase represents my consumption of the Sequence 9, Sequence 8, Sequence 7, and Sequence 6 potions? What exactly is above that layer of fog?Klein cautiously advanced until he reached the staircase of light and stepped onto it.\nThere was nothing odd about the steps, and they were as solid as stone.\nKlein went up the stairs, climbed up to the fourth level, and then tried to look up at the area above the gray fog. Unfortunately, his vision couldn't penetrate anything.\nHe thought for a moment, then he took two steps forward and jumped up with all his might.\nHowever, the moment he left the staircase of light, he lost his momentum and his Spirit Body's flight instinct. He plummeted straight down and landed on the bottom layer of the gray fog.\nLooks like I need to advance another two to three other Sequences. If Sequence 4 really does result in a qualitative change, then I should be able to see after becoming a demigod...Klein looked up and made a judgment."}
{"num_chp":635,"summary":"The smell of canned wolf-fish is really pungent... Not only is it smelly, but it's also disgusting... It's practically a biological weapon!Klein crouched in the corner and took nearly a minute to recover.\nBefore that very instant, he had underestimated canned wolf-fish. He had failed to take the necessary actions to deal with the situation. He could've used Paper Figurine Substitutes or create an invisible air tube to pretend that he was using Underwater Breathing, but he had done none of that.\nNow, he finally got a deep understanding of how wise it was to ban opening canned wolf-fish in public!\nPhew...Klein exhaled as he slowly stood up. Carrying his suitcase, he slowly walked towards the harbor.\nHis first impression of the city named Nas was one of many white houses, with stone being a common material for the buildings. The second impression was that it wasn't too far north, but the temperature was rather cold. Even though it was already April, it was still only a few degrees Celsius. The third impression was that there were many whaling houses. Gigantic beluga whales were being dismembered for their skin, flesh, fat, bones, and \"gray amber.\"\nThe latter two could be used to make pannier for banquet dresses or top-grade scented materials. Whether it was for incense or perfume, they were considered luxurious goods that only the wealthy and nobles could enjoy.\nAs for the skin, flesh, and fat of beluga whales, they also had their own uses. They were used separately to make clothes, food, or oil-related products. In Nas and the Gargas Archipelago, the culinary methods for preparing beluga whale had transformed into a unique culture. There were all sorts of techniques and famous restaurants.\nKlein passed by the various whaling houses, seeing separated fat being carried out on cargo carriages towards nearby factories that spewed black smoke. They were oil refineries which were very unique to Gargas. Beluga whale fat could be refined into whale oil which could be bottled and made into outstanding incendiary material and the lifeblood of particular industries.\nVery unique...Klein exhaled some mist as he stopped and watched for a while.\nOut of the harbor and into the city district, a cacophony of Feysac inundated his ears.\nHaving mastered ancient Feysac-the source of the Northern Continent's language-Klein was long familiar with the language of the Northern Continent barbarians. He turned his head upon hearing the din and saw the tall populace with slightly blonde hair raising horizontal banners as they protested on the streets.\nThe horizontal banner right at the front clearly wrote the reasons for their protest.\n\"Oppose the poaching of beluga whales! We need sustainable development!\"\nPfft...Klein nearly lost his cool as he believed that the concept of \"sustainable development\" was highly likely to be \"invented\" by Emperor Roselle.\nAs he swept his gaze, he looked at the banners behind it and understood the goals of the protest.\n\"Whaling for survival, not entertainment!\"\n\"Humans aren't more important than beluga whales!\"\n\"Greedy devils should leave Nas!\"\nAt this moment, a policeman dressed in a gray uniform held a shield, riot fork, and baton to stop the protesters from advancing.\nAfter a brief argument, the scene quickly turned violent.\nMany protesting youths threw opened canned wolf-fish, as well as Molotov cocktails. The police didn't show restraint as they forged forward, raising their shields and striking with their batons.\nKlein pinched his nose as he watched the fire burning on the street. He realized that many passersby were completely unfazed. Apart from a small bunch of spectators, the rest continued proceeding to their destinations.\nIt appears that such things happen often in Nas... Do protests develop into riots? As expected of the Feysac Empire...Klein mumbled to himself, circled the street, and casually found an inn to stay.\nHe continued registering as Gehrman Sparrow, unworried that the news released by Vice Admiral Ailment Tracy would cause the Church of the Evernight Goddess to view him as a Faceless. This was because he had no plans on traveling through the whale fishing routes to find mermaids who were believers of the Goddess. He planned on heading to the dangerous region farthest east from the Sonia Sea.\nAs for the safety in the Gargas Archipelago, there was nothing he needed to worry about. This was a colony of the Feysac Empire. The only legal Church was the Church of the God of Combat. They were enemies with the Church of the Evernight Goddess.\nKlein was originally worried that he would encounter many Faceless here, meeting seven or eight Faceless simply from going next door to enjoy some whale cuisine. However, after serious consideration, he rationally eliminated this possibility.\nFirst, Beyonders from the Seer pathway were rare to begin with. Klein had only met three Beyonders who were beyond Sequence 8, and second, Sequence 6 Beyonders weren't commonly seen. Even in a playground for pirates, those who had 5,000-pound bounties were considered rare creatures. Third, once a Faceless had many preparations, they would seek out mermaids on a whaling boat. They would either begin having faith in the Goddess, sink to the bottom of the ocean, or become research personnel. Otherwise, the extremely smart ones would seize the opportunity and successfully advance before leaving safely. It was very rare for them to stay on Gargas Archipelago for long.\nIn all of Nas, excluding myself, there wouldn't be more than two Faceless...Klein straightened his clothes as he wasn't in a rush to contact Admiral of Stars Cattleya. He came onto the streets in a good mood and began searching for delicacies according to what he heard on his travels.\nRaw beluga whale slices, fried whale steak, whale oil with skin, roasted whale meat...Like a standard traveler, Klein restaurant hopped thrice and sampled different food.\nNot bad. It's pretty unique and it's not very fishy. Instead, it's very appetizing and alluring... Burp...Klein covered his mouth as he came onto the streets. He discovered that the street lamps were sparse, but the lights from the houses lining the streets were bright. To a certain extent, they reduced the darkness of the night.\nIce-cold winds passed through the ocean, causing Klein to raise his hand to prop up his collar. The blue cufflinks had their lusters restrained as they were deeply embedded at his wrists.\nCompared to rings, items like cufflinks were more suited to Gehrman Sparrow's persona. Therefore, Klein didn't blame the Artisan for making changes without his permission.\nAs for the harmonica that had fixed the summoning ritual of a spirit world creature, it matched Klein's inward intentions completely. It could be used for a year and a half. It was silver in color, exquisite and beautiful.\nWhen he received the harmonica, Klein had imagined such a scene-a crazy and powerful adventurer playing a sad tune on the harmonica in a silent night under the dark moonlight by the side of a boat.\nUnfortunately, the harmonica couldn't produce any sound, and it could only be used to summon Reinette Tinekerr.\nShaking his head indiscernibly, Klein steadily walked down the empty and cold Nas streets before returning to his inn.\nUsing sleep to bring himself back to an optimal state, he went to Gray Amber Street the next morning and entered a sundry store named Hot Whale Dance.\nUpon seeing the grizzled boss who was a head taller than him, Klein tapped the counter and said in Feysac, \"Whale oil.\"\nThe boss had wrinkles plastered across his face, but he only wore a coat made of beluga whale skin. The light-colored patterns had a strange beauty.\n\"How much?\" The boss was drinking large mouthfuls of liquor, ignoring the messy placement of the goods.\n\"One and a quarter buckets,\" Klein replied according to the predetermined secret password.\nThe boss's drinking actions instantly slowed down as he placed the cup of brownish-green alcohol onto the bar counter.\n\"Do you want to try some? It's many times purer than Nepos. It's considered the mistress of all Feysac men.\"\nThis was a distilled liquor that's a specialty of Feysac. It's brewed with potatoes or grain. The alcohol purity was high, as stimulating and famous as Blaze. Compared to Sonia blood wine, its price was rather low, and it was well-liked by ordinary Feysacians.\n\"There's no need.\" Klein shook his head.\nThe boss chuckled.\n\"What kind of man are you if you don't drink Nepos?\n\"Are there only women in Loen?\"\nHe mumbled before drinking another mouthful.\n\"Who introduced you here?\"\n\"Ma'am Gehrmuses,\" Klein said a name in the style of the local customs.\nThe boss exhaled, causing a strong scent of distilled liquor to linger in the air.\nHe staggered as he got up, like a polar bear performing at a circus.\nAfter giving the store employee instructions, he brought Klein to a tiny room on the second story of the warehouse at the back.\n\"Let me search for it. Let's see...\" the boss mumbled as he crouched.\nKlein controlled the twitching of his facial muscles as he recalled a widely-spread joke in the Loen Kingdom.\n\"When is a Feysac man not drunk? When he's in his mother's womb.\"\nAfter waiting for a moment, Klein saw the boss find a pure crystal ball from his rummaging.\nThen, the tipsy \"polar bear\" had his back facing Klein as he rubbed his hands on it, softly chanting the tongue-twisting ancient Hermes.\nThe room gradually turned dark as all the corners without light sank like they were producing a strange attractive force.\nThe crystal ball quickly lit up, producing the figure of a woman wearing a black, classic robe.\nShe had an oval face and had very fair skin. Her eyes were deep black with a slight purple hue which was filled with mystery.\nI'm seeing another Tarot Club member's actual appearance again...Klein stepped forward and received the crystal ball.\nOn the opposite end of the crystal ball, The Hermit Cattleya could also clearly see The World. He had black hair and brown eyes, with a thin and angular face.\nHer gaze paused for a moment before she hesitantly said, \"Gehrman Sparrow?\"\nShe discovered that the true strength and standards of the Tarot Club members were far stronger than she had expected. The World was actually the crazy hunter, Gehrman Sparrow, who was considered at the level of a pirate admiral!\nMy various assumptions of The World were problematic... Controlled, staid, experienced, and ruthless...Admiral of Stars didn't feel overly surprised.\n\"Yes, Ma'am Cattleya.\" Klein gestured for the boss to leave the room.\nAfter it became extremely quiet, Admiral of Stars Cattleya asked once again, \"I'm very curious. How did you recognize my identity? I've been very careful when participating in the gatherings.\"\nOf course, she had jumped in fright when The World, who had chosen to speak privately with her, immediately greeted her with \"Admiral of Stars.\"\nAnd it was partly because of this that she chose to take on The World's commission.\n\"A secret.\" Klein smiled politely.\nAs he didn't wish for her to make connections to Mr. Fool, he calmly added, \"Your eyes are very special.\"\n\"Can I understand that as a form of praise?\" Cattleya smiled, feeling somewhat enlightened.\nShe believed that The World had previously only relied on her eyes and other details to suspect that she was Admiral of Stars, but she wasn't certain. Hence, he had probed her with language, and her reaction told him the correct answer.\nKlein didn't respond as he switched to asking, \"When can we set off?\""}
{"num_chp":615,"summary":"While Miss Justice was doing the greetings, The Hermit Cattleya maintained her silence as she observed as she did before. She didn't involve herself in matters, as though she was an outsider at this gathering.\nShe watched as Miss Justice and Miss Magician conjured their Roselle diary pages to pay off their previous debts. Then, she carefully glanced at Mr. Fool without daring to look straight at him. Yet, she still wasn't able to see further through the special gray fog. Her dark purple eyes were only capable of seeing clothes that were definitely conjured.\nWith the three pages of Roselle's diary, Klein wasn't in a rush to read it like before. After all, he had already interacted and used a Grade 0 Sealed Artifact and knew what a Uniqueness of a Beyonder pathway looked like. He had even intimidated such a divine artifact, so he believed that regardless of Emperor Roselle's content, there was nothing that could shock him greatly.\nUnless he was given a Demoness Blessing by some powerhouse with a unique ability and temporarily became a woman...Klein joked inwardly as he surveyed the long bronze table in interest.\nEh, Ma'am Hermit's curiosity is different from Miss Justice and company's. She pays great attention to the matter of Roselle's diary?Klein retracted his gaze and took note of this discovery. Then, he casually read the yellowish-brown goatskin.\n\"22nd April. We plan on entering, to explore the Abyss.\"\n\"23rd April. We followed the pitch-black ocean, passed through the liquid-like fog, and arrived at the mountain peak that resembled a monster. Behind it was endless black fog. It seemed to blanket an entire continent.\n\"However, looking at the bottom of the peak makes it seem endless and without limit. I had joked with Edwards that if I were to commit suicide by jumping off that cliff, I might never fall to the ground, forever in a state of falling.\"\nUpon seeing this, Klein nearly pricked up his brows. He couldn't believe that Roselle would dare to organize his own knights and sailors to explore the periphery of the region after seeing the Abyss.\nIsn't he afraid of dying? Legend has it that it's a place that can corrupt everything, causing all life to perish! At this stage, Roselle definitely hadn't reached Sequence 4, and he wasn't a demigod. He was at best a Sequence 5, or even lower... If it were me, I definitely would've turned the boat around and reported it to the Church...In that instant, Klein gained a deep understanding of the huge difference between him and Roselle.\nIn addition, Roselle's description of the Abyss's periphery had reminded Klein of the mysterious stone doors of Amon's mausoleum. A similar scene had appeared after the Church of Steam and Machinery's Archbishop Horamick's puppet made contact with it.\nI wonder what Roselle discovered there... At the very least, he didn't die from his exploration. He still had an exciting life after that...Klein moved his gaze down and read the remaining content on the diary page.\n\"24th April. We proceeded down the peak in an attempt to probe deeper.\n\"The thick black fog is biting cold, as though it can erode flesh and the soul. Haha, luckily, the Dark King I'm onboard has certain items that resist this corruption, or I'll suspect that me and my Knights of the Apocalypse will become members of\u00a0Farron's1Undead Legion.\n\"It's very quiet, and we didn't discover anything.\"\n\"25th April. We saw devils, but they were in the form of rotting corpses.\n\"Behind the black, jagged mountain, below a slush-filled opening that one cannot call a path, there were different devil corpses that were either in normal or unimaginable places.\n\"It was as though they had all been killed at the same moment.\"\n\"26th April. Either corpses or silence; there's no end up ahead.\n\"The items on the Dark King has begun to show signs of corruption.\n\"I've seldom had fear over the past few years, but here, that fear of the unknown is like an invisible hand that clasps my heart tightly.\n\"I have to leave! I have to return! I can't stay here any longer!\"\nWhat happened after this? Emperor Roselle was very successful in escaping the Abyss's periphery, or did he encounter something else? What does the abnormality over there symbolize? An intense battle?Klein subconsciously had some sense of anticipation as he flipped to the second page, only to be let down that it wasn't connected.\n\"8th May. My beloved Bernadette is almost two. The older she grows, the more likable she is. She's indeed a young lady who doesn't let down the excellent genes of her mother and I.\n\"Hearing her clearly call me daddy and seeing her bubbly figure, I suddenly felt a sense of satisfaction.\n\"Ever since I transmigrated to this world, I've done many things. I can say that some aren't honorable, but I've not felt any shame about it, nor have I ever regretted it. On the one hand, this has to do with me finding it very difficult to curb my desires, making it easy for me to be influenced by my environment. Heh heh, I have to thank fate that I've not met a Desire Apostle from the Devil pathway. According to the records, I would definitely succumb to Beyonders of this Sequence. I might even be instantly killed.\n\"On the other hand, I still have a sense of alienation from this world. My parents in this world are very nice to me. I've also worked hard to make them proud, but I know that my feelings for them aren't substantial. Similarly, this is how I treat Matilda. It's more a possessive instinct rather than love.\n\"I have to admit that my mental state is like playing a role-playing game in virtual reality. My parents, brothers, and friends are all non-playable characters. I can devote some of my feelings to them, but never anything serious. Therefore, I can join all kinds of corrupted gatherings without any sense of guilt. I can face people I know well in a cold, ruthless manner. It's just like when I played The Elder Scrolls. I could slaughter an entire village just for a chicken.\n\"But after Bernadette was born, I realized that I had an additional sense of belonging to this world. I was no longer as estranged from it.\n\"This is my child, a living child of mine.\n\"Perhaps this is what so-called maturity is?\"\nWithout children, it's impossible to realize this feeling. No, I don't even have a girlfriend... However, I have to be alert about this state of mind that's mentioned in this entry... It might not exist in the past, but it doesn't mean it wouldn't appear in the future. The higher the Sequence, the greater one's godhood is than their humanity...Klein sighed silently as he flipped to the third diary page.\n\"6th January, a brand new year, a brand new beginning.\n\"After advancing to Artisan, I finally have the powers to do that thing!\n\"That is to create the mysterious silver plate in my memories. There is a high chance that my transmigration was a result of it!\n\"In fact, after I became a Savant, I could already recall its appearance, as well as the strange symbols and patterns on its surface. But the past me could clearly sense that I wasn't able to replicate something like that.\"\n\"9th January. I finally succeeded after repeated failures.\n\"Holding the silver plate filled with special symbols and patterns, I tried hard to inject my spirituality in a bid to activate it.\n\"An endless grayish-white fog seemed to surface before my eyes, but nothing happened.\n\"Is it a problem with the material, or am I lacking certain requisites?\"\n\"10th January. According to my recollections of my transmigration experience, I restored my past state, believing that I no longer lacked anything. However, the mysterious silver plate only showed me the strange gray fog. It wasn't able to help me do anything.\n\"Since this doesn't work, how did I succeed in my transmigration back then?\n\"I temporarily gave up on my attempts, and I destroyed the silver plate I created. Perhaps when I'm a High-Sequence Beyonder and become a demigod, I will have a way to interpret those patterns and symbols to figure out the truth behind my transmigration.\n\"Yes, I'll definitely become a demigod! I'm the protagonist of this era!\"\nGrayish-white fog? The Emperor saw an endless grayish-white fog after replicating the mysterious silver plate from Earth!Klein's eyes suddenly shrank when he read the diary entry.\nThere happened to be an immutable endless gray fog beneath his feet!\nCould it be that our transmigrations have to do with this mysterious space? But why is the Emperor unable to enter, but I can? According to the Emperor's diary entries of the last few stages of his life, he definitely didn't crack the mystery of the silver plate. Otherwise, he wouldn't have not thought of this place when he was in his moment of great despair and mania. He wouldn't have not used this place as his crutch...Klein raised his head as his gaze landed outside the ancient palace.\nHe recalled that deep in this mysterious space, there was a staircase of light that seemed to lead to heaven. It seemed to correspond to his Sequence.\nThe staircase appeared to be built for giants, and its destination was the gray fog which seemed to support something that stood in midair.\nThe secret of our transmigration lies there?Klein made the diary pages in his hand vanish before he leaned back into his chair and said with a normal tone, \"You may begin.\"\nDerrick originally wished to bring forward his request to purchase the Sequence 6 potion formula after Solar High Priest, but Elder Lovia's release made him temporarily abandon his plans. He couldn't wait to mention everything that had happened, wishing to obtain the necessary guidance.\nConsidering how this was still the transaction segment, he held back his desire as he waited in silence.\nThere's something on Little Sun's mind... Something unexpected happened in the City of Silver?Audrey thoughtfully retracted her gaze and similarly didn't request to purchase anything.\nAt this moment, Alger surveyed the area and voiced out.\n\"I need the potion formula of Ocean Songster.\"\nIndeed, he's already a Sequence 6, a Wind-blessed... Isn't he someone from the Church of Storms? Why is he looking for the Ocean Songster's potion formula elsewhere? Obtaining it internally from the Church is a lot easier... He has secrets he wishes to keep from the Church of Storms, or was he just pretending to be someone from the Church of Storms?Cattleya instantly had many theories as she gently took note.\n\"I can help you take note.\"\nUpon noticing The Hermit's response, Alger asked, \"Ma'am, is there anything you need?\n\"I can search for clues ahead of time, so as to trade for the potion formula.\""}
{"num_chp":321,"summary":"In the exhibition hall where Roselle's diary was kept, the two Machinery Hivemind members suddenly heard a clatter.\nAt the same time, they turned their heads to look at the Sealed Artifact made out of blocks above the glass display case.\nInside the scaled down model of the museum's first floor, there was a gray dot that was constantly flashing.\n\"There's a lifeless object in the nearest washroom.\" One of the team members made a definite judgment.\nThe other team member relaxed a little, frowned, and said in a guessing tone, \"A dead leaf blown in by the wind?\"\n\"It's possible.\" The team member who spoke first nodded. \"Let's wait till the security guards pass by, we'll get them to check and confirm the situation. Captain told us to stay here and not to leave no matter what happens, especially not alone.\"\nIn the event of an urgent emergency, they could evacuate with Roselle's notebook.\n\"Alright.\" His companion had no objection to his suggestion.\n...\nIn the office area on the second floor of the museum, Klein was like a floating ghost, passing through one wall after another and flying directly above the restored study.\nHowever, he didn't fly too fast. Instead, he continued to sense the fire spark below and kept track of the distance.\nWhen the straight-line distance reached almost thirty meters, he lifted his illusory and translucent right hand and soundlessly snapped his fingers.\nIn the washroom on the first floor, the box of matches exploded with a soft bang.\nThen, a scarlet flame leaped up and ignited a paper towel, a potted plant, and the wooden door.\nThe flames didn't spread yet, but it was shocking enough.\nThe nearby security personnel who heard the noise immediately rushed over. In the exhibition hall that was monitoring the entire situation on the first floor, the two Machinery Hivemind members also saw the flames in the model at the same time and subconsciously wanted to rush over there. This was not only an attempt to extinguish the fire, but they were also prepared to capture the troublemaker.\nBut the moment they took two steps, they stopped, having remembered their Captain's orders:\nDon't leave this exhibition hall, don't leave Roselle's notebook, regardless of the situation!\nThey looked at each other, then they looked warily at the two entrances to the hall before quietly taking out their own Beyonder weapons.\nAs Beyonders of the Church of the God of Steam and Machinery, they were never lacking in equipment.\n...\nAt this moment, Max Livermore was patrolling the various exhibition halls on the first floor with a lantern in hand. He had also noticed the commotion and, without thinking, rushed towards the direction of the exhibition hall where Roselle's notebook was located.\nThe priority to ensure the safety of the items was higher than capturing the intruder!\nMoreover, Max believed that no matter what the other party's intentions were, as long as they entered the first floor of the museum and entered any of the halls, they would be under the effect of the Sealed Artifact, and it wouldn't be easy to leave that easily!\nIf there was no external help, the infiltrator would be trapped inside!\nEven if the intruder had a helper, it would still take them quite a bit of time to get rid of the effects.\n\"Once you enter, you will be like prey that has fallen into a trap!\" Max Livermore ran at top speed. After passing through many exhibition halls, he finally saw the silhouettes of his two companions.\nAt that moment, Klein, who was on the second floor of the museum, had already passed through the doors and walls according to the layout in his memory. He had arrived right above the restored study.\nHe was in no hurry to carry out any follow-up actions. Instead, he first looked down.\nAs the stone floor was relatively thick, Klein was unable to vaguely confirm if there were any auras or emotions beneath him. He could only spread his arms wide, fall forward, and silently lie on the ground.\nHis illusory and transparent figure quickly faded into the ground.\n...\nOn the crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling on the first floor, a faintly discernible human face suddenly appeared.\nThe strange face overlooked the exhibition hall, its eyes constantly moving, taking in the scenery of every corner in the area.\nThere are no Beyonders or security personnel...Mumbling to himself, Klein penetrated the ceiling and descended in front of Roselle's glass-covered desk.\nHe glanced at it, and without hesitation, he reached out with both hands to grab the bookmark in the manuscript of creativity and the bookmark which looked like child's graffiti.\nHe was trying to prevent a powerful Beyonder, who could reconstruct the scene through magical means, from knowing that he knew which bookmark was abnormal. This was to prevent the investigator from suspecting Miss Justice who had only touched one bookmark.\nAugmented by Azik's copper whistle, he passed through the glass case and steadily held the two bookmarks, then he wrapped them within his spirit body.\nAfter finishing this step, Klein's heart calmed down, no longer having any obvious nervousness or tension.\nHe stretched out his hands again, reaching out for the other bookmarks.\n\"Waaa! Waaa! Waaa!\"\nThe loud and shrill cry of a baby suddenly reverberated within the exhibition hall.\nIt was so illusory, as though it came from far, far away.\nKlein's body stiffened, freezing all of a sudden like a lake encountering extreme coldness.\nIn his spirit body state, he appeared to have been frozen!\n\"Waaa! Waaa! Waaa!\"\nAlong with the cries of the baby were fine black rifts that surrounded Klein like a discontinuous iron fence.\nIn the blink of an eye, one of the black rifts cracked open, revealing an eyeball filled with blood strands. In the center of the eyeball was a deep pupil, and in it, countless tiny white worms were crawling and squirming.\nOne, two, three...Black rifts opened successively, and one by one, the bizarre eyeballs were exposed in midair. They stared at Klein in a cold and merciless manner.\nAs they appeared, everything around them froze in place. Even the illusory spirits were unable to penetrate through them.\nIt even became hard for Klein to sense the existence of the spirit world. He found it difficult to see the translucent figures that were located infinitely high. He found it hard to see the different colors, the lustrous splendors which contained various types of knowledge.\n\"Why did you only take the bookmarks?\" A soft but unemotional female voice entered Klein's ear.\nHe froze on the spot and saw a tall bookcase, divided into two levels. The top level almost reached the ceiling, with a staircase and a passage surrounding countless books.\nAt the top of the stairs sat a figure shrouded by the darkness.\nThe figure's feet, which wore black leather boots, hung from the wooden stairs as they were suspended in midair.\nI actually didn't sense her existence at all... Is she some powerhouse from the Machinery Hivemind? No, she might be a High-Sequence Beyonder!Klein didn't answer; instead, he narrowed his eyes.\n\"Why did you only take the bookmarks? Where did you learn to only take the bookmarks?\"\nThe figure asked once more. The gentleness had a hint of sternness, and the bloodshot eyeballs surrounding him rapidly widened, as though they wanted to occupy the entire space.\nBefore she could finish her sentence, Klein revealed a wide smile on his face.\nHis illusory, nearly translucent figure instantly disappeared, leaving his whereabouts unknown!\nEven Azik's copper whistle and the two bookmarks which were wrapped in his spirit body had vanished!\n...\nAbove the gray fog, within the majestic ancient palace.\nKlein's figure suddenly appeared at the top of the long, mottled table.\nHe leaned back into his chair and said with a chuckle, \"Fortunately, I was prepared.\"\nThe state of his spirit body wasn't part of his Beyonder powers. It didn't originate from the transformation between his physical body and spirit body. This was the result of him summoning himself and responding to his ritual.\nAnd the power of this ritual came from the mysterious space above the gray fog. It stemmed from its special nature!\nHence, as long as Klein succeeded, he wouldn't even need to try to escape. By just ending the summoning directly, he would be able to return to the gray fog and, from here, instantly return to his physical body in the real world!\nAs the space above the gray fog could block the power of deities like the Eternal Blazing Sun and the True Creator, Klein believed that, without the interference of deities, the summoning wouldn't be interrupted!\nAs long as the enemy didn't kill his spirit body or instantly knock him unconscious, Klein had the confidence to escape!\nThis was also the reason why he didn't want to become a spirit body and still make a \"long trek\" over to the museum. The more time spent, added even more variables.\n...\nAs the faint and dark crimson moonlight shone in from the window, the woman sitting at the top of the stairs between the bookshelves looked at the desk in silence. She looked at the spot where Klein had been. The surrounding cries of the baby and the eyeballs had disappeared one after another.\nAfter an unknown period of time, the top of the stairs suddenly became empty, as if no one had ever been there before.\nIn the exhibition hall which housed Roselle's diary, Max Livermore said to his two team members, \"Watch this place well. I'll go find the infiltrator.\n\"He must still be trapped somewhere on the first floor by the power of the Sealed Artifact!\"\nAs he spoke, he looked at the Sealed Artifact, the \"model\" of the first floor of the museum in a bid to find the red dot which represented the infiltrator and lock onto that person's location.\nHowever, no matter how he looked and counted, something didn't seem right.\nThe number of people hadn't increased!\n\"This...\" Max Livermore froze where he was.\n...\n18 King's Avenue, in a certain wealthy merchant's storage room.\nKlein's eyes lit up again, and the corners of his mouth curled up.\nHe left the bookmarks and Azik's copper whistle above the gray fog, and he didn't waste time returning to his body.\nAfter extinguishing the candles and ending the ritual, Klein cleaned up the scene. He used a specially concocted medication to neutralize the smell of the Holy Night Powder and the essential oils from the ritual.\nAfter doing all of this, he dispelled the wall of spirituality, allowing the wind to blow away the remaining traces.\nNext, he took out his Master Key, planning to go through buildings before taking a rental carriage a distance away.\nUsing his cane to determine his direction to prevent himself from getting lost and heading back to the Royal Museum or to a particular cathedral, Klein headed off at a brisk pace, opening the walls and doors that stood in his way with the Master Key.\nAfter walking in a straight line for a while, he suddenly felt like he was unable to determine his position.\nHmm... Two more buildings and I'll be out. If I'm no longer on King's Avenue, I'll get a rental carriage, or I'll make another divination? I'll immediately study the Card of Blasphemy once I'm home!Klein quickly made up his mind. He placed the brass key which was simply shaped against the wall and gently twisted it.\nAs the formless ripples spread out, he arrived at a neighboring building of the terraces.\nAt this moment, his nose twitched as he smelled a strong stench of blood.\nThe strong smell of blood! Klein frowned. He looked up and saw a lady laid out in the living room ahead of him.\nThe woman's expression was filled with pain. There was a large wound at her abdomen, and her internal organs seemed to have disappeared.\nAt the same time, Klein heard grunting noises."}
{"num_chp":572,"summary":"After a series of chores, Klein opened his locked bedroom door and looked into the living room. He saw Danitz sleeping soundly on a reclining chair.\nAlthough he had long heard it, Klein couldn't help but lampoon.\nIt's not even four in the afternoon!\nHas this guy completely let his hair down now that he doesn't need to monitor the radio transceiver?\nWith a thought, he gradually smiled, feeling that this was exactly what he needed.\nThe premise of him maintaining his lucidity in dreams had involved someone invading his consciousness. Typically, his dreams were a turbid mess, which meant that he alone wasn't able to complete the experiment. After all, he couldn't plant a psychological cue on himself.\nTherefore, he planned on using external forces to enter the dreams of others. This way, he could maintain his lucidity like a Nightmare.\nHe originally planned on heading out to find a suitable target, but Danitz's posture was in such a perfect state that he could hardly stop himself from kicking him.\nNo, I should be experimenting...Klein corrected his thoughts.\nHe contemplated for a moment and didn't use a Dream Charm. As a Sequence 7 Pyromaniac, with the ancient name being Fire Mage, Danitz's spiritual perception wasn't to be written off. Once he softly chanted an incantation that could stir the powers of nature, Danitz would definitely be awoken.\nAs such, it would be a question of whether he could evade the matter in a timely fashion.\nAfter some deliberation, Klein took out another thing he had prepared. It was a gem-like object that seemed dark and deep; it was the Beyonder characteristic left behind by a Nightmare.\nIt could be used to a certain extent, just like Nimblewright Master Rosago's All-Black Eye. However, the effects were inferior to one that was from a mystical item. For example, this Nightmare Beyonder characteristic didn't allow Klein to pass through the dreams of someone across the city from his inn's suite, nor was he able to forcefully pull people into a dream. However, it was still simple enough to perform the most basic form of intruding into someone's dream at a close distance.\nKlein held the dark \"gem\" and spread out his spirituality.\nThe illusory darkness rapidly spread before his eyes, filling his vision. Everything before his eyes were blanketed over, including Danitz.\nThere was no longer a humanoid figure but an ellipsoidal blob of light.\nKlein immediately extended his spirituality out and made contact with it.\nWithout any warning, various scenes flooded his surroundings as they flashed rapidly. Finally, it came to stop on a ship that was dozens of meters long. It had a smoke-churning chimney and large sails that were fully raised. The deck was polished abnormally bright, shimmering with the glimmer of a gold coin when sunlight hit it.\nDanitz stood under the main cannon as he had his arms crossed. He was leisurely rushing the sailors, shouting from time to time, \"Scrub that area again!\n\"Dogsh*t, do you wish to copy down the ancient Feysac dictionary?\"\nThis fellow is quite impressive on the Golden Dream...Klein ignored the owner of the dream and flew to the other end of the ship. He found a hidden spot and landed on the deck before preparing to test his spiritual perception.\nWhat he planned on experimenting on was simple. He wanted to know if chanting The Fool's honorific name in a dream was effective. He wanted to know if he could sense someone praying!\nThis way, if Miss Justice encounters danger in the sea of collective subconscious, she can use this method to seek help...After stretching his back, Klein's expression gradually turned solemn as he softly said, \"The Fool that doesn't belong to this era.\n\"The mysterious ruler above the gray fog.\n\"The King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck.\"\n...\nWith the words in Hermes being spoken, he very quickly finished reciting The Fool's honorific name. However, Klein didn't hear the series of illusory pleas.\nIt doesn't work?Klein frowned in thought. He analyzed whether it was really impossible, or if he had made a mistake somewhere.\nYes... Chanting in the dream doesn't actually produce any noise. Relying on Hermes alone isn't sufficient... To achieve the effects of praying, I'll have to use a language like ancient Hermes that can stir the powers of nature. This is the same state as me copying the account password of my anonymous account...Klein nodded slightly and began to chant his honorific name in ancient Hermes.\nHe wasn't afraid that there would be an accident, but that his stirring of the powers of nature would wake Blazing Danitz from his sleep.\nHe recited each word, quickly finishing the three sentences. Following that, Klein heard the stacked series of irritable and illusory pleas.\nAt that moment, Danitz's dream quivered as the Golden Dream quickly disintegrated.\nKlein didn't stay any longer and immediately left. He returned back to his bedroom before Danitz woke up.\nAfter seven to eight seconds, Danitz sat up in a daze as he muttered to himself in fear,Why did I dream of that madman Gehrman Sparrow causing trouble on the Golden Dream...\nWhat a terrifying matter!\nDogsh*t! It must be the result of me worrying over this matter all this time!\nInside the bedroom, Klein had already taken four steps counterclockwise and gone above the gray fog. Without any surprises, he saw a rippling light by The Fool's high-back chair. In it was the scene of him in the dream.\nIt really works. One can still receive a response when chanting The Fool's honorific name in languages such as ancient Hermes or Jotun! It's no wonder some people might suddenly die in their sleep despite not doing a thing. They might be reading some materials or had memorized certain symbols in the day and accidentally replicated them in the dream? The danger in this world really cannot be prevented...Klein dispelled the rippling light and considered if he should inform Miss Justice of the results of the experiment.\nTo only inform her later instead of saying it on the spot is a little damaging to The Fool's image... But Miss Justice is the kind of girl with a huge sense of curiosity. Although she has been warned by Mr. Hanged Man and Admiral of Stars, and even if she's a little more mature now, there's still the chance of her taking risks... Of course, if anything were to happen, it's on herself and it has nothing to do with me...Klein couldn't help but recall Miss Justice's adoration of The Fool and the thought of her optimism and cheerfulness that brought him happiness, as well as her contributions towards the Tarot Club all this time.\nFinally, he sighed and said in a self-deprecating manner, \"I still need to inform her and give a warning.\n\"This is the treatment a VIP gets...\"\nAfter making the decision, Klein didn't hesitate to spread out his spirituality to touch the crimson star representing Miss Justice.\n...\nIn a room of the huge manor in East Chester County.\nAudrey had her legs leaning sideways as she sat before her dressing table. She was recalling the words Mr. Hanged Man and Ma'am Hermit had said.\nAfter being warned by two senior Beyonders, she suddenly realized something. It wasn't that the mid- and upper-echelons of the Psychology Alchemists wasn't aware that one could explore dreams, the icy mountain of the subconscious, and the sea of collective subconscious by using a self-induced psychological cue.\nThe reason why they didn't tell me anything is because it's too dangerous for a Psychiatrist. Many people have already died in such explorations... But they should warn me... Ah, right. From their point of view, I'm only a Sequence 8 Telepathist. I'm not equipped with the powers of a Psychological Cue, so there was no need to warn me...Audrey finally understood the perplexing matter.\nJust as she was about to let Susie enter the room to calm the disappointment in her heart, she suddenly saw thick gray fog spew out, instantly flooding her vision.\nIn the middle of the endless grayish-white, a figure sat in a high-back chair. Looking down at her, it said, \"Do not make attempts without careful consideration.\"\nBefore Audrey realized what was happening, she heard the deep and majestic voice sound out again.\n\"If you encounter dangers in your dreams, you can recite my name.\"\nRecite your name?Audrey's eyes widened as she became overjoyed.\n\"Yes, Mr. Fool.\"\nSeeing that Miss Justice was excited instead of showing any doubts, Klein secretly heaved a sigh of relief and chuckled.\n\"Use ancient Hermes.\"\nWith that said, his figure faded away and the gray fog vanished.\nAudrey sat there stunned for two seconds before hurriedly pursing her lips, afraid that she wasn't on her best behavior.\nMr. Fool actually specially warned me! He even permitted me to recite \"His\" name in my dream!Audrey excitedly took a few steps on the spot, believing that she had really become a Blessed of God.\nOf course, she also remembered Mr. Fool's warning. She planned to understand more from the Psychology Alchemists and make another attempt only when she was sufficiently prepared.\nThe corners of her mouth curled up slightly as she randomly tapped her chest, saying silently, \"May Mr. Fool watch over me~\"\n...\nAbove the gray fog, Klein began to consider another matter.\nRed-haired Helene, who had a reward worth 1,000 pounds, was actually related to Vice Admiral Ailment Tracy!\nTracy took over Qilangos's crew and changed his flagship to the Black Death. As for Qilangos, he previously plundered a tycoon named Jimmy Necker... That tycoon had previously obtained parts of Death's chronicles. It came from a Balam royal family's mausoleum... This information came from that Nightmare inside Creeping Hunger. It should benefit Mr. Azik to a certain extent. I can also investigate the matter in passing...Klein found another reason to look forward to finding red-haired Helene.\nHe originally planned on using the magic mirror, Arrodes, to find her, but now, he planned on mobilizing Sea God believers to perform a search.\nIn the past, it's quite demeaning to send a revelation for just 1,000 pounds. But now that it involves a pirate admiral, it can barely make people guess that there are secret motives behind it...Klein conjured red-haired Helene's photo and summoned the Sea God Scepter.\nHe had never done a mass revelation, so it was possible that it would be a burden that he couldn't withstand.\nHe chose higher-ups like Kalat and Edmonton. With waves reaching high into the sky as a background, he said in a deep voice, \"Find her and protect her.\n\"Be careful of Tracy's forces.\"\nKlein didn't provide further explanations as he broke down this scene along with red-haired Helene's photo into many sets before projecting them into the corresponding dots of light."}
{"num_chp":1183,"summary":"\"...\" Once again, Klein understood why Amon was the God of Mischief.\nAt that moment, he didn't even have the desire to lampoon. All he wanted was to immediately end the historical projection and escape from the Amon-no, Amons-in front of him.\nThe charred corpse that had been \"Parasitized\" wiped the soot from its face. Before Klein disappeared, it said with a smile, \"There's no rush. You are just a projection from the Historical Void. I can't really parasitize you, and you should know very well that I'm not alone. It's difficult for you to launch an effective counterattack.\"\nWith a simple lantern in hand, Klein thought silently. He picked up a piece of the black sculpture fragment that had red insides, and he cautiously asked, \"What exactly do you want to say?\"\nAt that moment, Amon had already changed back into \"His\" appearance. The only problem was that \"His\" skin remained darker.\n\"He\" adjusted \"His\" crystal monocle and chuckled.\n\"You know that I'm aware that you're searching for that Dark Demonic Wolf in an attempt to obtain the Miracle Invoker's Beyonder characteristic from \u2018Him.' I happen to be very interested as well. Why don't we play another game and see who can get to it first?\"\nWhat's the point of that? It's not like I won't pursue it or think of snatching it if I don't play this game. After two seconds of silence, he shook his head.\n\"I refuse.\"\nHe had no intention of listening to what conditions Amon would offer. The more he heard from a top cheat, the more he would suffer.\nAmon shook \"His\" head without a hint of anger.\n\"You'll regret this. I had originally planned to use a Miracle Invoker's Beyonder characteristic to exchange for Sefirah Castle with you, and also give you a period of time to transfer the secret gathering you organized.\n\"And now, I can only consider stealing your fate directly. I will carry the burden of the corrosion from the source. Yes, although it's dangerous, it's still thrilling enough. I'm already prepared to accept it and see who will eventually control the flow. With my father's experience, I believe I won't perform too poorly.\"\n...What? Corrosion from the source? The experience of the ancient sun god? Klein originally didn't wish to continue discussing the topic of the Miracle Invoker Beyonder characteristic and Sefirah Castle, but when he heard that, his heart stirred.\nHe recalled Amon's description and couldn't help but ask, \"The source refers to the Oldest One, the first Creator?\"\nHe desperately wanted to know what sort of unbearable fate Sefirah Castle would bring him.\nAmon pinched the edge of his monocle and looked at him for a few seconds before suddenly smiling.\n\"It's better if I don't answer this question directly, as you won't believe every word I say.\"\nTell me, I'll determine its authenticity! Klein suppressed the urge to blurt out and calmly replied, \"Maybe it's just because you haven't made up the reason yet.\"\nAmon didn't mind at all as \"He\" smiled and said, \"You can think of it that way too.\n\"Heh heh, at times, the truth that you discover for yourself is definitely more agreeable than what others tell you. If you have the time, you can wander around the Forsaken Land of the Gods. This should provide you with more clues. Of course, if you have the guts to enter Chernobyl, then you would know more.\"\n\"...\" Klein didn't pursue the matter any further. After staring at the collapsed cathedral that was bathed in a faint yellow light, he casually said, \"Did the Dark Demonic Wolf hurriedly migrate because of the discovery of your existence?\"\nAmon nodded slightly and said, \"It wasn't just me. \u2018He' also sensed The Hanged Man's gaze. \u2018He' has been hiding in the Forsaken Land of the Gods for thousands of years. \u2018He' is very sensitive to such matters.\"\nA Sequence 2 angel, perhaps even a Sequence 1 angel, can only play hide and seek in the Forsaken Land of the Gods and live such an abject life... Isn't the environment here a little too harsh? Klein sighed inwardly before saying, \"You must've left more than one avatar in the City of Silver. Why didn't you try to stop me from reviving there?\n\"Why didn't you send more powerful avatars over?\"\nAmon nudged the bottom of \"His\" monocle with \"His\" right index finger and laughed.\n\"If that happens, you'll choose to revive in the outside world. This will cause quite a bit of trouble for my follow-up tracking.\n\"And if I-if we were to relax a little, due to the existence of the Miracle Invoker Beyonder characteristic in the Forsaken Land of the Gods, you would most likely be resurrected here. In the following game, the only things that we need to consider are The Hanged Man and Ouroboros.\"\nJust as I thought... Klein said after some thought, \"Even in the same region, as long as you exceed a certain distance, your true body and avatars have no way to instantly merge or switch locations?\n\"Back when you first entered the Forsaken Land of the Gods, you were able to transform back into your true form because the anomalies with Sefirah Castle had similarly interfered with the area here, allowing your true body to sense something. You went to the entrance in advance to wait?\"\nAfter hearing what he said with a smile, Amon asked without answering, \"What's your guess?\n\"Why don't you guess if I've turned back into my original form?\"\nKlein raised his right fist and covered his mouth. After pondering for a few seconds, he revealed a smile.\n\"I guess your other avatars are setting up a corresponding ritual to allow your true body to descend directly...\"\nBefore he could finish his sentence, his figure rapidly turned incorporeal and dissipated.\nThe Historical Void projection was dispelled.\nIn the wilderness outside the ancient city of Nois, the air around the hiding Klein suddenly stirred. In midair, there were a series of illusory monocles.\nThey stared at Klein's figure, as if saying that they had finally found him.\nHowever, Klein's figure rapidly faded away.\nBack when Amon moved the monocle to \"His\" right eye, Klein had already returned from ancient history to the real world. With the help of Paper Angel, he had used Flaming Jump and other Beyonder powers to quickly leave.\nThe reason why his historical projection was able to speak to Amon rather normally was because he was essentially a marionette. It was Qonas Kilgor in the form of Gehrman Sparrow. He had a Worm of Spirit that came from history inside him and was controlled by Klein's projection outside the city.\nMeanwhile, in the process of escaping far away, Klein frequently entered the Historical Void, allowing the projection outside the city to intermittently regain consciousness and maintain control of his marionette.\nThis caused the person who had spoken to Amon to fall into deep thought from time to time. He would either stare with a focused look for a few seconds or seemingly need time to recall what Amon had said.\nAgainst the God of Deceit, Klein didn't dare to be careless!\nAfter leaving Nois City, he circled around two more times and used his true vision to inspect his surroundings above the gray fog. Only then did he slow down.\nThe corrosion that comes from the source... I wonder if Amon is bluffing me... Indeed, I'll have to enter Chernobyl one day to take a look, but I have to become a Miracle Invoker-doing so after I have self-preservation abilities to a certain degree; otherwise, I'll just be knocking on death's door... With the lantern that Danitz had sacrificed, Klein casually proceeded in the dark environment of the weeds.\nThanks to this experience, he finally had a deeper understanding of the danger in the Forsaken Land of the Gods.\nExtremely harsh and warped environment, crazy cultists, fallen angel, groups of Amons wandering about, and Mythical Creatures lurking in the darkness. Somewhere here, there are evil gods watching everything. I can stir remnant divine powers that others can as well... As expected of the Forsaken Land of the Gods. The danger level far exceeds my imagination... As he sighed, he turned his attention back to the Dark Demonic Wolf.\nTo be frank, he didn't think he had any advantage in tracking this Mythical Creature. Be it his understanding of the Forsaken Land of the Gods, or his confidence in the target's situation, he was far inferior to Amon, who had been exploring the area for more than a thousand years, as well as the True Creator's Blesseds who had the benefit of this place being their home ground.\nMy only advantage is that I share the same Seer pathway as the Dark Demonic Wolf. Furthermore, I have Sefirah Castle. There is a strong inclination for Beyonder characteristic convergence. This will have a certain effect on fate and judgment... However, Amon is a King of Angels of a neighboring pathway. There is also the law of Beyonder characteristic convergence between \"Him\" and the Dark Demonic Wolf. The effects won't be any weaker than mine... Klein considered carefully for a moment when he suddenly had an idea. He found his best advantage.\nThe advantage was:\nHe was very weak!\nCompared to Amon, the True Creator's attendant, and the Dark Demonic Wolf, he was very weak!\nUnder normal circumstances, this was a disadvantage, but at times, it was possible that it could bring him something that he wanted.\nMy level is low, and I'm weak. That means that I can become the hunting target of the Dark Demonic Wolf instead... It's very difficult for me to find \"Him,\" so why don't I get \"Him\" to come and find me instead! A Scholar of Yore might not necessarily interest the Dark Demonic Wolf, but if this Scholar of Yore can still trigger Sefirah Castle, that's a whole other matter... I can stir Sefirah Castle from time to time, leaving behind traces of the gray fog's aura as bait for the Dark Demonic Wolf... The more he thought, the more viable he believed it was.\nOf course, this was definitely very dangerous. If he wasn't careful, he might accidentally bait Amon or even the True Creator. And the Dark Demonic Wolf might very likely choose to observe first before suddenly launching an attack and not giving him a chance to prepare.\nBefore taking this approach, I have to make sufficient preparations... There's no need to rush it... Taking a deep breath, Klein reached out his hand and pulled out the black demonic wolf sculpture's fragment that was red on the inside.\nAlthough he had failed to obtain the item due to Amon's obstruction, this didn't stop him from taking it out from the Historical Void. This was because he had already seen it and had touched it. And the item itself wasn't at a high level.\nAt this moment, he wanted to use the fragment to search for the hiding spot of the Dark Demonic Wolf by analyzing it in reverse and figuring out its modus operandi.\nIn the wilderness ruled by darkness, Klein lifted the lantern that emitted a faint yellow light. He got his bearings and changed directions before slowly entering.\n...\nBacklund, Hillston Borough.\nFors, who had gone out \"Traveling\" once, finally received a reply from her teacher, Dorian Gray Abraham."}
{"num_chp":76,"summary":"Bang!\nThe silver bullet traversed the short distance of a few meters and accurately bore into the suited clown's neck. Large amounts of blood spewed out, dyeing his skin and bow tie red.\nThe suited clown was unable to let out a cry as his throat seemed to produce sounds of him gasping for breath. He wished to raise his arm to divert the fatal wound, but his joints appeared to be filled with glue. His motions were slow and jerky.\nBang!\nHaving entered a half-Cogitation state, Klein was not stunned by the appearance of blood. He pulled the trigger once again calmly, as though it was his usual daily practice.\nA grisly hole appeared on the suited clown's forehead as crimson red spewed out. The luster in his eyes dimmed as the intricate revolver's might was far higher than what Klein had imagined to be.\nAs his knees buckled and his arms hung down, the suited clown gradually fell to the ground. His eyes were frozen with a dazed look.\nHis body convulsed a few times before it slowly relaxed and stopped moving.\nHaving delivered a headshot, Klein turned around in a cool manner. He spun his revolver and allowed the empty shells to fall down.\nThen, dressed in his black formal suit and halved top hat, he walked towards Aiur Harson. He pulled out the final silver demon hunting bullet in his pocket and inserted it into the revolver's chamber.\nThe reason why he did not turn back to look at the suited clown's tragic fate was solely because of his discomfort with his first kill. However, it was necessary. He did not know what would happen if the suited clown was under the full control of the puppet.\nFurthermore, he did not dare risk entering Sealed Artifact 2-049's effective range. After all, no one knew if something odd would happen that prevented his self-rescuing luck enhancement ritual to fail.\nAs for the items on the suited clown, Klein only cared if there was the so-called Clown potion formula or the relevant clues. However, this was not something he was in a hurry to carry out. In a while, he could do it together with Dunn, Aiur, and company. If the Nighthawks had it, it also practically meant that he had it. There was no way that they would be unwilling to share the potion formula of Sequence 8. At most, he would be required to accumulate his contributions over time. After all, he had only become a Seer recently; it would still be a long time until he fully digested it.\nAs his thoughts churned, Klein quickly walked next to Aiur Harson. The gentleman in his gray windbreaker struggled to sit up but failed at every try. He was covered in dust and mud from the fall.\n\"Mr. Harson, what do you need me to do?\" he asked, squatting down. He pointed the revolver in his hand at the ground in case of a misfire.\nAiur gasped for air and sighed.\n\"The monster was too strong; if not for its weakness...\"\nThen, he pointed at a sky-blue metal bottle beside him and said in a self-deprecating laugh, \"I was trying to consume some medicine, but my hand shook...\"\nThe sky-blue bottle was about the size of Klein's finger. It was not longer than five centimeters long and a cap that hid spiral patterns had fallen to the side. The liquid had completely spilled.\nKlein reached out to pick up the bottle. As he looked at it with narrowed eyes, he answered helplessly, \"Mr. Harson, there are only a few drops left in the bottle.\"\n\"Go to... Borgia and search his body. In his inner pockets.\" Aiur said as he gasped for breath.\n\"Alright.\" Klein stood up and casually asked, \"Is this restorative medicine?\"\nAn item from mysticism?\n\"No, it only has certain restorative effects. The main goal is to stimulate our minds and squeeze out the potential... of our bodies. It allows to maintain a decent state for a short period of time until we return, where we can receive treatment.\" Aiur attempted to sit up only to fail again. \"It's name is the Goddess's Gaze... Remember to let Borgia drink half a bottle.\"\nKlein did not delay any further as he turned around. He briskly arrived at Borgia who was groaning in pain. He found the uniform sky-blue metal bottle from the Nighthawk's pocket.\nAfter removing the cap, he carefully held the bottle to Borgia's mouth.\nHaving sensed it, Borgia tried hard to open his lips.\nThe bottle was held up as dark red liquid flowed in Borgia's mouth.\nKlein estimated the quantity and stopped just in time. He then screwed the cap back on.\nThe medicine was rather effective. It only took Borgia a few seconds after drinking to regain the spirit in his eyes. Furthermore, he whispered, \"Thank you.\"\nWith that said, he pressed down on the ground as he slowly sat up. He first dealt with his wounds before walking to the unconscious Lorotta and Dunn. Then, he retrieved the Goddess's Gaze from the latter's inner pocket.\nKlein returned to Aiur's side and fed him the remaining half bottle.\nAfter Aiur panted a few times, his actions suddenly became nimbler. He stood up as though he had never been injured.\n\"I'll help Borgia. Help that partner of yours.\" The gentleman with the charm of a middle-aged man pointed at Leonard Mitchell.\nKlein had no objections to it. He turned around and jogged to the \"poet,\" Leonard.\n\"There's no need. I can drink it by myself.\" Leonard, with his disheveled hair, smiled as he raised the sky-blue bottle.\nUpon seeing Leonard agilely get up by pushing up with one hand, Klein, who wanted to lampoon, was suddenly stunned.\nLeonard's injuries are lighter than I expected...\nHe had the ability to consume the medicine from the very beginning!\nThat also means that he could see me walk counterclockwise as I did the luck enhancement ritual!\nNo, that's still alright. I had chanted inwardly and the luck enhancement ritual does not appear odd in any way, or the suited clown would not have fallen for it...\nBut even so, Leonard, who had long recovered but chose to watch by the sidelines, had seen quite a lot. Things like me not being affected by 2-049 and my sneak attack on the suited clown...\nJust as Klein's eyes narrowed slightly, Leonard, who was walking in his direction, stopped beside him and chuckled softly.\n\"I actually wanted to save you but discovered that you didn't need it.\n\"Don't mind it. There are many special people in this world that can always do things others can't, such as you...\"\n\"...and me.\" Leonard smiled as he went past Klein and walked to the awakening Dunn and Lorotta.\nNarcissist...Klein thought silently as he felt a lot more relaxed.\nFrom the looks of it, Leonard Mitchell hid quite a bit of secrets... As he regrouped with the rest while deep in thought, he saw Captain Dunn wear a cloth and pick up the Antigonus family notebook that was covered in yellowish-brown blood stains.\nThe notebook's cover was completely made of thick black paper. It suffused an aura from an ancient and distant time without any signs of softening or rotting. It was nearly identical to the one he saw in his dream. He even suspected that flipping it open would only make him see the Fool wearing splendid headgear.\nHowever, he soon realized that he was overthinking things since Dunn had flipped open the notebook to make a final confirmation.\nKlein was unable to discern the words on it due to his poor angle, but he was certain that there was no drawing of the Fool with his gorgeous clothes and splendid headdress.\n\"Ahem. There's nothing wrong with it.\" Dunn closed the notebook and held it securely. Then, he looked at Aiur and company. \"Let's store this notebook and Sealed Artifact 2-049 behind Tingen's Chanis Gate. We can wait until all of you are recovered or Backlund sends someone over.\"\nUpon hearing that, Klein felt a little disappointed once again, but also felt happy. He wished to see the Antigonus family's notebook once more and figure out the reason for the death of the original Klein, Welch, and Naya. However, he also felt that the ancient item was filled with misfortune. It often brought catastrophe, so he did not dare touch it.\nHanding it to the Church's headquarters and sealing it is considered the best choice...He secretly heaved a sigh of relief.\n\"Alright.\" Aiur Harson, Borgia, and Lorotta nodded in unison. They then turned around and arrived beside Sealed Artifact 2-049.\nThey woke each other up and stuffed the puppet which had resumed moving into the black chest with an opening as they monitored it strictly.\n\"Everything is back to normal.\" Aiur sounded a little more relaxed.\nInside the dimly lit black chest, the puppet wrapped in oil-stained cloth flipped over with its body creaking as it aligned its clown-painted face with the light source.\nOn the creepy face, under the black pupil-less eyes, two hardly noticeable crimson cracks appeared.\nMeanwhile, Dunn, Leonard, and Klein, who had mustered his courage, began searching the suited clown's corpse. They found paper flowers, handkerchiefs, poker cards, glass pieces, and all sorts of strange items.\nHowever, apart from that, he did not seem to carry anything of worth or potential clues.\nHmm, other than the wallet with seventy to eighty pounds and ten plus soli...Klein secretly sighed.\nWith money in mind, he immediately looked down and inspected himself. His face nearly fell literally.\nHis formal suit that cost several pounds had torn in five to six spots which required mending due to his rolling on the ground. Furthermore, it was covered in dust and dirt stains.\nDunn shot him a glance as the corner of his lips curved up.\n\"Losses during a mission can be reimbursed.\"\nReimbursed...Upon hearing the term \"invented\" by Emperor Roselle, Klein instantly felt wonderful.\nYeah. This suit just needs some proper cleaning and mending before it can be worn again. It will still be presentable...\nWhen the reimbursement comes, I can buy another set and I can take turns wearing them!\nHmm, I am not the kind of person that uses a reimbursement for something other than what it was intended for...\nHowever, I should consider getting a set of clothes for combat in the future, such as a black windbreaker like Captain... Clothes with slightly poorer material would be much cheaper than a tuxedo... Tsk, has the reason why the bastard, Leonard, doesn't like wearing formal suits been due to him having such considerations...\n\"Let Frye take care of the dead body. We'll see if he can find what the man originally looked like or find any relevant clues.\" Dunn touched the suited clown's face paint with his gloves.\nThen, they searched the innermost warehouse and saw that there were a splotches of bloody flesh that looked like they had been smashed by boulders. They also saw one white bone after another that had been strewn everywhere.\n\"Ray Bieber was absorbing the power in the notebook via an ancient ritual, just like how we would consume a higher-level Sequence potion. A ritual like that is full of danger. It must be performed in an environment isolated from all disturbances, and the ritual would have required him to enter a deep sleep for a certain amount of time. That was probably why he had yet to leave Tingen.\" Dunn guessed at the possibilities after inspecting the warehouse.\nUpon hearing such a description, Lorotta laughed. Her black hair contrasted sharply with her pale face.\n\"Such a pity, we awakened him ahead of time. His anger at being woken up truly left a deep impression on us.\"\n\"This is a kind of losing control,\" Dunn looked towards Klein and told him, as both an explanation and a lecture.\n\"Why didn't he just leave Tingen and try to absorb it elsewhere?\" asked a perplexed Klein.\nAiur laughed and pointed to his head.\n\"People influenced by ancient or sinister powers often are lacking in this department.\"\nAt that moment, Dunn inhaled and said while hiding his pain, \"Leonard, you are still in good condition. Stay here and do not allow ordinary people to come close... The rest of us will immediately search for items among Ray Bieber's remains. We will return with them and the Sealed Artifact, as well as the Antigonus family's notebook. We will then get Frye, Royale, and the police to come here.\""}
{"num_chp":17,"summary":"\"Blackthorn Security Company.\"\nUpon seeing the signboard, Klein felt surprised yet found it reasonable.\nMan... what do I say about this...He shook his head and laughed before walking up the steps and knocking gently on the half-closed door with his right hand.\nKnock! Knock! Knock!\nThe sound echoed slowly but rhythmically, but there was no response; only a faint sputtering sound could be heard.\nKnock! Knock! Knock!\nKlein repeated, only to be met with the same outcome.\nHe switched to pushing the door, making the gap larger as he stared inside-a classic sofa which might have been for serving guests, a soft fabric armchair, and a burly wood coffee table. There was a girl with brown hair behind a table right across with her head drooped.\nEven though \"Security Company\" is just a guise, isn't this just... just too \"unprofessional?\" How long has this place been out of business? Right, you guys don't need any business...Klein drew closer as he complained silently and knocked on the table just beside the girl's ear.\nKnock! Knock!\nThe brown-haired girl sat up immediately and swiftly took the newspaper in front of her, covering her face.\nTingen City Honest Paper... Nice name...Klein silently read the title of the page facing him.\n\"The steam train service \u2018Soaring Express' that directly reaches Constant City is starting operations today... Oh come on, when will there be one that goes straight to Brindisi Bay. I really don't want to take the ship there again, it's too awful, really awful... Hey, who are you?\" The girl with brown hair read pretentiously and gave her opinion. As she spoke, she lowered the newspaper and revealed her bright forehead and light-brown eyes, looking at Klein with a fawning and startled look.\n\"Hello, I am Klein Moretti, and I am here at the invitation of Dunn Smith,\" Klein said as he took down his hat to his chest and bowed slightly.\nThe brown-haired girl looked to be in her early twenties. She wore a light green, Loen-styled dress. She was set off with beautiful laces on her sleeves, collar, and chest.\n\"The Captain... alright, wait here for a moment. I'll go get him.\" The girl scurried up and went into the room beside her.\nShe didn't even serve a cup of water or anything... The level of service awareness is worrying...Klein smiled faintly as he waited at his spot.\nAfter two to three minutes, the brown-haired girl opened the door and came out. She said with a sweet smile, \"Mr. Moretti, please follow me. The Captain is on watch at the \u2018Chanis Gate' and is unable to leave at the moment.\"\n\"Okay.\" Klein quickly followed behind. In his mind, he pondered to himself.\nChanis Gate, what could that be?\nGoing through the partition, the first thing he saw was a small corridor, with only three offices on each side.\nSome of these offices were locked tight, while some were opened, revealing someone on the inside who typed non-stop on a heavy mechanical typewriter.\nAt a glance, Klein noticed a familiar figure: the young officer that had investigated his apartment, the one with the black hair and blue eye and romantic vibe of a poet.\nHe was not in official wear; his white collared shirt was not tucked in, making for quite an unruly appearance.\nPerhaps he really is a poet...Klein nodded in greeting and was greeted with a smile.\nThe brown-haired girl pushed opened the left office door at the end of the room and pointed inside, chirping, \"We still have to go down a few levels.\"\nThis office had no furniture in place, only a grayish-white stone staircase that extended downwards.\nThe two sides of the stairs were lit up by gas lamps. The stable glow dispelled the darkness and gave a sense of harmony.\nThe brown-haired girl walked in front, staring at her feet while walking carefully.\n\"Although I walk here often, I am still constantly afraid of falling down, tumbling down like a barrel. You don't know, Leonard did such a folly. On the first day of becoming a \u2018Sleepless'-the first day where he had not mastered his new powers-he tried to rush down the flight of stairs. And-and he became a cartwheel. Haha, it was hilarious if you think about it. Oh yes, it was the guy that greeted you just now. This was about three years ago. Speaking of which, I have been with the Nighthawks for five years; I was only seventeen when I joined...\"\nThe girl watched her steps as she spoke. Suddenly, she smacked her forehead and said, \"I forgot to introduce myself! I'm Rozanne. My father was a member of the Nighthawks, who sacrificed himself in an accident five years ago. I suppose we are colleagues from now on- Err, yeah \u2018colleague' is the right word... we are not teammates since we are not Beyonders.\"\n\"I hope to have the honor, but still it depends on what Mr. Smith has to say,\" Klein said as he sized up the enclosed surroundings. He felt that they were going underground-dampness seeped out from the stone walls, dispelling the summer heat.\n\"Don't worry, the fact that you came so far means the Captain has agreed. I've always been a little afraid of him, even though he is amiable, a fatherly figure. I don't know why but I'm still afraid.\" Rozanne spoke as though there was a piece of sweet in her throat.\nKlein answered humorously, \"Isn't being afraid of a father normal?\"\n\"True.\" Rozanne said as she held the wall around the bend.\nAs they spoke, the two finished walking down the stairs and reached a stone-paved floor.\nIt was a long aisle; both sides of the walls were mounted with gas lamps surrounded by metal gratings. Klein and Rozanne's shadows were elongated under the illumination.\nKlein keenly noticed that there was a \"Dark Sacred Emblem\" every few meters-the symbol of the Evernight Goddess. A deep black background dotted with sparkling embellishments, as they clustered precisely half the crimson moon.\nThese emblems did not seem special, but walking between them gave Klein a sense of serenity. Rozanne also stopped talking, unlike her previous talkative state.\nBefore long, an intersection appeared up front. Rozanne briefly introduced,\n\"The path to the left will lead to the Saint Selena Cathedral; to the right are the armory, storeroom, and archives. And straight ahead is the Chanis Gate.\"\nSaint Selena Cathedral? Then, Zouteland Street is just behind Red Moonlight Street?Klein was a little stunned.\nSaint Selena Cathedral of Red Moonlight Street was the headquarters of the Church of the Evernight Goddess in Tingen, a sacred ground where local followers yearned to visit. Along with \"Holy Numerics Cathedral\" of the Church of the God of Steam and Machinery in the suburbs, and the \"River and Sea Cathedral\" of the Church of the Lord of Storms in North Tingen, they sustained the religious circles in Tingen city and its affiliated towns and villages.\nAware that his status made it unsuitable for him to ask more, Klein only listened silently.\nThey passed the intersection and moved straight ahead. In less than a minute, a black iron split gate carved with seven sacred emblems were seen.\nIt stood there, heavy, cold and domineering, like a giant guarding in the darkness.\n\"Chanis Gate.\" Rozanne reminded him and pointed at the room beside them, saying, \"Captain is inside. Go on in by yourself.\"\n\"Alright, thank you.\" Klein replied politely.\nThe room Rozanne was referring to was just in front of \"Chanis Gate.\" The windows were opened, revealing the lit room inside. Klein took a deep breath to calm himself.\nKnock! Knock! Knock!\n\"Come in.\" He heard Dunn Smith's deep and amiable voice.\nKlein opened the unlatched door gently. There was only a table and four chairs inside. Dunn Smith with his high hairline, who was wearing the black coat from the previous night plus a gold watch chain around his chest, was reading the newspaper leisurely.\n\"Come and have a seat. Have you decided? Are you certain you want to join us?\" Dunn smiled and asked as he put down the newspaper.\nKlein removed his hat and bowed, then he sat beside the table and said, \"Yes, I am certain.\"\n\"Then take a look at this deed, heh heh. People like to call it a contract now.\" Dunn pulled out the table drawer and took out two contract copies.\nThere were not many clauses, and most of them had been mentioned by Dunn Smith. The emphasis was on the confidential clause. Violators were tried in the tribunal courts of the Church of the Evernight Goddess instead of the kingdom's courts. It was akin to how soldiers and officers were sent to court martial for trials.\nA five year contract... Two pounds and ten soli for weekly wages, ten soli as compensation for the risk and confidentiality...Klein read through it and answered resolutely, \"I've no problem with it.\"\n\"Then sign it,\" Dunn said as he pointed to the dark red fountain pen and ink.\nKlein used a piece of waste paper to try out the pen before drawing a breath. He signed on both contracts with his name: Klein Moretti.\nAs he did not have a stamp yet, he could only use his thumbprint.\nDunn received the contract, took out a stamp from the drawer, and stamped on the end of the contract and a few key parts.\nWith that done, he stood up and returned a contract with one hand, and reached for Klein with the other saying, \"Welcome, from now on, you are one of us, and please note that the contract is confidential as well.\"\nKlein stood up as well. He received the contract, shook his hand, and said, \"So, I shall be addressing you as Captain?\"\n\"Yes.\" Dunn's grayish eyes seemed especially deep in the dim surroundings.\nAfter shaking hands, they sat down. Klein glanced at the stamp on the contract, it read: \"Nighthawks Squad, Tingen City, Awwa County, Loen Kingdom.\"\n\"I can't believe you guys would use the name \u2018Blackthorn Security Company' as a disguise,\" he laughed and said.\n\"Actually, we have other signboards.\" Dunn pulled out a piece of paper from the drawer.\nIt was stamped with the stamps of the city government and the police department. The content were as follows: \"Seventh Unit, Special Operations Department, Awwa County Police, Loen Kingdom.\"\n\"The first four units are the regular police responsible for general security, like the VIP Protection Unit and Key Installations Protection Unit. And from unit five onwards are the ones dealing with supernatural incidents in each city. Our unit is responsible for incidents related to the followers of Evernight Goddess in Tingen. If there are different types of followers, then we divide the area accordingly; we are mainly in charge of places like the north, west and the Golden Indus region.\"\nDunn briefly introduced, \"Unit Six of the Mandated Punisher squad under the Church of the Lord of Storms is in charge of the pier region, the east, and the south. The university area and the suburbs are under Unit Five, which is the Machinery Hivemind squad in Tingen.\"\n\"Right.\" Klein had no questions about it. He then laughed. \"What happens if someone really comes here due to the \u2018Blackthorn Security Company' signboard and requests for our services?\"\n\"We'll take those requests; why shouldn't we? As long as it doesn't affect our daily operations,\" Dunn said slowly and humorously. \"Any earnings would be considered additional bonuses, so our members are quite willing to take those jobs. Anyway, the market for trivial and troublesome matters such as finding dogs and cats have been monopolized by private detectives.\"\n\"So how many people are there in this Nighthawks squad?\" Klein asked since they were on this topic.\n\"There aren't many supernatural incidents, so there are even fewer Beyonders. There are only six formal members of the Nighthawks in the entire Tingen City, including me. Heh heh, as for civilian staff, there are six including you.\"\nKlein nodded his head, and eventually asked the question that he was most concerned about, \"So, Captain, what do you mean by Beyonders losing control? Why does it happen?\""}
{"num_chp":967,"summary":"Cold winds blew across the platform at night, causing the hanging gas lamps to sway.\nThe light of dusk stretched and shortened from time to time in this scene, allowing the steam locomotive that was silently parked on the tracks to oscillate between being cloaked in shadows or escaping the darkness. It had an indescribable sense of gloom and death.\nAt this moment, a squad of black-and-white checkered policemen entered the platform. Under the lead of the railway company's duty manager, they walked to the huge train that appeared old.\n\"For some reason, after the passengers disembarked, all the train staff, including the train driver, returned to the carriage and never came out again. I s-sent people to look for them and get them out to have some rest, b-but they quickly ran out looking like that had been inflicted with a disease. All they could do was hysterically shout, \u2018they're all dead,' \u2018they're all dead'!\" The railway duty manager in a blue coat held a lamp, walking as he briefed the police about the situation.\nFrom his stammering and trembling body, the police could easily tell the extreme horror in him. It was as though a sudden tap on his shoulder would literally cause him to jump and abandon everything to rush for the exit.\nHis emotions infected the police. All of them held their hands to their waists as they pressed onto their holsters.\nTap. Tap. Tap. The leather shoes hitting the solid, hard ground left reverberating echoes. The police followed the duty manager and warily entered the front carriage.\nInside the carriage, there were two people sitting in each row. They were distributed to the left and right, and they stood away from the windows. At that moment, they were leaning against the backs of their seats, motionless.\nThrough the illumination of the gas lamps outside and lanterns in their hands, the inspectors leading them very quickly recognized the scene before him. Here were the staff of the steam locomotive. They were wearing blue uniforms that differed for men and women, and they were sitting in different seats in silence. Their faces were pale and their eyes wide open. Although there wasn't any sounds of breathing, the corners of their lips were curved up, revealing eight teeth.\nEveryone present felt their hair stand up upon seeing the uniform smiles as they subconsciously held their breaths.\nThis was an extremely bizarre and terrifying scene. All they wished was to turn around and leave, beginning investigations only when it was bright!\nThe leading inspector drew two deep gasps before he instructed the constables beside him:\n\"Go confirm if they a-are dead...\"\nUpon saying that, he glanced at the duty manager.\n\"Follow him and see if there's anyone missing or excess people included.\"\n\"A-alright, Officer,\" the duty manager said with a trembling voice.\nAs he and the constables ventured deeper into the carriage, the other policemen drew their revolvers and remained on high alert.\nIn an unbearable silence, time slowly ticked by until, finally, one of the constables stopped at the end of the carriage, turned around, and shouted, \"It's confirmed. All of them are dead!\"\nThe railway manager stuttered immediately after him, \"There are two missing. The train driver and the train conductor...\"\nThe inspector calmed down significantly when he realized that nothing had happened all this time. he thought and said to all the constables, \"Maintain the corpses' present state and await an autopsy.\n\"Meanwhile, split into two teams. One team is to head to the other carriages to search for the train conductor and driver while the other team is to check the scene for clues and relevant information. Once the sun rises, we will begin investigations starting with the train personnel and the passengers who were previously on board. We will search for any commonalities and peculiarities.\"\nAlthough many passengers didn't present their identification documents when purchasing tickets, the inspector believed that it was possible to find people who had registered themselves and learn from them of any abnormalities on the train or passengers worth paying attention to.\nJust as he said that, a biting cold wind stirred, blowing through the carriage.\nWhen all of this came to an end, the inspector was about to emphasize his orders when he suddenly noticed something amiss.\nThe steam locomotive staff members who were in their seats still had their eyes open with their whites showing and their faces pale. However, their mouths had closed at some point in time and were no longer showing their eight teeth.\nInside a luxurious hotel room, the wall lamps shone brightly onto the carpeted region where a desk stood.\nKlein had transformed into Gehrman Sparrow and was sitting on a single-seater. He had his left leg crossed over his right.\nBeside him was Enzo who looked like a native. In front of him stood a row of cultist marionettes.\nThey were the people involved in attempting to make a sacrifice on the steam locomotive-the man with the lumpy cheek, the train conductor and the train driver.\nThey had circled from different streets donning different looks to gather here.\n\"Who made you do the sacrifice?\" Klein asked in a deep voice.\nAfter advancing to Sequence 4 and becoming a Bizarro Sorcerer, not only was he able to read the thoughts of his marionette's superficial consciousness, he could also use the increased control of Spirit Body Threads to do things similar to spirit channeling.\nOf course, the higher the level of the marionette, the poorer the effects of the spirit channeling.\nAfter a brief silence, the conductor who was clearly Loen with rather thick body hair said blankly, \"It's a revelation from God.\"\n\"Which god?\" Klein received the porcelain teacup from Enzo and took a sip.\nThe train conductor replied in a daze, \"God is God. There are no others.\"\nKlein lowered his cup and asked, \"How did \u2018He' reveal \u2018His' revelation? What was said exactly?\"\nThe conductor instantly turned reverent.\n\"He' gave a revelation through a divine item, requesting us to sacrifice many lives to pleasure \u2018Him.' In return, \u2018He' will give us eternal life in \u2018His' kingdom.\"\nSacrifice many lives... Compared to the Numinous Episcopate, the Rose School of Thought prefers doing such things. They have always been infamous for blood sacrifices... But to have eternal life in God's kingdom is closer to the Numinous Episcopate's beliefs. Of course, I can't eliminate the possibility that it was fabricated... Klein pondered for a moment and asked, \"What divine item?\"\nThe train driver didn't reply as he glanced at the man with the red, lumpy cheek.\nThe man then took out an item from an inner pocket.\nIt was a cloth doll of shabby craftsmanship with curved eyes and mouth.\n\"God will issue us commands at a specific time through it. I bought it at a flea market,\" the man with the lumpy cheek said slowly without any perturbation in his tone.\nThis... Klein instantly thought of many possibilities before getting Enzo to take the cloth doll and scrutinize it carefully, but he didn't discover anything odd.\nWith his experience, this meant that the problem wasn't with the doll. That meant that there were two possibilities: First, someone was using the doll as a decoy while acting as a deity nearby. Second, it was a truly secret existence who had specially labeled the item to send a revelation.\nIf it's the former, the train attendants' death would've been discovered, and preparations would've been made... If it's the latter, perhaps nothing has been detected... Klein contemplated for a moment and made Enzo place the cloth door on the desk in front of the window.\nHe then stood up and instantly transformed into another train attendant and stood with the row of cultists.\nSimilar changes happened when Enzo returned.\nAfter an unknown period of time, the night grew deeper.\nSuddenly, on the desk bathed in crimson moonlight, the cloth doll with curved eyes and mouth moved its limbs and slowly stood up."}
{"num_chp":105,"summary":"Klein twisted open the golden bottle's cap and brought it to his nose. He took a whiff of the stimulating scent that energized him.\nThis was Holy Night Powder made using Slumber flowers, Dragon Blood grass, deep red sandalwood, mint, and other herbs. Since it was simple to concoct, Klein had made a batch the moment he got the ingredients from the underground market. It was going to be of use now.\nHe poured a little of the Holy Night Powder on his palm and collected himself. His irises turned dark.\nNext, Klein put away the metal bottle and scattered the powder onto the ground after infusing his spirituality into it.\nHe scattered the powder as he walked, forming a circle around Sirius's corpse.\nA formless barrier rose, separating them from the outside world.\nKlein flicked away the remaining Holy Night Powder on his hand and took out the other metal bottles. He sprinkled the Amantha pure dew and other liquids in the surrounding area.\nThe ritual he set up was different from the one Old Neil used at Ray Bieber's house since the aim of the ritual was different.\nFor example, Old Neil poured the liquids before using the Holy Night Powder. That could create a serene and holy state second only to an actual altar. Klein had used the Holy Night Powder first before pouring the liquids to prevent Sirius's remnant spirituality from being disturbed by the surrounding objects while still barely managing to have an environment that satisfied the requirements of the ritual.\nIf he had used Old Neil's method, the rest of Sirius's spirituality would've been purged, making it impossible to establish a connection.\nAfter finishing his preparations, Klein put away the materials and entered a state of Cogitation. He recited the Hermes incantations softly, \"I pray for the power of the dark night.\n\"I pray for the power of the mystery.\n\"I pray for the Goddess' loving grace.\n\"I pray that you'll allow me to communicate with the heretic's spirituality inside this altar.\"\n...\nAs the incantations reverberated throughout the sealed space, Klein suddenly felt a massive, terrifying, and mysterious energy descend upon him.\nHis eyes turned completely black as though he had lost his pupils and the whites of his eyes.\nSeizing the opportunity, Klein recited a divination statement in his heart, \"The formula to the Clown potion.\n\"The formula to the Clown potion.\"\n...\nAs he was reciting the statement, he used Cogitation to temporarily enter a dreamlike state.\nIt was a hazy gray world without a sky or ground. Klein was unusually alert as he observed a transparent, ethereal figure.\nHe extended his right hand and touched the remnants of Sirius's spirit.\nThe scene in front of him changed with a rumble.\nIt was a study table painted with dark red paint. There were three candles on a silver candle stand, as well as a blank piece of paper.\nSirius had a pen in his hand. He wrote in Loen language, \"This is the second formula, its name in the notebook is \u2018Clown.'\"\n\"80 milliliters of pure water, 5 drops of tornapple juice, 7 grams of black-rimmed sunflower powder, 10 grams of golden cloak grass powder, 3 drops of poison hemlock. These are the supplementary ingredients.\"\n\"The main supernatural ingredients are: one crystal of the single horn of a matured Hornacis gray mountain goat and a complete stalk of a human-faced rose.\"\nSirius seemed to have the Clown potion's formula memorized as he quickly finished writing it.\nHe paused for a moment and took a sip of coffee, then he unwound the silver pendulum around his wrist.\nHe held the pendulum and closed his eyes, muttering terms to himself such as \"the end of days\", \"peace of mind\", \"hope for the Lord's blessings\", and \"confess\".\nAfter Sirius finished his prayer, Klein finally saw the pendulum clearly.\nUnder the wound silver chain was a thumb-sized human figurine.\nThe figurine had a single eye, a trait unique to giants. It was facing down, its legs bound by chains that connected upwards.\nAt that moment, the single eye of the giant suddenly had a faint red glow.\nCrack!\nThe scene Klein witnessed shattered as his legs buckled, almost causing him to kneel to the ground.\nKlein felt pain in his head as though he had been struck ruthlessly in the head with a bat. His vision turned blood-red as his hands involuntarily reached out to protect his knees.\nHe recovered several seconds later and stood back up. He felt that his spirituality was unusually weak, as if he had heard the murmurings that penetrated his mind once again.\nBut due to his progress in \u2018digesting' the magic medicine, the adverse reaction calmed down quickly.\nThe Hanged Giant, the True Creator... Sirius and Hanass were both members of the Aurora Order? But the Captain saw a huge cross in Hanass' dream. The terrifying being crucified on the cross wasn't the Aurora Order's Hanged Giant...Klein took two deep breaths and waited for his spirituality to slowly recover.\nThe Aurora Order was a secret organization that sprang into existence about two to three hundred years ago. They worshiped the True Creator and symbolized him with The Hanged Giant. They believed that every human being had divine qualities, and as long as they persevered and made it through the countless trials, they would be able to accumulate enough divine qualities to become angels.\nAccording to the internal records of the Nighthawks, the Sequence 9 of the Aurora Order was Secrets Suppliant. These Beyonders could sense the existence of mysterious and horrifying beings and were armed with a decent amount of knowledge regarding sacrifices and some knowledge on ritualistic magic. There was enough evidence to claim that senior Secrets Suppliants experienced distortions of their worldview and lost control easily.\nLittle was known about the Sequence 7 which the Aurora Order had grasped. Sequence 8 was Listener. This was considered quite a terrifying \u2018job' for a Beyonder.\nEvery Listener could listen directly to the whispers of the secret entities; thus, they frequently came into contact with powerful, distorted, unique abilities. But consequently, if they were unable to advance, it was difficult for them to survive the next five years after becoming a Listener. Furthermore, the comments the Nighthawks had in the reports were that every Listener was a lunatic. Even if they looked normal on the surface, they were always crazy on the inside.\nThe details of the report regarding the Aurora Order flashed through Klein's mind. His initial theory was that Sirius was a Secrets Suppliant.\nFrom the description, Secrets Suppliant are as hopeless as Seers in battle. That does fit Sirius's actions just now. What happened later was a loss of control brought about by the injury? Yes, Frye once said that every Beyonder would more or less undergo some weird changes after they die...Klein thought as he tapped four points on his chest to praise the Goddess.\nAfter his spirituality recovered slightly, he concluded the ritual with the appropriate procedure and dismantled the wall of spirituality.\nWith a whoosh, a gust of wind blew as Klein forced himself to look at Sirius's corpse.\nHe noticed that there was still an obvious wart on Sirius's mangled face. It was a dark purple wart, almost black. There seemed to be liquid and a light gleaming within.\n\"What kind of transformation was that?\" Klein rubbed his temples, not daring to touch it.\nHe bent over and retrieved his cane, allowing it to bear his weight.\nAfter what had just happened, he knew that Sirius's spirituality had been completely destroyed. Even the Spirit Medium Daly would be unable to communicate with him.\nAfter a while, Klein saw Captain Dunn and his partners, Leonard and Kenley.\n\"It seems like your fate is tied to Beyonders and evil forces. In just a few weeks, you have come across more supernatural incidents than what we usually see in months,\" Leonard joked, looking at the corpse on the ground.\n\"It might not be a coincidence,\" Klein added, as he suddenly thought about the red chimney he had seen in his dream divination, as well as the majestic palace on the main peak of the Hornacis mountain range and the formless focus on him. He took the opportunity to mention it in passing.\nDunn surveyed the surroundings and, with his gray eyes trained on Klein, asked, \"You tried channeling his spirit?\"\nThere were still traces of Holy Night Powder and the scent of the essential oils.\n\"Yes,\" Klein replied truthfully. \"I was worried that you would arrive late and that the remains of his spirituality would scatter.\"\n\"You don't look well. Are you alright?\" the short Kenley asked in concern.\nKlein passed Sirius's undelivered letter to the captain and began from the beginning.\n\"When I went to the underground market to purchase materials for the rituals, I suddenly remembered that Selena had also once gone to the Evil Dragon Bar and that it was Hanass Vincent that brought her there. This meant that Hanass was a regular there. Thus, I suspected that the person in the portrait, someone who's definitely connected to Hanass, might have gone to the underground market too.\n\"I asked the boss Swain about the portrait, and he gave me confirmation. He told me that the man had once tried to buy documents and items related to the Hornacis Mountains. That reminded me of the library. I recalled that the librarian had mentioned that someone had just returned the journal issue I wanted to borrow...\"\nLeonard stood to the side, listening with a smile. He suddenly interrupted, \"And so you brought your identification documents and badge here to flip through the borrowing records? Actually, I am very curious; why would you come into conflict with this man here? Even if it was a direct encounter, with your style of doing things, you would've pretended that you didn't know him and would just leave the library. Then you would come to Zouteland Street to ask for our help.\"\n\"Yes, there was no need for you to take the risk. As long as you confirm the target and that he hasn't left Tingen, there would always be a way to find him,\" Dunn added as he reviewed the letter.\nKlein immediately said in embarrassment, \"The librarian recognized him and shouted for the police to help.\n\"There's no way I could have pretended not to hear that...\"\nLeonard and Kenley looked at each other. One tried to cover his amusement, while the other turned his head to the side.\nDunn nodded, his gaze leaving the letters.\n\"Did you get anything from channeling his spirit?\"\n\"I saw a pendulum that took the shape of a Hanged Giant. I saw a blood-red glow flash in the giant's only eye before I was forced out of the ritual,\" Klein described honestly.\nHe didn't want to talk about the Clown potion for the time being as he had two considerations.\nFirst, if Dunn and the rest were able to find Sirius's hideout and the corresponding records, then it would make no difference if he told them or not, as there would be no additional contributions attributed to him.\nSecond, if Dunn and the rest were unable to find it, he could report it in the future. This way, he would be awarded with another contribution, allowing him to acquire the ingredients needed to concoct a potion. This was a way to obtain double the rewards for a single task, a technique that stemmed from Old Neil's recent teachings.\n\"Aurora Order?\" Dunn muttered to himself before he asked some relevant questions.\nAfter Klein answered all his questions, he saw the fatigue in Klein's eyes and waved his cane.\n\"Not bad. You foiled a scheme that was targeting Tingen. You can go back and rest. Kenley, bring Old Neil over.\"\nAfter giving out instructions, Dunn smiled bitterly and shook his head.\n\"Before Sequence 6, Beyonders of the Sleepless pathway lack many supplemental abilities. We can only conduct the simplest of ritualistic magic.\"\n\"Captain, you mean that from Sequence 6 onwards, a Sleepless pathway Beyonder would gain improvements in the corresponding aspects?\" Klein asked out of curiosity.\n\"Yes,\" Dunn confirmed.\n...\nAfter leaving the Daffodil Street Library, Klein nearly fell asleep in the carriage on multiple occasions on his way back to Daffodil Street.\nHe lumbered into the house, he then removed his hat and jacket before falling asleep on the sofa.\nSometime later, he woke up abruptly, took out his pocket watch, and snapped it open.\n\"Melissa will be back in half an hour, Benson in forty-five minutes... If I don't get up, I'll have to make them wait an hour before we can have dinner...\" Klein rubbed his forehead as he entered the kitchen.\nHe washed his face with cold water, then took out the oxtail, tomatoes, carrots, and onions he had bought that afternoon.\nAfter he prepared the ingredients, he suddenly froze. He had the feeling that his actions just now formed a strange juxtaposition with the incident that afternoon.\n\"I am a man who just saved Tingen...\" Klein mumbled in amusement. He put on a white apron and got to making dinner."}
{"num_chp":731,"summary":"Illusory black threads emanated out of Senor's body and entered Klein's hands. With every jolt in spirituality, it gave a different reaction.\nIn fact, there was no need to use both hands when controlling the Spirit Body Threads. Klein was just accustomed to doing so, as it gave him a feeling like he was truly controlling a puppet.\nFrom the looks of it, other Marionettists can discover each other's marionettes. The Senor's abnormality can't be hidden from their eyes, so I have to be careful about this.Klein concluded the problems he discovered, and he quickly turned his thoughts back onto Senor.\nThis Admiral of Blood was dead. His Spirit Body had become a vessel for the marionette, losing any traits that belonged to him. Therefore, many divination methods were ineffective against him.\nOf course, methods to seek his corpse were still effective. Klein planned on \"cleansing\" the Wraith in the gray fog before using Paper Angels to envelop the mirror-like objects that he had possessed before placing him into a cigar case that was sealed by a wall of spirituality, along with Azik's copper whistle. This created a 3-layered interference effect.\nThis way, Klein believed that, even if the Rose School of Thought angel wished to, it was impossible to use divination to lock onto his position via Admiral of Blood.\nAs for whether the Mother Tree of Desire had left any \"backdoors\" in Senor's body, he wasn't too worried. This was because if that really happened, \"She\" could've mutated Senor during the demigod battle royale in order to deal with him. Based on the situation back then, there was a guaranteed chance of success.\nMother Tree of Desire, or should I say, the Chained God, strictly controls its organization's members. It relies on a vow contract and other methods that are ingrained into the soul. This can be inferred from Miss Sharron's descriptions and my interaction with the corresponding characteristics...\nAs long as I don't attempt to use Admiral of Blood to divine the secrets of the Rose School of Thought or the potion formula of the Mutant pathway, I wouldn't trigger any problems. The Werewolf Beyonder characteristic has remained normal despite being above the gray fog for so long...\nBesides, there's still the gray fog \"cleansing\" process. If there are any latent problems, it should be washed out...Klein thought for a while and took out Azik's copper whistle from inside his body.\nHe turned his right wrist and made the side with fewer patterns appear under the sunlight, making it reflect the light.\nImmediately, the copper whistle had Senor's figure appear on it as it rapidly turned clear.\nThe Admiral of Blood in front of Klein suddenly vanished as a result.\nPerhaps the Mother Tree of Desire can use the vow contract and other methods to vaguely lock on, but that doesn't matter. \"She\" can sense the gray fog's unique trait on me anyway, and \"She\" will sense me once I'm within range... Besides, this marionette might be destroyed at anytime when I use it as a shield...Klein was like a jobless tramp who was debt-laden. He felt that there was almost nothing he was afraid of.\nOf course, he really was debt-ridden.\nAs long as I advance to a demigod and can hide my unique trait, it's fine losing marionettes...Klein surveyed the area as he bent his back to pick up the silver necklace. He took four steps counterclockwise while chanting the incantation softly.\nThis time, he hadn't entered via summoning his Spirit Body, so he couldn't directly return.\nThe grayish-white fog was quickly emanated as hysterical ravings and roars echoed for an eternity. Azik's copper whistle didn't react abnormally, which meant that there weren't any latent problems with Admiral of Blood.\nSitting at the end of the bronze table, Klein placed Azik's copper whistle in front of him, making Senor, who was dressed in a dark red coat and old triangular hat, appear. He was like a butler awaiting orders from his master.\n\"Do you have any other items on you?\" Klein asked, as though Admiral of Blood was still alive.\nThis was his attempt to act as a Marionettist!\nFollowing that, he controlled Senor, made him rummage through every pocket as he subsequently took out 325 pounds, 16 soli, and 8 pence in cash. There were also 13 gold coins.\nApart from that, perhaps due to his frequent act of transforming into a Wraith state, Senor didn't carry anything else on him.\nHow poor... As a pirate admiral, you don't even have a single mystical item? Did you hand it over to the Rose School of Thought or your subordinates?Klein seriously considered cashing out Admiral of Blood via the black market.\nJust in Loen alone, he was worth 42,000 pounds!\nYes, claiming the bounty from Loen isn't pragmatic. Be it the Church of Storms and the kingdom's military, they will follow the clues to capture Gehrman Sparrow, who managed to embroil so many demigods in a battle royale, and then investigate the organization backing him. They wouldn't even pay, and they might even plant a trap...\nBy the same logic, the Churches and governments of other countries must have similar ideas. However, they might be easier to work with. Retrieving the bounty will require substantial risks...\nBesides, there's no rush. I'll send Senor out when I plan on switching marionettes. After all, being a marionette for a few days won't change his identity or value...Klein reined in his thoughts and cast his gaze on the silver necklace with an ancient coin attached to it.\nHe immediately used divination to gain the gist of its origins and usage.\nIt came from a Sequence 5 Winner from the Life School of Thought. After dying at the hands of a Rose School of Thought demigod, this gentleman's Beyonder characteristic and psyche fused with an ordinary silver necklace that he carried with him, turning into a mystical item.\nAs for the reason why the ordinary silver necklace would be carried by a Sequence 5 powerhouse for extended periods of time, Klein was unable to receive any effective revelations from it, as it had been too long and it had been corrupted.\nThe mystical item had two uses. One was to passively make the wearer lucky. In their daily lifestyle, the owner would encounter good things, easily succeeding in whatever they did. When suffering a lethal blow or terrifying disaster, ridiculous scenes would happen, allowing them to be successfully rescued. The latter situation only lasted for ten minutes.\nThe second use was to actively give an enemy bad luck, making the target unlucky. Be it in daily life or combat, it was easy for them to experience failure due to some trivial problem.\nThe corresponding negative effects of the necklace was the Conservation of Luck. After being lucky, they would immediately meet with repeated bad luck. They would be as unlucky as they were lucky before. It needed the wearer to be devoted and seriously avoid any danger; otherwise, it was very easy for them to die in a comedic manner, and even harm people around them.\nThe luck received in one's daily life would often revert back after a month. The user would end up unlucky regardless of whether they wore it or not. However, such bad luck was slowly released, so it wasn't too dangerous.\nAnd luck obtained in combat would similarly strike back ten minutes later in a similar vigor.\nOverall, this is a rather good mystical item, but I don't have much use for it. After all, Fate Councilor Ricciardo was unable to change my luck... Hmm, I'll just wear it on me for now. It has few negative effects on me. I'll sell it if there's a chance to pay off my debt with Miss Messenger... Miss Messenger wants gold coins, while I have gold pounds. It's nearly impossible to exchange 10,000 gold coins through the banks or official markets. From the looks of it, I'll have to do it in batches, getting each Tarot Club member to change some of it...Klein soon decided on a plan as he casually came up with a name for the necklace:\nScales of Luck!\nFollowing that, he cast his gaze onto Senor, who was standing reverently to his side. He began to study the powers a Wraith had.\nForceful possession, Enemy Control, Wraith's Shriek, Mirror Blink, Obstacle Penetration, death-related spells, and Invisibility that wouldn't be discovered by most Mid- and Low-Sequence Beyonders...Klein distinguished each power, and he matched them with Sharron's and Maric's description, as well as his experience gained from combat.\nHe soon concluded this, afraid that the candle in the outside world would finish burning. And a dark cave was extremely bad for the present him who had a phobia of the dark.\nKlein immediately took out a paper figurine from the junk pile, and together with the Black Emperor card, he stirred some of the powers above the gray fog, turning it into an anti-divination \"angel.\"\nThis angel rapidly spread its wings and wrapped around a gold coin. On its reflective side was Senor's figure.\nThen, Klein brought the gold coin, Azik's copper whistle, Death Knell, and his suitcase back to the real world. As for Creeping Hunger and Groselle's Travels, one of them hadn't been fed, and the other might cause Klein to be swallowed into the book for carrying it for too long. Therefore, they were left in the junk pile above the gray fog.\nHaving returned to the cave, Klein hurriedly placed the gold coin and Azik's copper whistle into a cigar case before sealing it with a wall of spirituality.\nHe cleaned up the scene, switched into formal clothes, and carried his suitcase. He followed the beach until he came to a residential area. He discovered that he was near Pritz Harbor.\nHe didn't immediately return to Backlund. Instead, he changed his appearance, took a steam locomotive, and headed for Conant City in Desi Bay. He planned on circling the area once before changing his identity again.\n...\nBansy Harbor.\nAlger Wilson looked at the destroyed city under the afternoon sun.\nHe saw that the buildings had completely collapsed, and there were deep chasms in the ground and charred spots everywhere.\nSuch a scene extended into the depths of the island. Even the mountain had collapsed.\nAt that moment, there wasn't anyone from the Church of Storms watching the ruins, since there wasn't anything here. And the plans to rebuild the harbor wasn't brought forward at all.\nAlger jumped off the Blue Avenger and circled the ruins with his sailors, but they didn't discover anything of value.\n\"Let's go,\" he instructed with a staid attitude.\nHe soon boarded the ship which hoisted its sails and left the island.\nAfter an unknown period of time, a figure suddenly walked out from the depths of the ruins.\nHe wore a double-breasted, pure black clerical robe. He had dark golden hair, and his facial features were clear and distinct, like an ancient, classical sculpture.\nHis eyes were dark blue, nearing black. They looked lusterless, but they were filled with dense blood capillaries."}
{"num_chp":920,"summary":"Chapter 920 Calder\u00f3n's Origins\nBayam, the slums.\nHooded with a mask underneath it, The Hanged Man Alger once again met with Admiral of Stars Cattleya.\nAt a table, the two of them sat across each other, facing each other without saying a word.\nFinally, Cattleya said, \"Have you heard the news?\"\nAlger didn't directly answer as he returned with a question:\n\"The one about Gehrman Sparrow?\"\nCattleya fell silent for a few seconds and nodded.\n\"He has turned Admiral Hell into his marionette.\"\nBe it Admiral of Blood from before or the present Admiral Hell, they were both pirates who had a higher bounty than her. No matter how confident she was of herself, she didn't believe that the two Sequence 5 elites were weaker than her!\n\"You learned of it earlier than I expected.\" Alger confirmed the authenticity of the news in a tactful manner.\nBeing a member of the Church of Storms which controlled a large region of the sea, he could directly obtain the latest news from the official channels.\nCattleya curled her lips and said, \"If the Future were at sea, I might have to take days or even weeks to receive it. But I've been in Bayam recently.\"\nShe didn't divulge her intel source.\nAfter a pause, Admiral of Stars asked frankly, \"What else do you know about this matter?\"\nAlger shook his head.\n\"I was trying to figure out the exact situation when I saw your signal, so I rushed here to meet you.\"\nCattleya nodded slightly.\n\"Gehrman Sparrow and Admiral Hell didn't engage in a battle. Ludwell didn't resist, because Gehrman Sparrow had boarded the Black Tulip with a man who was addressed as Death Consul.\"\nDeath Consul... Alger's pupils dilated as he felt an indescribable pressure.\nSuch a term wasn't something any random demigod could undertake!\nFurthermore, that wasn't something the man flaunted himself, but an honorific term that Admiral Hell Ludwell had used. Furthermore, he gave up resistance and was willing to lose his life!\nWith The Hanged Man not saying a word, Cattleya added, \"In the Death pathway, Death Consul is the name of the Sequence 2. Of course, every emperor of the Balam Empire was also given this title.\"\nIndeed, an angel, an angel from the Death domain... Alger automatically ignored the latter possibility. After all, based on the \"acting method,\" the position of emperor was definitely held by a Sequence 2 angel before the Balam Empire fell. And for someone who could make Admiral Hell become Gehrman Sparrow's marionette without putting up any resistance, they were definitely not something a mere title could accomplish.\nAt this moment, Alger suddenly thought of something, something that left a deep impression on\nhim.\nAfter Vice Admiral Hurricane Qilangos successfully fled, he was found standing by the side of an artificial lake. His face had rapidly rotted with pieces of flesh falling off. Even his eyeballs had rolled out of their sockets.\nIt was undoubtedly the damage dealt by a potent force from the Death domain. And Alger later confirmed that it was done by Mr. Fool's Blessed.\nTo rapidly cause the death of a pirate admiral without him putting up any resistance, especially one who carried such a powerful Sealed Artifact, the assailant's level was obvious!\nThe Church of Storms's Spellsinger of God Archbishop Snake had determined at the scene that it was done by a High-Sequence Beyonder from the Death pathway and that it was not the person he knew.\nAlger had no doubts about that. He believed that it was done by a Sequence 4 or Sequence 3 demigod, in other words, a saint. He also felt horrified that Mr. Fool's Blessed was a High-Sequence Beyonder.\nNow, he secretly gulped his saliva with great difficulty, believing that he had underestimated Mr. Fool back then as well as that Blessed.\nThat person wasn't a saint but a Grounded Angel, one that shared the same level as the three crowns of the various orthodox Churches!\nWhen it came to religion, the three crowns represented the various Churches' pope, pontiff, or chief shepherd.\nA Death Consul as a Blessed... Although Mr. Fool is still recovering, the amount of strength at his disposal is quite sizable... Alger's thoughts churned as his eyes shimmered. He was momentarily at a loss for words.\nCattleya sensed his gloom as she asked, \"You seem to have recalled something.\"\nAlger deliberated for two seconds before vaguely replying, \"Based on what I know, Mr. Fool has a Death angel amongst his Blessed.\"\nThat matches... Cattleya said as though she was muttering to herself, \"Then why did The World promise me Mythical Creature blood that's not from that Death angel? Is it due to having closer ties with the other one, making it easier to obtain?\"\n\"Perhaps.\" Although Alger felt that Admiral of Stars's inference wasn't wrong, he habitually gave a noncommittal answer.\nCattleya didn't continue on the topic as she said, \"We will start the operation tonight from half-past seven to eight.\n\"If you can participate in it, head over there with me.\"\nShe has finally figured out the situation with the Artisan? Alger secretly heaved a sigh of relief and asked in puzzlement, \"Why that time?\"\nThis wasn't the most suitable period for any covert operation. Once any mistake was made, the official Beyonders would quickly detect it and rush over.\nCattleya nudged the heavy glasses on her nose and said with a complicated smile, \"It's because it's dinnertime for them.\n\"And they will be having mushrooms for dinner.\"\nWhat's the connection... The experienced Alger realized that he couldn't read the subcontext of Admiral of Stars's words.\nEast Balam, in the lush and humid forest.\nKlein deliberately avoided the main path and came to an uninhabited area. He planned on getting Ludwell to take off his silver mask.\nThis wasn't only to satisfy his curiosity but for a genuine reason. The silver mask was too striking. If he didn't deal with it, there was no amount of disguising that could direct the attention of others away from it.\nThe biggest problem for a Marionettist is the marionette's identity... The more powerful the marionette, the more famous they were while alive. Bringing one along with me has the risk of being exposed... If it wasn't because I didn't have the time to finish off the pirates on the Black Tulip, I would have had the means to keep it under wraps. For example, I could continue letting Ludwell be the captain while I pretend to be his subordinate. To a Faceless, that's very simple... Klein sighed as he passed through the forest.\nThere were many mosquitoes around him, but none of them came for him. All of them were circling Admiral Hell Ludwell, trying to suck his blood in vain.\nKlein had given his new marionette the Green Essence ring which attracted mosquitoes. This was because its effects were completely overshadowed by Flower of Blood. Wearing the two rings was rather meaningless for Winner Enzo. In addition, Klein had confirmed that Ludwell's situation was special. He wasn't too afraid of being bitten by mosquitoes.\nAfter walking a distance, Klein casually tossed a coin and stopped.\nAfter a few minutes of contemplation, he decided to finish something else before removing the new marionette's mask. This was because, through this process, he could confirm the severity of the latent danger beneath the mask.\nTaking out the corresponding items, Klein quickly set up a ritual and moved the radio transceiver from above the gray fog to the real world.\nHe wanted to contact Arrodes!\nBefore he left Kolain City, he had paid Miss Magician 350 pounds for the spirit world coordinates to Calder\u00f3n City. He had also been warned about the extreme dangers associated with it. Therefore, he planned on obtaining more information from two channels in order to prepare for his hunting mission.\nThe two channels involved asking the magic mirror and Red Light. With Mr. Azik being in prolonged slumber, Klein decided not to hesitate further. He planned on expanding his social circle, and not just stubbornly and inflexibly stick to the Evernight Goddess. He needed to find powers to balance things out. And the relatively friendly Seven Lights of the spirit world were the best choice!\nWith the appearance of the radio transceiver, the surrounding woods suddenly turned gloomy. It was as though the spirit world had overlapped with the real world.\nIn about ten seconds, tapping sounds sounded. Illusory white paper began being spat out:\n\"Exalted Great Master, your puny, loyal and humble servant, Arrodes, is here to answer your summoning.\n\"There's temporarily no danger here. What say you?\"\nSeeing this coquettish manner of speech, Klein sighed silently and finally confirmed that he had connected to the magic mirror, Arrodes.\nHe had previously been afraid that the white piece of paper would have the words: \"I want to have a child with you.\"\nOf course, he had divined the level of danger of contacting Arrodes above the gray fog, and he obtained an answer that it was fine. However, with the Mother Tree of Desire having a precedent of interfering with divination, as well as his misinterpretation of infiltrating Saint Samuel Cathedral's Chanis Gate, he wasn't too certain.\n\"Indeed.\" Klein nodded in a reserved manner before asking. \"What do you know of Calder\u00f3n City in the spirit world?\"\nAmidst clicking sounds, a piece of illusory white paper exited the radio transceiver in a hesitant manner:\n\"I can't see that city too clearly. I do not know its exact state, but I can confirm that a saint had perished in there before. There were also certain angels, Travelers, and spirit world creatures who had once entered to explore it and left it alive in a relatively smooth manner. However, none of them got much out of it.\n\"Also, I know the origins of that city.\"\nWithout waiting for Klein to press, more illusory white paper spat out amidst clicking sounds:\n\"Its former name was the City of the Dead. It was a grounded divine kingdom of the ancient goddess, Phoenix Ancestor Gregrace.\n\"Ever since that ancient goddess opened up the Underworld, \u2018Her' divine kingdom was moved there. The City of the Dead gradually became the holy grounds of \u2018Her' descendants and believers.\n\"Before Gregrace was heavily injured by the ancient sun god and had the city uprooted and thrown deep into the spirit world, none of its citizens ever came out again. The name \u2018Calder\u00f3n' originates from the Abraham family's angel, the first person who stepped in. In the Language of the Dead, it means \u2018Unknown Soul.'\""}
{"num_chp":819,"summary":"Amidst a soothing melody, Klein and Hazel began dancing with their backs straight. One was tall and slim, and apart from the clear difference in age, their movements, demeanor, and looks were highly compatible. It was a beautiful sight to behold, one that could almost be used as a prime example for dancing.\nKlein took the initiative to break the silence. As they twirled, he casually said, \"I often had nightmares some time ago, but thankfully I had the Goddess's blessings. I prayed a few times at the cathedral and drank a few cups of holy water, and after that, I stopped jolting awake.\"\nHazel silently looked up and, after two seconds, asked, \"What kind of nightmare?\"\nTo think you will be interested in such a topic... Will Auceptin was right after all...Klein replied with a smile, \"I was being pursued by all kinds of monsters inside an abandoned, dilapidated cathedral.\n\"But you probably know, it's almost impossible to remember the details in a dream. I find it difficult to describe those monsters.\"\nHazel didn't say a word, but her bright, brown eyes were colored with dissent.\nThat also meant that she believed that dreams weren't necessarily impossible to recall.\nKlein took a step diagonally with her in his arms as he said with a smile, \"Indeed, I've had a very clear dream in the past.\n\"Back then, I was still in the Southern Continent. I dreamed of an inverted mausoleum. It was constructed from pitch-black stone columns that extended underground. There were zombies covered in white feathers that appeared from them in a bid to pull me in.\n\"I had such dreams for several days, and it's really quite embarrassing. I was very afraid back then, so I frantically went to a nearby city and found a divination club. I got them to interpret my dream, and I received the conclusion that during one of my purchases of local goods, I had offended the faith of a tribe that believed in Death.\n\"Strangely, when I went to the tribe to apologize, gave them gifts, and participated in their celebrations, I never had that dream again.\"\nHe had fabricated the story from his experience as a Seer. His goal was to pique Hazel's interest to see if she would unknowingly reveal something. At the same time, this was a suggestion with a deeper meaning, one that wouldn't garner suspicion. The deeper meaning was that Hazel could find a divination club member or a cathedral's priest to interpret her dream if she was troubled by it. It was best not to make rash choices while blindly believing the contents of the dream.\nWhen Will Auceptin mentioned that there was something wrong with Hazel and suggested chatting about dreams, Klein suspected that her dilemma stemmed from a dream that kept happening. Otherwise, it was hard to explain how, despite being at least a Sequence 8, she had a severe lack of knowledge towards the mysterious world with her blind arrogance. Furthermore, she was a lady from high society who had been educated at home. Thus, it made it difficult for her to make contact with unaffiliated Beyonders or those without clear intentions. After all, her father was a Member of Parliament who was definitely protected. She likely had no lack of Beyonders around her.\nTherefore, Klein believed that Hazel might have made contact with something or had caught the fancy of some powerful Beyonder due to her personality. Through dreams, she was slowly guided to become a Beyonder, without giving her the necessary knowledge. At the same time, the entity enticed her to dig in the sewers to search for something.\nThere were two reasons that solidified his theory. Firstly, it was because of Will Auceptin's words. Secondly, Sequence 5 of the Marauder pathway was Dream Stealer. It was impossible that it only had the one Beyonder power of stealing the intent behind an action!\nHazel quietly listened to Dwayne Dant\u00e8s's description as her mouth subconsciously gaped before closing again. After nearly ten seconds, she asked, \"Why didn't you head to the Goddess's cathedral?\"\nAs expected, she's reacting to topics about dreams. However, she's quite careful and doesn't divulge anything...Klein smiled wryly and said, \"There weren't any cathedrals of the Goddess around. It was a region that held faith in the God of Steam and Machinery.\"\nHazel didn't continue the topic as she focused her attention back onto the dance, as though she was fully immersed in the music.\nKlein also quietened down as he swirled around in the beautiful melody with the girl.\nAfter the dance, he sent Hazel back to where she was standing, and then he headed for the long table due to his thirst, hoping to get a cup of sweet ice tea.\nAt this moment, he saw Bishop Elektra enjoying some red wine over there.\nUnlike the Church of Storms and the Church of the God of Combat, clergymen of the Evernight Goddess were prohibited from excessive drinking. They needed to reject distilled spirits, and they could only drink champagne, beer, and red and white grape wine in moderation.\n\"How is it? This should be your first time holding such a grand ball, right?\" Elektra smiled as he raised his cup.\nKlein smiled and replied, \"Very troublesome, and it's also, hmm... The biggest problem is that having so many dances in a row is exhausting. I kept sweating and wanted to drink more water.\"\nBishop Elektra chuckled and said, \"When you're here in Backlund, don't slack on any physical exercise. At times, the social scene is more tiring than you can imagine.\"\nWith that said, he said with a jibing smile, \"Ma'am Oria has endorsed you, believing that your character matches your appearance.\"\n...I'd like to thank her for her endorsement...Klein was momentarily unable to find the words to reply with as he replied in a jokingly manner, \"A person's character cannot be identified from a single dance.\"\nWithout waiting for Elektra to reveal a smile that all men understood, he switched to saying, \"Your Excellency, I've recently involved myself in some business, and I'm afraid that I might offend a gentlemen in power. I'm a little worried.\"\nHe was referring to the Coim Company and Baron Syndras.\nElektra took a sip of red wine and said, \"Don't worry. Backlund follows the rule of law. Besides, the Goddess will bless you.\"\n\"That's relieving. Praise the Lady!\" Klein seriously drew the crimson moon on his chest.\nAfter Elektra headed for the dance floor, his gaze darkened as he sighed silently.\nHe wasn't feeling fearful or hatred. He just felt a slight guilty conscious. Up to this point in time, the Church of Evernight had been good to him. Although money was the reason, they had provided him plenty of help to the point of providing him some protection. Yet, he was planning to deal with the Keepers, as well as contemplating how to steal something from the core seal behind Chanis Gate.\nSigh, if this plan takes too long to complete, I'd really need periodic psychological treatment. Otherwise, I'll have some mental problems...Klein monitored his emotions as he shook his head indiscernibly.\n...\nIn an apartment in Cherwood Borough.\nXio came home with Feynapotter pies and Desi Bay sweet ice tea. As she put it on the dining table, she said to Fors, \"Don't eat too much of such food. It's unhealthy.\"\n\"Why do you say that?\" Fors picked up a pie stuffed with fruits and ham before taking a bite.\n\"I read about it in a magazine. As a bounty hunter, maintaining one's figure is a necessity.\" Xio hesitated for a moment before pulling a pie to her mouth.\nFors scoffed.\n\"You're a Beyonder geared for combat, an extraordinary bounty hunter. There's no need to bother about maintaining your figure.\n\"Perhaps, you might've missed out on your final opportunity to grow taller as a result. Oh right, I heard that the Warrior pathway has an effective way of raising a person's height. It's obvious just from looking at those barbarians from Feysac.\"\nXio was taken aback as she suddenly sighed.\n\"But I was born as a half-Arbiter. I have no way of becoming a Warrior.\"\nClearly, she had seriously considered it in the past.\nRealizing that she had triggered her friend's memories, she acted as though she hadn't said a word as she focused on having her late dinner.\nAfter they were done eating and clearing up, Fors pulled Xio into her bedroom and cleared her throat.\n\"You've helped me tremendously, so I plan on giving you a present.\"\n\"What troublesome matter do you need help with this time?\" Xio touched her short, blonde hair warily.\n\"...\" Fors blinked as she suddenly reflected on her recent behavior.\nShe chuckled dryly and said, \"This is for the past-the past.\"\nWithout waiting for Xio to reply, she took out a metal box under Xio's doubtful gaze, one that was used to store cigars.\n\"I don't smoke,\" Xio said with a shake of her head.\nFors tersely answered as she opened the box, revealing a translucent hexagonal pillar that was light-blue in color.\nXio's gaze froze as she looked at the luster that streaked inside the crystal-like lightning as she instinctively asked, \"Interrogator?\"\n\"Yes, a participant at a Beyonder gathering was selling it cheaply. I was afraid of missing the opportunity and hurriedly bought it,\" Fors said the complete truth. \"As you know, I've recently been rewarded by my teacher because of something just a while ago. I'm not lacking in cash.\"\nXio knew that her friend had been out recently, claiming that she was doing something for her teacher. However, she found it unbelievable that she could so easily buy her an Interrogator Beyonder characteristic as a gift. This was completely unlike her original lifestyle!\nIs she still gambling, having earned large sums of money after becoming an Astrologer? Or did she finally cast her sights onto a bank vault and used her Door Opening powers to rob the cash inside?Many guesses flashed through Xio's mind, but she wasn't able to find the corresponding proof.\nAbout two to three seconds later, she made a decision. She was to randomly pretend to head out two days a week, and she would secretly observe what Fors was doing.\nIf it wasn't for her trust in her friend's character and bottom line, she would have suspected that she had become the mistress of a powerful Beyonder or tycoon.\n\"I-it's too valuable.\" Xio waved her hand, in an attempt to reject the gift.\nFors had already thought of the excuse as she said with a smile, \"I'll have matters to trouble you with in the future. Just treat it as an advanced payment.\"\n\"We are good friends. There's no need to talk about payment,\" Xio hesitated for a second as she said with a shake of her head.\nI was waiting for you to say that!Fors immediately smiled and said, \"Then treat it as an early birthday present. Don't you reject it!\"\n\"But my birthday is more than half a year away...\" As Xio muttered, she eventually reached out and took the Interrogator Beyonder characteristic.\n...\nSunday afternoon. Xio repressed her excitement and anticipation as she headed out as per normal. She planned on heading to a specific spot to leave a corresponding mark to schedule a meeting with the masked man from MI9 at some secluded alley.\nAfter obtaining the Interrogator's Beyonder characteristic and having digested her Sheriff potion, all she needed was the correct formula to advance to Sequence 7. It would be a crucial step for her investigation of the truth and restoring her family's honor. Therefore, she was eager to receive a few more missions from the military to accumulate the amount of contributions she needed.\nAfter doing all of this, she planned on circling East Borough first to see if there was any important news. Then, she planned on returning home to tail Fors, so that she could figure out what her good friend was up to, or if she was in any danger.\nHowever, the moment she entered East Borough, she had a hunch that someone was staring at her."}
{"num_chp":1367,"summary":"As he didn't know what state Amon was in right now, Klein didn't dare delay. After his mental problems were resolved, he immediately came to Calder\u00f3n City and prepared to obtain the river water of the River of Eternal Darkness.\nAnd because it involved a sefirah, he could only vaguely see some visions when using divination or making a prophecy. He couldn't accurately make a judgment.\nAfter surveying the area, Klein raised his hand to summon the Historical Void projection from a few minutes ago, allowing his true body to return to Sefirah Castle.\nHis consciousness then shifted to the projection, making it corporeal.\nFollowing that, Klein grabbed at the void again and pulled out the Staff of the Stars's historical projection.\nTo be honest, after being able to use most of the Beyonder powers below Sequence 0 of the Apprentice pathway through Sefirah Castle, Klein no longer needed a Grade 0 Sealed Artifact like the Staff of the Stars. He could basically replicate whatever mystical effects it had without the negative effects.\nHowever, he always felt that an angel still had to possess a close-combat weapon because it was possible to fall into a region that nullified Beyonder powers at some point in time.\nIn the mysterious world, this was definitely something that could happen. Be it the law restrictions from the Arbiter pathway, or the Beyonder effects of a particular Outer Deity, it was possible to achieve similar effects.\nUnder such circumstances, if he picked up a hard staff that came with passive effects and directly smashed it in the enemy's head, it would prove to be rather effective.\nAs a King of Angels of the Seer pathway, making preparations in all aspects was an instinct!\nAfter weighing the Staff of the Stars and pressing down on his top hat, Klein took out the golden bird-shaped accessory from Sefirah Castle and placed it in his left breast pocket.\nThen, he took a step and entered Calder\u00f3n City, the divine kingdom of ancient Death-Phoenix Ancestor Gregrace.\nThe first thing that entered his vision was a huge bottomless pit. All sorts of strange buildings circled the deep pit and extended downwards in circles, forming a grand city that was beyond the understanding of ordinary people.\nSome of the buildings were standalone houses that stood atop pale-white stone pillars, while others were huge rectangular coffins. There were no windows, and the doors were on the roofs. Some of them were just tombs with gravestones at the entrance, while others were constructed from all kinds of bones, making them seem rather messy...\nThe closer to the bottom of the pit, the more intact the buildings were. The closer they got to the top, the more they collapsed, filled with the decay and ruin of time.\nWith just a glance, Klein made a faint grayish-white fog appear around him. He directly used Sefirah Castle's status to resist the laws of Calder\u00f3n City which turned all living beings into the dead.\nTo him, becoming a dead person wasn't a negative effect, but he didn't like that cold and indifferent feeling.\nThe grayish-white tide that rose previously has receded... Klein, who was wearing a top hat and trench coat while carrying the staff, nodded in thought. With one step, he stepped deep into Calder\u00f3n City, which could be seen with the naked eye.\nThis time, he used the Marauder pathway's Beyonder powers to steal the distance of his perception so as to avoid being entangled with the various dangerous monsters that were active in this mysterious city.\nThis wasn't something he was afraid of. The ones who should be afraid were the monsters. If it wasn't for the fact that he didn't wish to waste time, he wouldn't have minded taking the opportunity to gather a batch of marionettes to make up for the losses caused by the destruction of Utopia.\nApart from this reason, Klein was still cautious about something else.\nCalder\u00f3n City was a city of the dead. It was very likely that in the deepest depths of the city flowed the River of Eternal Darkness. And in essence, marionettes were already dead, so once they approached anywhere close to the bottom, there was a possibility of a mutation.\nVenturing deeper one step at a time, Klein realized that he had thought too much.\nNone of the monsters hidden in this strange city dared to appear. The aura of Sefirah Castle allowed their instinctual desire to live to overcome their inclinations of madness and their habits of hunting.\nThe deeper he went, the quieter his surroundings became. The strange buildings remained intact, but they seemed to be dead for years. Even their auras were cold, gloomy, and decadent.\nIt's the same as looking at a black-and-white film. If I didn't hear my breathing and heartbeat, I would've suspected that I was deaf... Klein coughed lightly and used his grumbling to resist the silence of death.\nHis intuition told him that once he got used to this environment, his body and mind would become still and silent. Then, he would truly die in the full meaning of the word.\nThe closer he got to the ground, the stronger this feeling became.\nAs he kept stealing the distance, Klein proceeded forward for a long time before finally seeing the bottom of the pit.\nNo, this wasn't the true base of the pit. It was just a huge, black palace that stood in the way.\nThe palace was propped up by columns. There were all kinds of bones and different corpse pieces embedded in them. Some parts of the palace were even covered in blood. They belonged to different races.\nKlein stared at it for a few seconds. Without any hesitation, he carried the Staff of the Stars and entered the palace through the open door.\nOn both sides of the hall were different types of coffins in different colors. They sat there silently, as if they had already been weathered by death.\nAs Klein entered, there was a sudden noise coming from inside the coffins. It sounded like a rusted joint opening.\nThe grayish-white fog around Klein thickened again as all the coffins suddenly quietened down.\nIgnoring them, Klein walked to the depths of the hall. There was a grayish-white stone staircase descending with a huge stone monument erected at the entrance.\nAt the top of the stone monument stood a long and slender statue that resembled a giant bird made of bronze. Its wings had all kinds of pale-white symbols.\nUnder the bronze bird-shaped statue, the surface of the stone monument was written in text that originated from the Language of the Dead. Their shapes were all different, looking like simplified birds or coiled snakes that looked different. They formed a few indistinct words:\n\"Even deities cannot escape;\n\"Imprisonment even in death.\"\nIs this a warning to all living beings who come to Calder\u00f3n City to not go down the stairs? It directly leads to the River of Eternal Darkness? Klein's thoughts raced as he carefully read the words on the stone monument.\nFrom his point of view, this meant that, even if a Sequence 0 true deity were to approach the River of Eternal Darkness, they would be trapped there and unable to escape. And even if they were to die, they would still be imprisoned by this abstract river, this sefirah. Although they wouldn't dissipate, they wouldn't be able to escape.\nFrom the looks of it, it's just like the Chaos Sea. Without any sefirot protection, merely approaching the River of Eternal Darkness will result in a terrifying mutation... Klein retracted his gaze and tidied up the golden bird-shaped accessory attached to his breast pocket. He walked past the bronze statue's stone monument and walked down the grayish-white staircase.\nHe didn't steal the distance again, to prevent himself from slamming headfirst into danger.\nIn the dark, silent, and cold environment, the golden bird-shaped accessory in front of Klein's chest released a pale-white glow, illuminating a small area. It was like a tiny lifeboat struggling in the waves of death.\nAfter descending for an unknown period of time, the aura of Sefirah Castle around him expanded out of reflex and became extremely thick, like a grayish-white cocoon.\nAt the same time, Klein turned his head slightly and heard a faint, illusory whooshing sound.\nThis seemed to indicate that a dark river was slowly flowing deep underground not far from him.\nIn the next second, Klein looked down at his feet.\nAt some point in time, there was a dark stream of incorporeal water surging out from somewhere.\nEven light couldn't exist on its surface.\nThis is different from what I saw last time... Klein frowned slightly.\nBack when he came to Calder\u00f3n City to hunt the Spirit World Plunderer, he had caused a certain change, causing large amounts of grayish-white illusory tidal water to surge up the bottom of the pit.\nThe colors that he saw the two times were completely different.\nJust as Klein's thoughts raced, at the bottom of the stone staircase, where the dark tide surged over, a thin grayish-white fog spread up. Together with the illusory liquid, it expanded into a grayish-white liquid that was more mist-like.\nWhen the water reached Klein's feet, it silently shrank back as though it was constantly ebbing up and down at a particular frequency.\nThis faint gray fog is a little familiar... Klein's expression turned solemn.\nAfter pausing for a few seconds, he continued down.\nThis time, the rising illusory tide drowned him, causing his body to turn light, causing his emotions to quickly turn cold and his thoughts to gradually weaken.\nIf not for the protection of Sefirah Castle's aura around him, Klein suspected that he would passively fuse with the tide without being able to resist.\nFollowing that, the grayish-white cocoon rose and bobbed up and down in the water before slowly reaching the end of the staircase.\nAt the end was a void. Amidst the emptiness flowed a straight, wide, illusory, colorless, dark river.\nThis river was so blurry that it was difficult to see it clearly. This was because its surroundings were covered with a swath of grayish-white like a thin layer of fog.\n\"Indeed...\" Klein couldn't help but mutter when he saw this.\nHe was no stranger to this kind of fog. He had seen it behind the door in Bansy's ruins before. He had seen it at the easternmost end of the Forsaken Land of the Gods before, as well as beneath Sefirah Castle!\nAnd unlike other places, there was a portion of the water from the River of Eternal Darkness that penetrated the grayish-white fog and fused to some extent with the latter, changing colors between dark-black and pale-white.\nThe river water here kept swirling up before falling down, like a stream that was running through the illusory darkness.\nOn both sides of the distributary stood huge and pale-white stone pillars. They seemed to be supporting something, preventing whatever it was from collapsing.\nAt this moment, between the stone pillars, and on the banks of the distributary, countless blurry, translucent figures were pacing back and forth, slowly but unceasingly.\nAmong them, the most eye-catching one was a seemingly lost figure that would occasionally enter into the depths of the distributary before turning around. Yet, it didn't seem like it could leave the river.\nIt was huge, similar to the stone pillars around it. It had a heavy black robe draped over it, and from its side profile, it looked very old.\nSuddenly, it turned its head and looked at Klein.\nIts face had obvious Southern Continent characteristics, but it had already rotted while white feathers stained with pale yellow oil grew out.\nKlein knew \"Him,\" and \"He\" was Mr. Azik's father, the Death of the Fourth Epoch:\nEmperor of the Underworld Salinger."}
{"num_chp":770,"summary":"Mr. X is looking for people with abnormal luck?Above the gray fog, Klein ruminated over the information Miss Magician had provided, in an attempt to analyze anything of use.\nAfter thinking to no avail, he decided to approach it from another angle. He first recalled the people who had abnormal luck around him to see if there were any connections.\nHmm... The Fog Sea's Strongest Hunter Anderson Hood counts as one... Dr. Aaron Ceres is another... Hmm, both of them were affected by one of the Snakes of Fate... Angel of Fate Ouroboros was one of the creators of Rose Redemption. This secret organization supports and believes the True Creator... The Aurora Order is equivalent to the True Creator's Church...A series of circumstances surfaced in Klein's mind as he quickly came to a conclusion.\nThis is Angel of Fate Ouroboros's attempt to search for Snake of Fate Will Auceptin!\n\"He\" is driving the members of the Aurora Order to help \"Him\" find Snake of Mercury Will Auceptin!\nAnd this implies that behind Mr. X, there's a King of Angels existing somewhere in Backlund!\nUnder such circumstances, assassinating Mr. X will be equivalent to having a death wish... It's no wonder Mr. X doesn't care about the uniqueness of Backlund... The official factions would at most imagine that he has a saint backing him. Hmm, in the official dossiers, the Aurora Order only has five saints. This way, they will respond in the wrong manner...After Klein made the judgment, the first thought he had was to decline Miss Magician's request, and also to warn her not to provoke Mr. X.\nIf it wasn't because sounding the alarm might affect Snake of Mercury Will Auceptin, while the Church of the Evernight Goddess clearly had records of Dr. Aaron Ceres's bout of bad luck, Klein would've gotten Miss Magician to report both the Angel of Fate Ouroboros and Mr. X to a particular Church!\nHe calmly thought for another few seconds and conjured The World Gehrman Sparrow, making him pray in the gray fog.\n\"...I'll confirm the situation and give you a reply tomorrow.\"\nHe didn't directly reject her commission, as he planned on first asking Snake of Mercury Will Auceptin!\nHe then immediately returned to the real world, and he carefully took out the extremely fragile paper crane from his wallet before gently unfolding it.\nKlein wasn't in a rush to write anything. Instead, he first recalled the various questions he needed to consult Will on. After thinking up a draft, he got out a pencil and sharpened it with a blade.\nAfter stretching his muscles, Klein wrote:\n\"The members of the Aurora Order are searching for people with abnormal luck.\n\"I wonder if you know how to use the Worm of Time to create charms.\n\"Does your placenta blood count as a Mythical Creature's blood? If it does, I hope to obtain one drop. What price would I have to offer?\"\nKlein had originally planned on asking Will Auceptin how he was able to maintain \"His\" rationality. After all, the Church's information indicated that there had been no public faith in the Snake of Fate. However, he ultimately curbed himself from doing that, afraid that Will Auceptin in \"His\" infant state replied, \"How did you conceive the notion that I'm rational?\"\nThat way, he had no idea if Will was joking or speaking the truth.\nHmm, although there's no organization that believes in the Snake of Fate, there are certain areas that believe in the God of Luck; it's considered a traditional custom... Perhaps \"They\" are an alternative identity of Will Auceptin or Ouroboros...Klein mumbled silently and used the best of his Clown abilities before managing to refold the paper crane. He then placed it underneath his pillow.\nAfter doing all of that, he had the time to calculate how much cash he had.\n17,046 pounds, 5 gold coins, 3 soli, and 8 pence in change... If I had assets like a house, manor, and company shares, having so many liquid assets would make me quite a tycoon in Backlund... Of course, I'm still very far from being a top tycoon. To reach them, one's overall assets need to be a million pounds...As Klein was glad that he had quite a bit of money, he recalled his debt, as well as the large investments that he needed to make in order to develop his persona's image.\nHe then drank a mouthful of water, got into bed, and covered himself with a light but warm blanket before he slowly fell asleep.\nAmidst his reverie, Klein suddenly snapped awake and saw the desolate black plains.\nHe walked all the way to the pitch-black steeple in the middle of the plains, passing through the chaotic and abnormal layout before coming deep into the steeple. Like before, there was a circle of tarot cards on the ground.\nHowever, the protruding area in the middle of the tarot cards didn't have any silvery lines written.\nWill Auceptin didn't give a reply... Then why did he pull me into this dream?Amidst Klein's puzzlement, he suddenly saw a black baby pram roll out of the shadows. In it was an infant whose looks were indiscernible while it was wrapped in silver silk!\n\"...Mr. Snake of Fate?\" Klein politely and cautiously asked.\nThe infant immediately said in a clear voice, \"What makes you so sure it's a mister?\"\nIsn't that determined from your name? Don't mind such details!Klein lampooned and relaxed due to the attitude he was given.\n\"Then, how may I address you?\"\nWill Auceptin in baby form tersely answered as it said, stumped, \"I haven't decided...\n\"As you know, oh-you don't. Every time I start again, I try to make myself a little different, so as to maintain a good mental state. A child should act like a child while they're a child.\"\nKlein's heart stirred when he heard that.\n\"Is this the way the Monster pathway maintains its reasoning so as to resist madness?\"\nIn the black pram, Will Auceptin replied briskly, \"Yes, every beginning washes away the madness. However, it still needs certain anchoring from faith; otherwise, I wouldn't be able to maintain my state as a Sequence 1 for too long.\n\"Heh heh, compared to before, you're becoming more and more knowledgeable.\"\nOh, apart from anchoring oneself with faith, there are other ways to resist the madness. However, \"restarting\" is clearly an ability of Sequence 1 Snake of Fate of the Monster pathway. Other Beyonder pathways aren't able to emulate that... Mr. Azik is constantly losing his memories and repeatedly finding himself. Does it also involve the same concept?Klein nodded in thought as he made every second count by asking, \"I suspect Ouroboros is searching for you through the Aurora Order members.\"\nWill Auceptin scoffed.\n\"I've been playing hide-and-seek with \u2018Him' for a very long time. \u2018He' isn't good at such matters. It's quite obvious that \u2018He' doesn't have a childhood. Every time he restarts, \u2018He' grows up beside the True Creator. \u2018He' lacks the psychological experience of the different stages in life, causing \u2018Him' to be very crazy at times, but of course, \u2018He' doesn't mind.\n\"I did inform Ricciardo to use the Die of Probability in certain places and leave marks. This will mess up Ouroboros's judgment. \u2018He' will soon leave Backlund once again.\"\nThat means there's still chance of assassinating Mr. X... Yes, when the time comes, I'll divine the level of danger above the gray fog...Klein didn't continue on this topic as he asked, \"Do you know how to use the Worm of Time to create charms?\"\nWill Auceptin didn't directly answer and instead returned with a question, \"You obtained a Worm of Time from Pallez Zoroast?\"\n\"How did you know?\" Klein was taken aback as he asked.\nHe wasn't surprised that Will Auceptin had managed to mention the origins of the Worm of Time-after all, there weren't many demigods in the Marauder pathway who could create avatars-but why hadn't \u2018He' assumed that it was Blasphemer Amon? The latter could also leave behind a Worm of Time!\nWill Auceptin smiled and said, \"Pallez Zoroast isn't in good condition, and he had to parasitize your former colleague. Ah right, your former colleague was investigating Sherlock Moriarty, and he had entered my house in the middle of the night.\n\"I sensed that there was something problematic about him and had given him a short period of bad luck, causing him to encounter other demigods hidden in Backlund. And when he was in danger, Pallez Zoroast had taken action. Haha, it would've been fine even if he hadn't taken action. It's only a prank. I would've given your former colleague sufficient good luck at the critical moment.\"\nLeonard is investigating Sherlock Moriarty? The Grandpa in his body is called Pallez Zoroast...Klein frowned slightly, unsure where the problem stemmed from.\nWill Auceptin continued, \"The creation of a Worm of Time charm isn't too difficult for you. You can pray to that uniqueness trait about you and use a compound of mercury and pure silver as a medium to draw the corresponding symbols.\"\nIt's not too difficult... Pray to The Fool? That's right. The mysterious space above the gray fog clearly has a form of attraction to the Marauder pathway...Klein was thrilled as he felt like he had grasped something.\nAt this moment, Will smiled and added, \"As for what the corresponding symbol is, I've no idea.\"\n...What a huge reversal...Klein couldn't help but twitch the corner of his lips.\nWhen he noticed that Will Auceptin wasn't speaking any further, he hurriedly smiled and said, \"There's another question. About your placenta blood...\"\nBefore he could finish his sentence, Will suddenly opened his mouth and let out a cry.\n\"Waaa!\"\nHe began wailing like a real infant.\n...Can't we talk normally...Klein froze in his spot.\nIf he hadn't already confirmed it, he really would've suspected whether the entity before him was a Sequence 1, the president of the Life School of Thought.\n\"Alright, alright. I just wanted to ask if it's the blood of a Mythical Creature,\" Klein said as he raised his hands midway.\nWill stopped crying and said with a laugh, \"Of course, but I'll swap it ahead of time. Otherwise, everyone will die on the spot.\"\nHe paused for a moment before saying, \"If you can give me something suitable, it's not impossible to give you one drop.\n\"Alright, goodbye!\"\nJust as Will Auceptin said that, Klein felt the steeple shake as the dream rapidly shattered.\nSoon, he woke up."}
{"num_chp":629,"summary":"Amidst the holy beam of light, having already lost its support from the external power, the tree warts and flesh rapidly disintegrated. It was like snow meeting a red-hot metal ball.\nAmidst an indescribable sizzling sound, Cynthia's face winced as abnormal agony showed itself on her face.\nShe turned around with great difficulty, looking up and down, her expression turning horrified and confused. Finally, she realized that there was a problem with her.\n\"Admiral...\" Her voice trembled as she looked ahead with fear and despair, but all she could find was an unfamiliar face.\nKlein could've fed Creeping Hunger with Cynthia's remnant flesh and Spirit Body, but at that moment, he sighed and said with a calm voice, \"Try not to make contact with strange artifacts or religions in the future.\"\nFrom his point of view, the reason why Cynthia had turned into this monstrosity either had to do with a cult or some particularly dangerous artifact. She had connected with some existence which couldn't be looked at directly, resulting in such a response.\nCynthia seemed to understand something as her remnant head and tiny bit of flesh suddenly wept.\n\"It's the Mother Tree of Desire, the Heavenly Body Sect...\n\"Admiral, Admiral, I don't want to die! I don't want to die!\n\"Save me! Save me!\"\nMother Tree of Desire... Heavenly Body Sect... This isn't within the confines of my knowledge of mysticism...Klein maintained his expression as he looked pitifully at the pleading Cynthia. He spread his arms again and said in a deep voice, \"Death is not the end. You will be redeemed when you are at god's side.\"\nAnother pure beam of light landed as Cynthia's beautiful, weeping face completely fixed in place.\nHer eyes widened in despair, but there was the remnant hope of being sent to heaven after death.\nUnder the sun's radiance, her brain and remnant flesh melted away at a discernible pace. By vanishing, it had obtained its final rite of cleansing.\nKlein looked silently at this scene without any expression or movement.\nAfter everything calmed down, he curled the corner of his lips and chuckled, finding it hard to hide his sorrow.\n\"This is really a crazy and chaotic world...\"\nHe didn't dare to channel Cynthia's spirit after what had happened. The many oddities had made him abandon the thought of bringing Cynthia's Spirit Body above the gray fog to \"inquire.\" Faced with the irremovable evil and the ever-worsening corruption, he could only choose to have Cynthia be cleansed. After all, in this world with true gods, there might exist a heaven after death.\nAs for Creeping Hunger's backlash, Klein was temporarily not concerned. After spending a long time with it, this mystical item which had been sealed to a certain extent had adjusted to him. It didn't need to be fed after every use. It had been restored to its original state. Once it was activated, it just needed to eat once in a twenty-four-hour period, regardless of how many times it was used. Of course, there was no need for it to be fed on the day it wasn't used.\nTherefore, Klein had plenty of time to seek out food for Creeping Hunger without harming the innocent.\nIf the worst comes to the worst, I can throw it above the gray fog...Klein surveyed his surroundings, and he realized that the bodyguards and the male and female attendants in the room had shaken off the influence of their magnified desires, and they had fallen unconscious. This included the maidservant who was strangling her companion in a bid to obtain her approval and praise, as well as blond secretary, Luan.\nIndeed, once the problem is resolved at its root, everything will come to an end...\nAccording to Admiral Amyrius's description, Luan is at least a Sequence 6 Beyonder, and he's suspected to be a Baron of Corruption. He might've secretly reached Sequence 5... Even he was so easily controlled by his magnified desires, which means that the power that descended with the help of Cynthia is extremely potent. But why did I only have a wet dream...\nIgnoring my mystical items, Luan and I should be at the same level...\nIs it because a portion of the gray fog's power, when mixed with reality, provided me with help? Is it because of the restriction from Admiral Amyrius's temporary contract? Or could it be a mix of both?\nYes, if it wasn't because of these factors, as Cynthia's primary target, my desire towards sex would definitely be magnified. This wouldn't just be me having a romantic dream...Klein habitually reached out with his right hand to cover his face as he changed once again back into Amyrius Rieveldt's appearance.\nAs the lives of the others weren't temporarily under threat, he carefully observed the room when his spiritual perception was suddenly triggered.\nTaking a few steps forward, Klein came to where Cynthia had vanished. He bent down and picked up a necklace from a pile of torn clothes on the bed.\nA pendant that was the length of a finger segment hung from the necklace. It was completely black in color and looked like a miniaturized rhinoceros horn. Its surface was full and covered in cracks. Apart from exuding evil, there were no lustrous spirituality activity.\nThis is the dangerous item that caused Cynthia to mutate? As it had connected to the existence which couldn't be looked at directly, it had completed its mission, allowing all its powers to be injected into Cynthia's body?Klein made a preliminary conjecture based on the pendant's situation and from his past experience.\nHe checked the area and found nothing. Hence, he pulled out a paper figurine and dealt with the traces left behind. He dispelled the prohibition from the charm before walking towards Secretary Luan, who still had some signs of corruption due to temporarily being devoured by the flowers. He raised his knee and kicked him a few times with the tip of his shoe.\nWith Amyrius's character, it's unlikely that he would crouch down to shake his secretary awake... Heh, this fellow's arrogant way of looking down on others sure is irritating. I really want to beat him up...Klein paused as he watched sternly as Luan gradually woke up.\n\"Your Excellency...\" Luan was in a momentary daze, as though he couldn't tell dream from reality.\nAs a high-ranking superior, I'm under no obligation to explain...Klein looked down at him and said in a deep voice, \"Wake up all the lightly injured people. Get a number of them to treat the remaining people while the others are to investigate the Heavenly Body Sect on Oravi Island. They worship an evil god named Mother Tree of Desire. Um... Start the investigation with the people around Cynthia.\n\"I'll be waiting in the study for the report.\"\nWith that said, he held the cracked rhinoceros horn pendant and turned to leave the master bedroom before entering the unaffected silent study.\nAs an important member of the military, although he was somewhat helpless when faced with the kingdom's upper echelons, he needed to choose to ignore certain matters. An example was the telegram which relieved Aston from his post as governor-general and the arrival of the new governor-general. This meant that the new governor-general had departed ahead of time; yet as the highest-ranking commander of the Central Sonia Sea's navy, Amyrius Rieveldt had not received the news at all. However, on Oravi Island, to Secretary Luan and the local police system and naval base personnel, he still held absolute authority. He didn't need to do the investigations himself, as he had plenty of people at his disposal.\nA demigod only needed to be wary against any accidents and await news. There was no need to busy themselves!\nInside the study, as Klein heard the chaotic sound of footsteps and horrified screams, questioning, and exchanges, he couldn't help but have the starry sky and the bright, lustrous star surface in his mind.\nWhat does it represent?Klein frowned and sat in the armchair behind the desk. His figure sank into the darkness brought about by the curtains.\nHe soon made certain connections. Due to the legends from the City of Silver and Emlyn White's description of the Sanguine's situation, he confirmed that the Moon pathway controlled a portion of the authority over reproduction and proliferation. This coincided with Cynthia's intentions and actions.\nA starry sky... Mr. Door informed Emperor Roselle that the Goddess's corresponding tarot card is The Star and not The Moon. Could it be that this illusory starry sky represents \"Her\"? Yes, The Primordial Moon is suspected to be a particular deity, angel, or high-level devil's alternate identity. The Goddess has the honorific name of \"crimson moon.\" Could \"She\" be the one passing herself off as the Primordial Moon and occupying the corresponding spot so as to control the required authority?Although Klein knew that such thoughts were sacrilegious, he couldn't help but suspect the Evernight Goddess.\nBut he soon rejected that conjecture. This was because, be it Vampire Ancestor Lilith or the Primordial Moon, what they projected was only \"reproduction and proliferation.\" It didn't include the recognition of gluttony, pride, and desire. This was at odds with a number of victims earlier. The other honorific titles of the Evernight Goddess didn't include the corresponding domains.\nThis does coincide with the traits of the Devil pathway. A Desire Apostle is an expert in such matters... Could the one subjugating the Primordial Moon be a high-level Devil, or even the King of Devils who's known as the Dark Side of the Universe, Sequence 0 Abyss? This is very possible, but the problem with this is that it shouldn't produce an illusory starry sky and bright stars. Be it Moon or Abyss, they have nothing to do with the corresponding symbols...Klein found his conjecture problematic the more he thought over the matter.\nAmidst his thoughts, he suddenly thought of a concept.\nIt was something important back when he was first educated in mysticism but had never received a detailed description or explanation!\nThat was the astral world!\nApart from the Life School of Thought and a few other organizations' belief in uncommon concepts such as the world of absolute rationality, most schools of thought in mysticism believed that the world was comprised of the real world, the spirit world, and the astral world.\nThere was no need to explain the real world. Knowledge of the spirit world was the foundation of many ritualistic magic and Beyonder powers. It was only the astral world where Klein's knowledge about it was basically zero.\nTherefore, the illusory starry sky represents the astral world. The bright star is a particular existence in the astral world? I've always suspected that the astral world is where the true gods reside. Then, this imagery which represents the Primordial Moon isn't something unacceptable...Klein didn't think further as he recalled the details of the past few days while awaiting the results of his subordinates' investigations.\nTime ticked by when Klein finally heard a familiar gait approach.\nSecretary Luan knocked before entering. He bowed his head and coldly reported, \"Your Excellency. We've already found the Heavenly Body Sect and captured their leader.\n\"It was a clue provided by Miss Cynthia's parents.\n\"This sect has been rather active in Oravi over the past few years. They do not wear clothes, in a bid to return to nature. Giving themselves up to their instincts is their purpose, and they believed that humans can attain liberation of their spirituality in such states.\n\"Reproduction of the next generation is a subsidiary product of this belief.\"\nAfter pausing for a moment, Luan added, \"Their leader is a Beyonder, a Sequence 8 Lunatic.\"\nLunatic? A Lunatic from the Prisoner pathway? It has something to do with the Rose School of Thought? Yes, the Rose School of Thought internally has two factions, \"temperance\" and \"indulgence.\" The latter's beliefs are rather identical to the present situation...Klein was alarmed as he said in a stoic tone, \"Bring him here.\""}
{"num_chp":547,"summary":"The huge eye, which had its blacks and whites clear, appeared translucent. It floated quietly behind saturated, overlapping colors. Klein couldn't tell if it was hostile or friendly.\nAt this moment, Klein remembered a passage from the Sights in the Spirit World. The ancestor of the Abraham family had said: \"Try not to cross eyes with any creatures of the spirit world for more than three seconds unless they have already expressed interest in communicating with you. This is considered provocative behavior. Also, do not let yourself appear terrified and nervous. For some predators, this will increase their desire to attack.\"\nAs the words flowed through his mind, Klein retracted his gaze and continued to \"chase\" after the flying hardwood cane in front of him, at a rather adequate speed.\nThe sight of the full black armor set and black crown he donned, matched with a cloak of the same color, entered the round eye. But the figure quickly passed by, disappearing far away. It didn't stir up the slightest change.\nIn essence, the spirit world is a very dangerous place. If one isn't careful, one can encounter a terrifying existence at the demigod level...As Klein continued to make his way through, he realized that this place was truly chaotic. Although the seven lustrous brilliances that could be used to mark his location remained high above, covering the \"sky,\" they could still be seen from time to time beneath his feet, to his left and right, and from the front and back.\nIf not for his black cane, Klein wouldn't have been able to determine his bearings.\nSuddenly, through the faint fog of the void, he saw, on his left-based on a normal human being's concept of left-a floating castle. It was entirely black in color. Its spire towered, and it was covered with vines, extremely reminiscent of a Gothic style.\nAt the top of the castle stood a translucent woman who was almost as tall as the castle. She was wearing a complex, gorgeous, dark, and gloomy black dress. She didn't have a head, and there was a neat cut by her neck. Her drooping hands held four blonde heads with red eyes. If one looked closely, they would find that these brilliant-looking heads were exactly the same.\nWhen Klein, who was disguised as the Dark Emperor, passed by, the four heads the woman carried blinked.\nKlein didn't respond as he flew forward as though he hadn't seen her.\nThe woman slowly turned her body, letting the heads in her hand watch him depart.\nWhat kind of monsters are these...As the thought flashed through Klein's mind, he saw the black cane plummet rapidly.\nHe hurriedly chased after it, once again experiencing the feeling of a free fall.\nAbout eight seconds later, a faintly discernible collapsed building appeared in front of him.\nOutside of the building floated a spirit world creature which resembled a giant jellyfish. It extended transparent, sticky tentacles, and pulled the surrounding area into its own \"territory.\"\nAt the end of each tentacle grew a white skull with deep eye sockets. It kept shaking as it floated about with light but slow movements.\nThe black cane passed through the strange creature of the spirit world and hovered in front of the almost illusory collapsed building.\nFound it?Klein was delighted at first before he solemnly glanced at the giant jellyfish that was waving its skull.\nHe made preparations for battle, but he didn't attack immediately. Instead, he tried to emit the profound dignity that came with the high level of the Dark Emperor card. His eyes indifferently stared at the eye sockets that were deeply recessed.\nAfter three seconds of frozen silence, Klein said ancient Hermes in a low voice, \"Leave!\"\nThe tentacles supporting the skulls twitched twice; then, the giant \u2018jellyfish' slowly floated up, disappearing into the depths of the spirit world.\nThis Dark Emperor card is still very useful... I was already considering throwing Mr. Azik's copper whistle. The descendants of Death should still have some standing in the spirit world...Klein breathed a sigh of relief and descended, grabbing the black hardwood cane.\nThen, he fell into the collapsed building ruin, with a sense of anticipation.\nFor him, even if the Church of Storms and the kingdom's military had found this place ahead of him and had taken away the most valuable items, he would still be satisfied as long as there were still some remaining.\nEven if there's nothing else, it'll be sufficient for me to explore an elven ruins and see what information they left behind...When Klein passed through an ethereal \"barrier\" that resembled a curtain, he felt the air around him suddenly become thick and heavy.\nA shimmering wave of light appeared around him, coming from the deep blue water that filled the area.\nAt the bottom of the sea was an ancient, dark ruin. All the buildings had either collapsed or half-collapsed.\nA huge pillar, carved with strange patterns and symbols, extended out from the middle. It appeared to be heading straight up to the top, as if it had supported the place in the past, but now it was broken and was leaning on the top of a nearby building.\nKlein recognized this place, as well as the pillar. It was the hiding place of Sea God Kalvetua, a hidden place where reality blended with the spirit world.\nAt this very moment, an unwilling, pained, angry, and crazed scream echoed in the air. It didn't weaken in the slightest. That scream was precisely the same howl of hatred that Kalvetua had let out before its death.\nIt's really dead...Holding the black cane, Klein landed on the greenish-gray stone road in front of the ancient ruins.\nOn both sides of the road stood pillars that were neither thick nor tall, and on them were also strange patterns that were different from the symbols and magic labels from before.\nAt the bottom of each stone pillar, there was a figure sitting beside it. Some of them wore ancient robes, while some wore brown jackets that were fashionable nowadays.\nAs soon as they sensed someone approaching, they raised their swords, axes, and other weapons, stiffly but quickly. They turned to where Klein was, revealing their weathered, grayish-black faces and their shriveled bodies which were devoid of any flesh or blood.\nTheir eyes-feverish and numb-were fixed on Klein, who was wearing a black crown and black armor.\nKalvetua's devotees... However, this also means that the Church of Storms and the kingdom's military haven't found this place yet...Klein sighed and injected his spirituality into the Sun Brooch. He muttered a word in ancient Hermes, \"Holy!\"\nHe activated the Sun Brooch's Holy Oath, and through the corresponding word in ancient Hermes, he temporarily added a Holy attribute to the damage he dealt with his attacks.\nPa!\nKlein flicked his wrist and threw his cane.\nHe bent his body slightly and charged towards the first \"Sea God Guard\" who came rushing over.\nWhile running at high speed, Klein suddenly turned left and dodged the enemy's axe. He then swung his arm backwards and used his cane to draw a clear grayish-white crack on the enemy's body.\nPure golden flames silently rose from within the crack, wrapping around the Sea God Guard and burning it until it was on the verge of collapse.\nBam!\nKlein exerted strength into his feet and stomped past the enemy.\nBehind him, the completely desiccated Sea God Guard finally collapsed, turning into ashes within the golden flames.\nTap. Tap. Tap!Klein bent his back, quickly moving forward, sometimes to the side, and sometimes diagonally as he passed by each of the Sea God Guards.\nAt the same time, he brandished his cane, whipping, stabbing, cleaving, and slashing, leaving different marks on the guards that resembled dessicated corpses.\nTap! Tap! Tap!Klein passed through the road and arrived in front of the half-collapsed ruins.\nBehind his gently fluttering black cloak, the Sea God Guards bloomed into golden torches, lighting up the greenish-gray stone slate and the patterned pillars.\nAmidst the chaos, the guards fell down, one after the other, and no longer moved.\nKlein went up the steps and entered the building where the half-collapsed pillars were.\nThe first thing that entered his vision was an unimaginably huge blue sea serpent. The scales all over its body were slippery, and they were covered with patterns that were similar to the symbols inside the ruins.\nIts gaping jaws bit into a pillar, its curved milky-white fangs sinking in.\nIts body below its head height was slumped across the ground. Its coiled body occupied about a third of the expansive hall, like a small, blue hill. However, its surface was covered in wounds with mangled blood and flesh. Even its bones could be seen.\nA mysterious cyan light had already gathered over its body as it crept slowly towards one of its fangs that was longer than a human arm. This caused the slightly curved sharp bones to slowly straighten up.\nIts dying cry reverberated in the air, causing Klein's corporeal Spirit Body to show signs of instability.\nAt this moment, an old man wearing a clergyman's cap was lying beside Kalvetua's body.\nHis hair was gray, and his body was like a gray rock. He stuck his face tightly to the serpent's body, making incomprehensible sounds from his throat. His actions were an unknown.\nAround the gigantic serpent's corpse were dessicated corpses. They were similar to the Sea God Guards outside, but they were even more bizarre. Their stomachs bulged to the point of rupturing. In addition, their mouths were stained with dark red blood and had strips of bluish meat hanging from them.\nThe blue dots of light also leaked out from their bodies, rushing towards the white fang that was gradually straightening up.\nBefore Klein could figure out what such a scene signified, the old man in the clergyman's cap, who was lying on top of Kalvetua, stood up in a staggered manner and turned around.\nHis eyes were flashing with a blue light, his mouth was covered in blood-red meat which he was using all his strength to bite into.\nIn the place where his face had been stuck to, the snake's body was mangled. It was missing a lot of flesh and blood, and even its bones were almost visible.\nHe was eating up the corpse of Sea God Kalvetua!\nThis...Klein frowned, roughly understanding what was happening.\nAfter Kalvetua's death, the priest and guards in the hall lost control and began to frantically devour its flesh and blood.\nAt this point in time, the Beyonder characteristics had yet to appear completely. Kalvetua's body still contained a large part of it, and many guards had problems with a potion overdose or conflicting pathway characteristics. They broke down on the spot and died completely.\nHowever, there were always people who were lucky enough to survive the sudden death, or there were those who lost control of themselves and became disgusting monsters, or those who directly skipped a few Sequences and became a powerhouse, or those who became lunatics with distorted demonic powers due to the mixture of pathway characteristics.\nRegardless of which one it was, it was extremely dangerous!\nKlein looked down from the surviving priest's face to see his belly bulging like a pregnant woman's.\nA strong burgeoning and contraction appeared there, resembling a huge heart."}
