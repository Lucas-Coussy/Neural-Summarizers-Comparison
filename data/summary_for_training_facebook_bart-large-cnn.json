{"num_chp":704,"summary":"Alger Wilson stood in front of a window, considering the report he had to produce when he arrived at Pasu Island. It was at that moment when the endless gray fog and a figure lording over him appeared. Alger then saw a dark red glow and saw a blurry figure resembling The World. He then heard the figure's calm words. He found it difficult to suppress his joy as a strong sense of bewilderment and shock emerged within his heart. He remembered very clearly that The World had only promised The Sun to obtain the Notary potion formula within three days at the last Tarot Club gathering. He hadn't mentioned anything related to the Ocean Songster potion formula, but in just days, this gentleman had obtained the rare Sequence 5 formula and even its main ingredient!What did he do exactly? Alger muttered silently to himself as he couldn't help but recall Gehrman Sparrow's cold and formidable appearance. The man was more and more unfathomable. Alger fell into deep thought, depressed to realize that he didn't have any items or money of equal value. He quickly calmed his heart as he focused on another matter. He tried a divination on Groselle's Travels which he had brought above the gray fog. To his surprise, the divination ended in a failure. The book didn't appear special in any way, appearing so ordinary that only history fans would notice it. Klein knew very well that the Spectator pathway's Sequence 0 had long Klein's eyes spewed out with blood as his ears were left with two black holes. His mouth and nostrils had white matter stained with blood spew out from them. The scene quickly zoomed in as a palace with a height of over two hundred meters occupied Klein's vision. The space was so large that it allowed any dragon to move freely within. The \"camera\" kept moving inward, and soon, Klein saw a book made of yellowish-brown goatskin. Its cover was blank as it floated in midair. Compared to its surroundings, it was amazingly small. It was written by an ancient god, a storybook that can automatically deduce the ending. When this book was formed, the Dragon of Imagination likely hadn't encountered the ancient sun god and was fine. It just begs the question if the ancient gods are stronger than the real gods of the present day. After some consideration, he thought of finding a chance to enter the book in search for clues. Once I encounter any trouble, I'll immediately return. I have to be careful and cautious...Klein nodded as he divined that leaving Groselle's Travels above the gray fog would bring undesirable changes to the mysterious space, but was not sure if he actually knew why this was a place that transcended the spirit world. After deciding to take a look, Klein threw the junk pile into the pile so as to prevent any accidents, he took off. Klein handed over the elf queen's golden wine cup to Edwina. She habitually studied the engravings and symbols on the cup before withdrawing her gaze in embarrassment. She then looked out the window and said, \"They'll be organizing a bonfire party. Will you be participating?\" Klein shook his head. \"I don't plan on participating either. Not everyone is like Anderson, who can quickly raise his spirits,\" she said with pursed lips. \"Actually, it's not necessarily a bad thing...Klein was momentarily at a loss for a response. And apart from \"giving lessons,\" Edwine wasn't good at socializing\" \"Are you selling that key that originates from the giants?\" Klein silently inhaled and broke the silence. \"Yes.\" She added, \"I can lend it to you for studying. You can decide whether to buy it before leaving the ship.\" \"Put this in Siatas's tomb.\" \"I'm sorry, I don't know what to do with it,\" Klein said. \"It's in the captain's cabin. I'm not allowed to take it with me.\" \"You can take it if you want.\" \"No, I'm sorry. I can't take it.\" \"What do you want with it?\" Klein asked. \"Put it in Sia's tomb\" \"I'll take it when I get back to the ship\" \"Yes, I will,\" she replied."}
{"num_chp":801,"summary":"After a brief moment of stupefaction, Emlyn couldn't help but look around. He suspected that The World was lurking around him, as though he was one of the nearby believers. Emlyn was left in utter shock as he stood up and walked to the clergymen's break room at the back. In a quiet and empty environment, he replied, \"Honorable Mr. Fool, I wish to directly communicate with The World.\" In less than ten seconds, he saw a dark red glow surge forward like a tidal wave and devour him. He found himself inside the majestic palace and was seated at his seat. At the other end of the mottled table was the blurry-figure of The World who was waiting for him. The World said with a hoarse laugh, \"We might have met before.\" He didn't speak further and only mentioned the key point. As for whether Emlyn could figure out the situation, that wasn't his problem. He said, \"The rental fee will cost 300 pounds, as well as five pages of Beyonder powers in Leymano's Travels.\" He decided to outsource half of the debt he had to Emlyn. After closing the real deal, he immediately returned to the world and walked into the Harvest Church's breakroom for the clergyman's break for the Sunday service. He immediately fell into a dilemma. He had never tried borrowing similar items from the bishop. If it wasn't because Emlyn had been Bishop Utravsky gave Emlyn the Mental Terror Candle. Emlyn was stunned, finding it unbelievable that the bishop would agree so easily. He didn't immediately accept it as he couldn't help but ask, \"Aren't you afraid that I'll lose the candle?\" The bishop replied, \"Everyone and every item has its end. They will all return to the earth, buried deep within the soil and sprout, grow, and bloom, one incarnation after another\" Emlyn didn't delay, for he didn't wish to give his alternate personality a chance to grow. He wanted to resolve the problem completely while it was still weak; otherwise, what awaited him was the irreversible fate of losing control. He used the excuse of needing to treat his friend to leave the Harvest Church. He randomly found an inn and set up the sacrificial ritual. The mysterious space above the gray fog would completely screen the negative effects of the combat between the two personalities. The candle's wick was very short and was entirely black in color. It was covered in thin densely packed scale-like patterns. The surface was covered with what looked like human skin. There were a few warts that protruded out. He was another \"Klein\" with black hair, brown eyes, thin built, average-looking features, a rather deep outline, and a scholarly air to him. He appeared to have grown in strength, and he wasn't able to use the objects in the external world. Klein remained silent as he raised his Sea God Scepter-wielding right hand. Zhou Mingrui made the blue gems on the tip of the scepter light up one after another. \"Klein\" was already awash with tears as he yelled angrily and fearfully, \"I only wanted to remind you!\"Amidst shrill cries, the figure rapidly dissipated as a bolt of lightning wiped all traces of it. Then, he ultimately maintained his lucidity as he left the mind world. \"I've already come to know who I am. If I were to let you go, it would be equivalent to splitting the two up, admitting that they are opposing parties. That way, I'll immediately lose control once I return to the real world...Klein lowered the scpter and closed his eyes as he sighed silently. \"Let me go. Let me go... I have no ill intentions!\" he said. \"If I wasn't trying to reminding you, why would I have exposed myself!?\" he added. \"It would be like admitting that you are an opposing party!\" he exclaimed. \"That's what I'm trying to do!\" he replied. \"You're not the only one who has fused with Klein's memories and emotions. You're the one who's fused with my emotions and memories, too!\" \"I don't want to split you up. I want to keep you together!\""}
{"num_chp":1168,"summary":"Amon's projection subconsciously turned its head and looked in the direction of the palm. It saw the pus-covered, one-eyed giant who had long since died. The curse of the grayish-yellow fog kept emanating from \"His\" body. But it was different from before. There were seemingly illusory black tubes behind \"He\" back. They extended all the way into the infinite distance, a mystery as to what they were connected to. The \"Twilight Sword\" tore through the void and jumped out from the spot where the Angel of Time, Amon, was standing. It ripped through everything around it, turning into a storm that could destroy this desolate moor. But no matter how the orange-red \"sword\" storm raged, it didn't harm \"Him\" at all. The Evernight Goddess had come to a certain level of influence in the Land of the Gods, other than the True Creator. She could use the Uniqueness of the Death Goddess to exert a low degree of influence on some things in the Forsaken Land. The former Chief of the City of Silver was very likely related to Artificial Death. This explained something-that for some unknown reason, those that could influence the Forsaken Gods could be more powerful than the Creator. And now, Klein considered the Evernight in some ways!Based on this reasoning, Klein suspected that the Goddess could use this power to help him in his most desperate hour. Klein wasn't one of Amon's \"Parasites\" either. Amon wasn't aware of the former City of Silver Chief's abnormality involving the black illusory tubes. Klein had no idea what the final outcome would be. He had mostly focused his attention on the fact that Amon's avatar had been replaced by \"His\" true body. After completing this attack, Klein, who was high above the gray fog, immediately cut off the connection between Sefirah Castle and the real world. He then saw himself-glazed eyes, on the brink of losing control. He saw Amon's projection which had circled around the bluish-black palm using an \"error.\" He had finally succeeded in committing suicide. The entire gray fog boiled as the entirety of Sefire Castle quaked. A vast amount of terrifying power gathered over, transforming into a torrent of lightning. The blue gems that lit up at the same time sent an illuminating light that surged down like a torrent, drowning Amon's avatars and his own body. The black tubes didn't persist, and they instead shrank back into the depths of the darkness. Dressed in the classic black robe, Amon stood in a classic hat and pointed hat and said, \"I am the God of Combat, and I am here to kill you all.\" The black giant immediately began to rot, quickly being reduced to bones and reduced to a point that kept Bladel \"existing\" \"He\" raised \"His\" head and looked into the sky silently for a few seconds, as though he was looking at Sefirah Castle through the fog of history. He discovered that the Beyonder characteristics that had been destroyed with his body had unknowingly entered the Historical Void. It fused with the Worms of Spirit from the past, turning them corporeal. The miracle of \"resurrection\" was essentially a deeper use of one's strength from the future. The number of resurrections I'm using now is depleting the number I'll have after I become a Miracle Invoker... From the looks of it, there's only one chance now. Tsk... Amon should be guarding my \"corpse\" now. If it really doesn't work, I'll just abandon my body and become an undead! Klein's mind raced. The whole story's origins was when I was reading the Cthulhu myth. When I saw the line about the stars being right, I suddenly thought of this: We often say that Cthulhu will awaken soon, but what happens if Cthulhu has already awakened...? For those who don't know much about Cthulhu, it doesn't matter. Just treat this name as an evil god. After all, the corresponding deities were completely reconstructed by me. He's a very patient God of Mischief... Yes, my current state can only be maintained for three days. After that period of time, I won't be able to borrow powers from the Past to resurrect"}

As for why it went rabid and bit Hazel, he was unsure. He nodded slightly and tapped his chest four times in a clockwise fashion. \"May the Goddess bless her.\"After saying that, he walked past the host, entered the hall, and waited for the ball tonight to begin. The scene from before surfaces in the girl's mind as her blurry dream-like state gradually turned clear. She saw gray rats crawling out from the corner of her bedroom, balcony, and bed. All of them had dark red eyes but could only produce squeaking sounds. The more she looked, the more terrified she became. She had no idea what she would discover next, nor did she understand what the person was who created the dream to begin with. The only thing she was certain of was that the other party's level and strength in the supernatural domain far exceeded hers! This shattered what little pride she had left after she had been thrown into an illusion for nearly ten seconds. It was as though it wasn't her hand that was bitten but her heart. She was in a similar state, her entire being turbid and muddled. Her left hand was wrapped in thick bandages, but there weren't any more signs of blood. Her expression was heavy, nothing like her usual arrogance. Hazel was afraid to head to the manor and inform her teacher, but she was afraid of encountering danger and end up being sacrificed. Her teacher had seemingly lost the ability to communicate. To go from North Borough's B\u00f6klund Street to Macht's manor in Backlund's northwestern suburbs would take three to five hours on carriage. Klein had used Tinder before and had some idea about the powers of the Marauder pathway. He suspected that Hazel, who had an item of a higher level, could \"steal\" the flight abilities of birds and use that short period of time to cross the river. This way, she might arrive within three hours.Regardless, I'll be faster than her... Klein retracted his gaze and began considering who his next dance partner should be. \"I'm a little tired. I plan on sleeping now. Don't let anyone disturb me,\" Hazel said to her lady's maid outside. \"Yes, my lady,\" the maid immediately replied. \"You're not a likable girl, she has quite a kind heart... Klein nodded indiscernibly and praised her inwardly. He had already noticed Hazel's actions thanks to his intuition. He wasn't worried about her actions, because to go from B\u00f6Klund Street. to Machsmanor in the northwestern suburbs of Backlund. It was inevitable to spend five hours traveling. At night, there were only three bridges to consider, and they were all under the Tussock Red-eyed rats ran out from the roof beams, storage cabinets, and all kinds of miscellaneous. Klein could control as many as 50 marionettes, a number that would rise once he finished digesting the potion. The rats reflected into his eyes as Klein pulled the human-skinned glove on his left hand, casting his gaze towards the flowerbed in the manor. He was none other than Gehrman Sparrow, the Bizarro Sorcerer's marionette. He left the ball ahead of time, returned to Dwayne Dant\u00e8s's residence and entered his bedroom. Then, he teleported over with Winner Enuni and the latter had been left outside theManor to allow for any instantaneous switches in positions. The result was that the two men were able to take control of a large number of rats at once. They had to fight their way through the rats to get to the other side of the house, which was guarded by a large group of maids. They were eventually able to defeat the rats, but they had to wait until the next day to find out what had happened to the man who had won the ball the night before. The man was later revealed to be a former member of the Royal Family, who had died in a car crash in the early hours of the morning. He had been killed by a rat that had been bitten by Miss Hazel, one of the maids who had been at the ball."}

He followed Rogo Colloman into a spacious and bright living room. There was a huge crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling. The walls, corners, and tables were decorated with all kinds of golden carvings and ornaments. The entire area looked gorgeous, exquisite, and luxurious. However, the boy was wrapped in a thick fur coat and had a blanket that looked burning hot on his legs. At that moment, he had his head low, tightly hugging himself as he shivered nonstop. His dark blue hair seemed to have lost its luster. The color of Adol's aura had been dyed with a deep blackish-green sheen! This is a sign of being haunted by wraiths. Or perhaps, there were no such things as \"bad company\" at all...Klein quietly reached out, held Mr. Azik's copper whistle, and allowed his spirituality to spread. Then, he thoughtfully looked away from Adol and looked at the others inside theliving room. By the oriel window stood a man in a black coat. He was tall and sturdy, not smiling, and his waist was bulging as if he were hiding a gun. This should be one of the six bodyguards... Klein was about to size up another Klein and Stuart, a young man with a full beard, went to their rooms on the second floor. After dinner, you guys have some rest and take over your shifts in the early morning,\" Kaslana added. Adol sat in the rocking chair, holding onto Azik's copper whistle, quietly watching his ward. The two of them had arrived at their destination and entered their respective rooms. The sound of a gunshot rang out, and without thinking, Stuart rolled over, while KasLana and Lydia quickly got off the sofa, each finding a place to hide. The only thing left in his coat was herbal powder, extract essence, keys, and his wallet. There were a total of 206 pounds in paper bills in his wallet, and he was carrying a black cane. He had already transferred the paper figurines, notes, charms, a matchbox, etc to his trouser pockets. He was about the same age as Lydia, and almost as tall as Klein, a little over 1.7m and weighing 140lb. Stuart had an armpit holster, and in it, there was obviously a specially designed revolver. He patted his clothes with great interest, got up and asked, \"Why haven't I heard of you, Mr. Moriarty? I mean, I know a lot of people in the detective business, but I've not heard about you in the past.\" \"I only came to Backlund in early September,\" Klein briefly explained Stuart sipped his coffee at his desk while waiting for Adol to wake up. As time passed, a cold chill swept through the room. Adol's face seemed paler, and his lips were turning purple. Stuart was about to speak when he saw Sherlock Moriarty stand up and nod at him. \"I'll follow him.\" Stuart let out a sigh of relief and followed him to the entrance of the washroom two rooms away. He saw a young man standing a few steps away. The man was wearing a white shirt, dark trousers, and a pair of gold-rimmed glasses. He was leaning against the wall with a smile on his face. The figure in the mirror was so pale that it looked like a corpse. He turned around and glared at Klein's left hand, at the delicate copper whistle that was being tossed up and down. He continued smiling and snapped his fingers. With a loud bang, a flame rose from the ground, igniting an invisible figure. It struggled for a few moments before completely dispersing. The flames extinguished as a result, and the figure was no longer visible to the public. \"What happened to you?\" Stuart asked Adol in a soft, dreamy voice. \"It's been a long nightmare for me,\" Adol replied. \"And I'm not going to let you out of my sight.

Klein, in his black double-breasted frock  coat and matching half top hat, had merely circled the bar once before  he walked to the nearest street as though he were on a stroll. As he walked out of the alley, a carriage stopped in front of him. Behind the glass window was Maric's pair of brown eyes which were  still suppressing any signs of malicious intent. He sat down and straightened his bow tie like a gentleman attending a banquet. He handed the three sedatives to Maric. Maric looked at the sealed and transparent glass test tube, gently  shaking the liquid inside and said, \"Two and a half. Any more and I will  really be sedated. I wouldn't do anything for a short period of time.\" Klein praised and turned to look at Sharron. \"Have you guys decided on the ambush spot?\"Sharron nodded. \"We're on the way there.\"She didn't directly reveal the intended location to Klein. He pondered for a moment, and he asked again after some deliberation, \"Do you feel the power of purification and exorcism now?\" \"No,\" Maric replied hoarsely. \"Very good,\" Klein replied. \"The Sun Brooch, is indeed able to isolate the effects of this spirituality cage from a wall of spirituality.\" Klein asked, \"Do they have any other mystical  items or Beyonder weapons besides the Scarlet Lunar Corona?\" Maric pinched his glabella, looking a bit irritated. \"Even if they have mystical items, they would lack the reason to use them.\" \"Unless it's something passive,\" added Maric. \"But to a Werewolf,  their claws are their Beyonder weapon. It's the same for me, Tyre, and Jason. It can tear through steel and comes with venom.\" \"Alright, I have no more questions,\" said Klein. \"We'll go and lure the enemy over.

The paper figurine he had left between the two warehouses stood up and transformed into a gentleman wearing a black double-breasted frock coat, a silk half top hat, and was holding a hard cane. The gentleman's position was rather remote and hidden, making it  difficult for anyone who came in from the outside to notice him. The enemy was a Sequence 5 wielding a mystical item! There was also a Sequence 6 and Sequence 7! Is this the state every magician is in before he goes onstage? Klein took a silent breath, suppressing his emotions and the heat of his body. His vision wasn't affected in any way, and he could clearly see the road that led to the clearing. The crimson moon was constantly obscured by the clouds, and there was only a glimmer of light in the clearing, but Klein saw three figures rapidly approaching.

She had to go to Chancellor Moment's office today to prepare for the upcoming mechanical laboratory that was to be officially launched. She felt that life on campus was so wonderful and that her classmates were so adorable. Suddenly, a metallic gray object descended from the sky and landed in the middle of the square. The steam locomotive's head was already in pieces, its components and fragments were scattered everywhere. The students around it, and those passing by, had already collapsed to the ground, their bodies no longer intact. They were no longer breathing. Some of them were covered in blood, others charred. There were some moaning in pain. The scene was like an oil painting that wasn't realistic enough. Melissa stared at it in a daze, momentarily at a loss for a reaction. She was only 16 years old after all-she had never experienced such a scene before. She fled in panic, not knowing what had happened. The teachers rushed to rescue the injured and evacuate the students that had been caught in the blast. It was only when many rushed out of the block and started to rescue them that Melissa woke up from her trance and moved closer to the teachers. They hurriedly split up into two groups, one to head to Tiffany Cathedral and the other to hide in an underground area that you can hide in. One of the teachers wore a look of terror, but he still held his There's no danger here. There's an underground area that you can hide in. The subway probably hadn't stopped moving.

Dwayne Dant\u00e8s said that he encountered ghosts when he was in the Southern Continent. He and his companions suddenly woke up in the middle of the night and found themselves unable to open their eyes. Their bodies were heavy, as though someone was pressing on them. They frantically left the town after the sun rose. The stories he told were sourced from one of Anderson's experiences. He didn't want Trissy to be in the vicinity any longer, wishing that she could recover and take action. He had already decided to send the iron cigarette down the sewers to check the area to confirm that Trissy's condition was fine. He also didn't wish to cause any trouble as his identity as Senor Dwayne Klein was still a secret. He made the marionette appear within the full-body case and opened the case to confirm his identity. Trissy appeared in the case and said, \"I am Trissy, the Demoness of the Sun. I need items or charms in the Sun domain... I need to find out if you are still alive or not.\" Trissy then disappeared into the darkness. Klein made the marionette in the ancient triangular hat leap onto the street lamp's surface before passing through the manhole cover in a Wraith form. He quickly approached the hidden fork where Trissy hid herself at. Trissy had her luscious black hair cascading down, unlike peers her age who had different hairstyles. She looked like a dreamy flower that was silently blooming in the night. Klein made Senor ask, \"Why do you say that?\" Trissy's gaze swept over the Wraith's face and said, \"It's said that Admiral of Blood is someone who indulges in his desires, and he has no resistance towards beautiful females and males\" She paused as she slightly narrowed her slender eyes. \"I'm afraid of finding myself lost to Pleasure and ending up being controlled by you.\" This was indeed one of the reasons why she had raised the topic. Klein actively ignored the topic and made the Marionette say, \"You're seeking out the target tomorrow? After all, the royal captain knows you like what you look like.\" Trissy lowered her head and looked at her toes before chuckling at her head. \"Rest at ease, I have the perfect plan at ease. It has signs of prolonged human activity. It's set off from here, at the end of the sixth left fork is a hidden passage. If you need to relieve yourself, just go to the washroom.\" Heh heh, I discovered it while walking around in the past few days. He made Senor smile and say, \"Did you discover anything?\" Trissy shook her head. \"There was nothing at all. Perhaps only a certain pathway, or someone with a specific item, can find the clues.\" Perhaps a Marauder's intuition, or something on Hazel's person? Klein didn't make Senor continue on the topic as he pressed his hand to his chest and bowed with a smile. \"Since you've recovered, I can be at ease.\" The moment he said that, he suddenly vanished. Trissy focused her eyes into a stare, but it was to no avail. Only when the invisible threads she had released was hit by a breeze did she retract her gaze, confirming that Admiral of Blood had really left the manhole. Fors woke up naturally on a Sunday morning as she got up to wash up. As she chewed on a fresh piece of toast, she retrieved a stack of items from her mailbox. She flipped through the items and discovered a reply letter she had been looking forward to. Fors quickly read through the letter as she muttered in surprise. She saw the toast in her mouth plunge to the ground. The reply letter said, \"Teacher is already in Backlund?\" Fors quickly tore open the envelope and saw that it was a letter from Hazel. The letter said that Hazel had been sent to Backlund to be Hazel's teacher."}

Only when it was late at night and his confirmation that Admiral of Stars and crew didn't have any intention of attacking him did he move the mystical item into a black suitcase. Sadly, he ended up falling sick. His body wasn't in a weakened state, so his resulting illness wasn't anything serious. He just felt his tonsils swell in pain. Cattleya, who was walking slowly behind, saw this scene, but she didn't find it a problem. Instead, she found it normal. It was common knowledge for knowledgeable Beyonders that mystical items were bound to have negative side effects. They would learn from the seven orthodox Churches and categorize those with serious side effects which made them impossible to possess or use for prolonged time as Sealed Artifacts. To most Beyonders, the disadvantages surpassed the advantages. She discovered that Gehrman Sparrow had used mystical items, Beyonder weapons, and spirituality charms to arm himself to the teeth. While being amazed, she was already guessing at the type of negative effects he was facing. From what she saw today, it was a temporary simple illness. Nina was taken aback, somewhat at a loss for a response to continue the conversation. She had originally planned on asking Gehrman Sparrow if she was lacking in charm, or ask if he was the cold type. But considering how the man standing before her was a powerful guy, an adventurer who nearly successfully hunted Vice Admiral Ailment, or a lunatic who could draw his gun and shoot at any moment, she rationally held back her jesting words. \"Captain, do we begin now?\" Nina asked as she leaped into the sea, swimming downwards like a gigantic black fish.

As expected of a Beyonder from the Sailor pathway...Klein looked out the ship as he couldn't help but cough. \"You're sick?\" Frank Lee asked directly. \"A little.\" Klein nodded slightly and said, \"Very good.\" Frank thought for a moment. He didn't say a word as he rushed back into the cabin; his destination unknown. \"In another day, we will be leaving the whaling sea route.\" Klein thought. \"But we're at least a week from those waters?\" Klein thought before asking. \"That is a secret and I wish to allow more round and be more round\" Cattleya looked at Klein's eyes through her thick glasses, as she wanted to tell how much he knew of extremely dangerous waters. Klein looked at the Poison Expert and said frankly, \"It's healed.\" Frank didn't praise himself as he began casually introducing the pirates on the deck. After a while, Nina and the other supporting sailors swam up to the surface and returned to the ship. Cattleya held a metallic piece that had been rotten into an identifiable state and a piece of black hardened mud that was filled with honeycombed holes. She grumbled, \"Captain, there's no deep-sea well! That well's mouth isn't even bigger than my breasts! It's unknown what's hidden in it.\" She gestured using her hands. \"Exaggeration is a common trait of pirates and adventurers.\" Cattlya nodded without using the term \"bragging\" \"Go into the details.\" Klein said. \"I have to say that it's rather magical... As long as it doesn't involve animals and humans, Frank Lee is really a genius that should be taken seriously in the Church of Mother Earth. Unfortunately, he ultimately became a devil-like person... I'm afraid I'll end up even sicker after eating it... \" He then bit down at the apple. It had the taste of a normal apple, but had a lot more juice, and the insides were softer.

But the price she paid was to personally seal her father, the father she had missed and sought for more than a hundred years. Her hatred for her father had completely dissipated, but it also added to her guilt. She was willing to bury the pain in the deepest part of her heart and not let it affect her mental state. She knew that what she needed at this moment wasn't sorrow, nor corny emotions, but determination and the will to forge forward. She firmly raised her right hand and drew out ancient words that shimmered with a stellar radiance in the void. She summoned the spirit world creature who was half-man, half-wind, and she retrieved the Sage supplementary ingredients from it. The entire Dawn, as well as the surrounding winds, storms, lightning, seawater, and waves, all lost their sense of reality.

The Snake of Fate's blood wasn't a premonition, Cattleya believed that the dream she had had was without any reason. Queen Mystic Bernadette walked out of the spirit world and returned to Dawn, allowing the ship to gradually distance itself from the nameless island. Cattleya immediately heaved a sigh of relief and sincerely thanked Mr. Fool, hoping that this mighty existence would give her some hints or to protect the Queen. She put on her heavy glasses and walked along the resplendent bridge of starlight to the deck where she proceeded to stroll leisurely in the quiet night. When she arrived at the bow of the ship, she saw Frank Lee tinkering with bottles. He planned on informing the Evernight Goddess in the form of a prayer of the hidden dangers of the Card of Blasphemy. He didn't want the Earth Mother, Lilith, to obtain the Mother card or The Moon Card. After sealing them, he immediately returned to the real world and headed for the nearest Evernight cathedral. \"This will bring me plenty,\" Frank said with a look of anticipation, \"When I have my next vacation, I'd like to go to the depths of the North Sea or the poles where it's a world of ice and snow.

He decided to take a day off from his \"visits\" on Saturday and Sunday to his schedule. He also decided to have a few days to think it over before making a decision. He was told to go to Cherwood Borough, 15 MKK, on Monday morning. He arrived at Cherwood at 8:30 a.m. and was met by his kinsmen, who were waiting for him on the second floor of the palace. He told them that he was going to the palace to make a decision about his assignment, and that he would be back in a few hours. He then went to a black iron coffin and waited for Emlyn to come out. He waited until he was sure that Emlyn had left the room, and then went back to his room to make the decision. The decision was made to send Emlyn back to the first floor, where he was waiting for his brother Cosmi Odora to come back from work. The next day, Emlyn was sent to the third floor to make his choice, and Cosmi followed him. Klein had planned to put up with it for two days since he was \"leaving\" Backlund, but in his free time, he didn't dare to take the time to head to the Quelaag Club to have fun. He was afraid of infuriating Prince Edessak, so he could only stay home. Klein busied himself from eight to eleven before barely completing his desired cleanup. The old butler was wearing a well-cut tuxedo, and said, \"Detective Moriarty, His Highness, the Prince, is waiting for you in the carriage at the end of the street. He wishes to know the progress of your investigations\" Klein quickly reorganized what he had thought of last night and calmly replied, \"Alright.\" He was about to remove his hat from the coat rack when he felt a sudden ache in his stomach, a pain that required him to visit the toilet. \"I'm very sorry. I'll need to use the bathroom first. My stomach isn't feeling well,\" he said. \"That's your freedom,\" said the old Butler. \"You can go to Red Rose Manor tomorrow or the afternoon of the day after tomorrow,\" Klein replied. \"It hasn't even been ten minutes, and I'd already done it as fast as I could...

Don't worry, there won't be any problems.\" She pulled back her hair, revealing her long, white neck. She slowly applied various things to her face, making her look even more alluring. She tightened her belt to make herself look thinner, then she lazily stretched and yawned while covering her mouth. \"I'm going to pay a visit to Mr. A of the Aurora Order. I hope he's as crazy as the rumors say,\" she said. \"You don't need to remind me,\" the middle- aged man with deep blue eyes to the point of being black said with a straight face. \"Be careful of the quill in your hand, you almost exchanged bodies with someone the last time,\" the woman said.

The island wasn't far from the Southern Continent, but it didn't belong there geographically. If the ritual were to create a huge commotion, it was possible for some effective screening. He didn't panic. Instead, he calmly got his other marionette to throw page after page of the ancient historical records into the blob of thick, dark mist. After \"digesting\" the historical records, it finally fell back into the cauldron, like water vapor, turning into something that coexisted as both a liquid and a gas. The moment the two supplementary ingredients came into contact with each other, a thin mist immediately rose up. It enveloped the container and was about half the height of a person and an arm wide. It began to contract and expand, as though it was alive, like a slowly-beating heart. After staring at the topaz pendant spinning rapidly in a counterclockwise direction for a few seconds, he pulled up the silver chain and wrapped it around his left wrist. He cast his gaze at the potion floating in a cauldron as thoughts flashed across his mind: A Bizarro Sorcerer's acting not only has the key terms of \"fear,\" \"horror,\" \"directing,\" and \"plicable,\" also some level of mystery, unknown, complicated, and unpredictable aspects of fate Klein's skin suddenly turned transparent as maggots that contained three-dimensional symbols crawled out. The potion instantly transformed and extended into Klein's mouth, making him feel like he was devouring a dark red glow. As he gradually lost consciousness and his body slowly descended, he tried his best to find something that could confirm his identity. With a thought, he followed his intuition and flew over in a manner that seemed to travel the cosmos. He was stored in a transparent cocoon as he swayed gently. He looked like the original Zhou Mingrui. This had nothing to do with his surroundings. This prevented him from getting lost!Following a similar spot of light, he began to fly deeper into the grayish-white fog. Along the way, he discovered that the surrounding fog was scattered with fragments of light. It can be considered as me effectively acting ahead of time. I can definitely avoid many dangers. I couldn't see this before when I used the Yesterday charm, but I can actually do so now... In other words, during the advancement process, I can indirectly influence the Sefirah Castle above the gray fog? Wait, I think has been restored? Klein's ability to eliminate the interference of the ritual could provide himself to become a clear definition of the definition of Yore. But after becoming Klein, I've experienced too many things in the past year. I've already left a mark in the present era. Fortunately, it hasn't even been two Klein knew bits of history that he knew of the Fifth Epoch. As he passed through them, he naturally split his consciousness and completed an invisible connection, making his definition of his own identity even clearer. The more he proceeded forward, the more relaxed he felt. He felt like he was about to fly up from running down a runway. A group of terrifying canine-like creatures with dark red eye sockets appeared beside him. They ran around the indiscernible bottom of the gray fog as they followed him by his side as if they were accompanying and guarding him. Finally, Klein stopped in front of a lonely fragment of light. Inside was a withered forest and a normal-sized tomb. He didn't care about his current state, and he subconsciously looked up into the sky. He directly saw the grayish-white fog and the ancient majestic palace above thegray fog. He connected his consciousness to his origin and he suddenly plummeted into the cauldron in the middle of the fog. The mysterious space was trembling slightly. It was unknown where the other fragments of light were floating. The history of the Dual Era and the Early Era of Fire swept past him from behind, pointing out the path that led forward. He could've turned around a long time ago and returned to the real world. However, he didn't stop and continued flying forward. His expression was filled with anticipation.

She was very pleased with how quickly Klein obtained information on Doragu Gale's mistress, as well as her photo. Mary's father was a co-founder of the Coim Company and had a 20 percent stake. The company was originally just a small company that barely made money, but as the demand for anthracite and charcoal increased, the company rapidly expanded to become one of the top ten companies in the capital's industry. As such, Mary's net worth skyrocketed. The club now has 192 members. The food and wine can use a buffet, library, squash room, conference room, and card room, all for free. There are two tennis courts on the lawn, totally free of charge, and you only need to pay the corresponding rental fee of underground ranges. If you aren't satisfied with the simple buffet, you can order the simple ala carte.

They aren't occupied as long as they aren't as long occupied as they don't need to be\" The club's distinctive badge, named for its founding in early November, corresponded to the month of the Frost constellation.

He was shown around and given a lounge to take an afternoon nap. While he was there, he divined that he would be in danger in the next few days. He could only assume that this was the prelude to danger. He returned to the real world and went to the Hillston branch of the Backlund Bank to withdraw the remaining 1000 pounds from his account. Without the account being synchronized, there was theoretically speaking a loophole to seize the opportunity when all accounts were out of sync. However, this was only in theory to avoid similar acts, the rules on anonymous accounts had many rules on similar acts. He left the bank and went back to his hotel, where he was waiting for Ian to arrive. He then went to his room and fell into a deep sleep, but woke up when he heard Ian's voice saying, \"Klein, I've been waiting for you for a long time, haven't I?\" He then fell into an even deeper sleep, and when he woke up, he was in a different room, but it was the same as the one he had been in before. He felt the air around him turn still, as if it were the calm before the storm. His heart suddenly palpitated as he tensed up. His reaction just now really was an omen that danger is coming...Klein narrowed his eyes and leaned back in his chair. First, it was to enhance the transmission of similar information in the same city; second, it. was to limit a single withdrawal to no more than 500 pounds, and third, if the last withdrawal wasn't done locally, a telegram was needed to inquire about it. Today, Klein encountered the third situation. Under Kaspars's guidance, he saw Maric sitting in the card room. Maric stuffed the 100 pounds into his pocket and said indifferently, \"You can return now. She has begun protecting you, in a hidden way.\" If I hadn't divined this beforehand, I would definitely think of all of you as cheats... Klein surveyed his surroundings and deliberately acted as though he left with clenched teeth. Back at 15 Minsk Street, Klein closed the door, went into the bathroom, turned on the tap, and washed his hands. He then saw himself phasing away in the mirror before transforming into a woman wearing a black regal dress. The woman had light golden hair and blue eyes. She looked very delicate but her face was abnormally pale. She wore a small black bonnet, lifted her skirt, and bowed at Klein. He turned back in surprise only to see the wall and nothing but air.

They were suspended in midair, motionless. Black ravens circled the top of the cathedral, letting out heart-stopping cries. The two marionettes' necks suddenly tightened as they were lifted up by an invisible hand before being hung up in the cathedral's interior. In Memorial Square, the \"imagined\" King George III was still giving a speech. He was the demigod who supported George III, Prince Grove.

I shouldn't have taken your faith as a joke.\" Klein wiped away the fake expression he put on and smiled. \"Our differences in faith do not prevent us from becoming friends.\" He then changed the subject. \"Did you see Will Auceptin again? I'm referring to the kid that had one of his legs amputated, the one who said that your luck would turn for the worse.\" He was certain that the Nighthawks would follow the clues provided by Aaron, so he wondered what the outcome was. He was curious if the child who changed Aaron's luck still had the tarot card in his possession. Klein decided to head for the underground shooting range, familiarizing himself with his free revolver with ordinary bullets. Mary's maid and her bodyguard were left in the reception hall. They were all wearing relatively light skirts, making them look much younger. Compared to Mary, Stelyn was clearly much prettier, but towards this lady, she seemed very respectful and docile. Klein was sitting at his desk, watching as the crimson moon gradually pierced through the clouds, revealing a full body. The water-like, light red \"veil\" slowly spread out, and time passed by the minute. When it was quarter past ten, he heard illusory pleas that seemed layered. In a split-second, the hazy figure of Fors appeared on the chair with the symbol of a layered door.

The silence quickly transformed into the main theme. Within the towering palace which looked Best-selling novel writer, Fors had mastered the art of rambling. She had used her own experience to prove that the \"curse\" only existed in the bloodline. She gave Klein the formula and told him to watch her body after she died and take away the glowing object that would suddenly appear. After using it once, the full moon's raving became worse. Although she didn't believe she could become a High-Sequence Beyonder, she believed in Mr. Fool. It was Monday again, and as soon as Klein got up, he went downstairs and saw an open sheet of paper on the coffee table in the living room. He immediately let out a sigh of relief. He promptly went above the gray fog to \"prepare\" for the new Tarot Club gathering. The meeting was to take place at 3:30 p.m., and Klein was the guest of honor.

He had shaved his hair, and with a sea eagle tattoo, he cursed, \"Dogsh*t Navy sailor!\" The Navy sailor didn't yield to him, and both sides fully illustrated the rich profanities of the sea.

After some thought, she gave a description in a serious manner. \"Not far from the iron ruins, I found a well. It's not very big. If it's to be described with the word \u2018huge,' then I've definitely seen plenty of huge cannons. Even a child from Nas wouldn't be able to enter the well. Humans are unable to enter it, but that doesn't mean that non-humans can't do it! There's a chance that they can pass through the well,\" she said. Cattleya nudged her glasses and said to Nina, \"You can drink a bottle of Sonia blood wine. There's no limit for the rest of the captain's life!\" Long live the captain, Nina cried out in joy. \"Klein, who had no desire to explore it, had a strange idea, but there's no rush to make marine do his bidding while wielding the scepter!\" The way she wavered made all the surrounding pirates stare straight at her. \"As the \"Sea had the God,\" he said, \"Sea means to make creatures do God's bidding while he had the power to make them do it!\" The pirates agreed. \"Aye aye, Captain!\" The wet Nina was trembling as a result of the cold winds. Michele Deuth received a letter from the daughter of the richest aristocratic family in East Chester County. She was Miss Audrey Hall, who was deemed to be the most stunning gem in Backlund. With the powers of Clown, he forcefully maintained his indifferent expression. He didn't react abnormally in any way as he entered the cabin normally as though nothing had happened. The windows were tightly shut and the curtains were drawn. There were a pair of blurry eyes hidden behind them, silently watching the crowd on the deck, as well as Gehrman Sparrow. He was wearing a long tailcoat and a beautiful bow tie as he waited by the door. Michele found his confidence as the master of his master's collection and began pointing at the White Rose helmet that appeared in the White War helmet. He felt as though the flowers in the garden had instantly faded. He took two steps forward and took off his hat and said, \"Your visit is an honor for my family.\"Audrey followed him into the living room and entered the collector's room on the first floor. She then pointed at the collection on the left and said: \"This is a helmet that appears in a White War Helmet that appeared on the White war helmet. This is the collection of the Hermit, Michele Deuth, who is an outstanding collector and an aficionado of this domain. Let's see if Ma'am Hermit is able to figure out anything from these two objects\" After lots of research, it can be determined that the owner is a member of the Sauron family. Back then, they were still considered royalty. The golden helmet had an intricate design. There were avian and flying wings that adorned it, and the visor was formed from pieces of golden scales. The knight's name has already vanished in the long rivers of history. This notebook is the only proof of his existence. He once stood fast until the very last moment on Sonia Island. He doesn't particularly treasure it... I have a high chance of purchasing it...Audrey calmly made a judgment as she turned her head. She then smiled at Michele Deuth and said, \"What are the uncommon habits exactly?\" Michele described in a flaunting tone. \"Enjoys using short sentences-very simple and short ones...\" Audrey replied with piqued interest. \"The White Rose War happened after the Twenty Year War and before the Battle of the Violated Oath. There, Loen defeated Intis and became strong again.\" Audrey was always a good listener. She looked at him with a smile as she listened with focused attention. This made Michele speak more. \"This notebook is not only a first-hand account for the research of that portion of history, but it also hides certain problems. The Knight's grammar has many uncommon habits. This might be a clue to aid us in determining his exact identity.\" Audrey instinctively believed that the notebook was her target."}

Hmm, the description of omnipotence is a little strange...Audrey stole a glance at The Hanging Man subconsciously and realized that he was nodding slightly. He purposely chuckled and asked in reply, \"Even though He abandoned you?\" The Creator abandoned the City ofSilver?Alger was shocked. Suddenly when he suddenly made the connection regarding a particular term. The Forsaken Land of the Gods. This is a hidden place that the Church of the Lord of Storms has been trying to find to no avail. Only the leader of the church knew something about the situation and seemed to be taking charge of the hidden mission to look for the place. The Fool was shocked and surprised to find that the Tarot Club member using The Sun as his code name was very likely from the\u00a0Forsaken\u00a0Land of the\u00a0Gods. He could pull someone from there to be a member of the Gathering. \"We were once ruled by the giants' royal family, and we worshiped the Giant King Aurmir. Later, we were saved by the Lord and we will never betray the Lord again,\" Derrick Berg answered in an uncertain tone. \"Yes, we believe that we will regain the Lord's favor in the end. Perhaps, it will be on the day the sun rises again\" Klein asked, \"Do you still offer sacrifices to this omnipotent God?\" Alger said, \"Yes, we still do. But since the day we were abandoned, we have never gotten any response.\" Derrick's voice had a hint of unconcealed pain. \"We build opulent altars covered in the Lord's symbol. Every time we receive a bumper Black-Faced Grass harvest, we hold a sacrificial ritual. After we recite God's honorable title and the necessary prayers, we dance for Him and then kill the monsters, to let their spirituality and tainted blood dye the entire altar\" Alger felt a shock through his body and he quivered. This was because he felt he was being made privy to the secrets between deities! That made him feel like he had been elevated to a whole new level! \"We pray for you to take the gates of your Kingdom to open to your offerings,\" Derrick said. \"In the end, we sing praises in unison and end the ritual.\" Alger leaned back, lifted his chin, and got carried away with his thoughts. \"After the Qilangos commission is over, I'll pay the price to get information about what Mr. Hanged Man learned today... I wonder if he would be willing to...Audrey thought in anticipation, yet was still a little worried. \"I've been chasing after power, after strength. Didn't I do it to achieve this kind of feeling?\" How could the secrets of a deity be revealed directly to a mortal? Derrick also steeled his resolve to quickly grow in power, so that he could obtain something that could garner Mr. Fool's interest in exchange for his guidance. After some more communication, Klein ended the gathering. He watched Justice's, The Hanged Man's, and The Sun's figures vanish before him. He looked down and saw the boundless gray fog and crimson stars that seemed eternally immutable. After he advanced to Sequence 8, he realized he could connect even more stars. In other words, he could pull in more members. At least two...Klein nodded indiscernibly. He wasn't in a hurry to add new members. He would first wait and observe. If Justice and The Hanging Man had any recommendations, he would ask them first. What I saw the last few times was when The Sun was praying. There was a clear crystal ball before him, but ever since I pulled him into the world above the gray fog, that crystal ball has never appeared again. Does the prerequisite needed to pull people in through the connection of the crimson star have something to do with having a special item around them? Or does every crimson star correspond to an item in reality, which, when it's connected successfully, it would return to the world below. I can give it a try in the future. I wonder what I'll conjure this time..."}

The figure in the mirror was clear, but it was as though the woman in the black regal dress had never appeared. The copper whistle was buried with me, but the corpses surrounding me didn't act abnormally. Was it because those buried in the cemetery have experienced a send off by the priests and bishops? When does it work and when doesn't it? When this business with the ambassador is over, and if I'm still alive, I'll go to the cemetery and try to figure out the scope of its effect and its limits. I can't always carry a time bomb like this...Klein washed his face and walked out of the bathroom. Just as he picked up the newspaper in the living room and was going to read it, he heard the doorbell ring. Ian Wright came to apologize for involving him in such a dangerous matter. He was a spy for the Feysac Empire. He adopted several vagrant children and taught them how to gather intelligence. I was involved in a huge spy conspiracy... I was often ignored by the others, allowing us to gather a lot of useful information. Ian had a calmness that was beyond his age. Two weeks ago, I stumbled upon clues regarding Helmosuin's manuscript.\" Klein found the name familiar. Ian looked up at him and explained, \"Turani von Helmosquin, the greatest scientist after Emperor Roselle, a mathematician, a mechanist, and the father of the second generation difference machine.\"So it's him! Klein suddenly remembered the relevant information. He wasn't only a great scientist, but also a crazy scientist. He believed that the inherent flaw in the existence of humans could only be fixed through machines. He was an important figure that every country was trying to find. He mysteriously disappeared while researching a third generation difference machines. The Zmanger gang tried to capture me...\"With your help, I confirmed the death of Detective Zreal. I took a fake tooth from his corpse.\" He then went on to recount what had happened. \"I got in touch with Detective Z real's superior in Backlund via telegram and arranged the time, place, and manner of meeting, but soon enough, I was found by the Zmangers\" He then told Klein about the Mid-Sequence Beyonder of the Seer pathway. \"The situation is extremely peculiar.\" He said, \"I was once again ambushed With powerful mediumship, it was impossible for the fake tooth to not be discovered. Zreal was exposed and killed when he obtained the clue to the manuscript, as well as why you were ambushed. It was because the Intis ambassador had information about Zreal's superior which was why he didn't pay much attention to the urgent communication method inscribed on the inside of the tooth. Z real's report to his superior directly led to his demise!Ian fell into a daze when he heard that. It took him quite a while before he clenched his fists in anger, trying hard to compose himself as he said, \"I didn't think of that. You really are an excellent detective...\" He quietly let out a breath of air and changed the topic. \"Sorry to have involved you in this. Actually, you don't need to hide anything for me.\" He smiled and said, 'No, the main problem in this matter was because I made a mistake that made me end up in my current situation.\" He then stood up and gave a deep bow. \"Please allow me to apologize again. I'm sorry for what I've done to you and your family. I'll try to make it up to you soon.\" I had to plan for the worst case scenario in advance, and if I only reacted when the ambassador took action, it would definitely be too late. Whether it's an assassination, finding a bodyguard, or buying items, all of them will require time. Only if the ambassador and his assistant dies or attention is diverted to the investigation of his death will I be able to resolve this latent danger. His assistant doesn't have an official status, so he can't interact with the officials. For a mere Sequence 9 or Sequence 8 at best, someone whose whereabouts are unknown, there's no reason to go through the effort to report me. Once this matter is completely resolved, exposing my identity as a Beyonder would no longer be that dangerous. Of course, I'll have to get used to wearing glasses and a mustache in the future. In the future when they ask me about me, they will only think of this new image. This is the first time in my two lifetimes combined that I've ever been a fugitive. I'll need to disappear for a while; otherwise, I might be thrown into jail.\" Ian put on his hat, bade farewell, and left. He didn't stop him, watching him disappear into the crimson moonlight"}
{"num_chp":371,"summary":"\"No, it's just good luck. God was watching over me.\" Klein modestly stepped aside and invited Stuart in. Long before Stuart had accepted the mission, he already knew of Emlyn White's whereabouts. Stuart stood in front of the burning fireplace for twenty seconds before he sat down on the sofa. He looked at Klein, who was busy brewing instant coffee, and he said, \"I'm going south for a holiday to go fishing at Desi Bay for new year's. What about you? Do you have any vacation plans? We put up with Backlund's air for a year and work hard to save money, all for such a holiday.\" Stuart continued without end, \"We still aren't rich enough, otherwise I'd like to travel to Feysac, Intis, and even to the Southern Continent.\" After he finished making the coffee, Klein handed the man a white porcelain cup. Stuart took two deep breaths of the fragrant and warm steam and said very formally, \"According to our agreement, I'll share the reward I received this time with you. The Whites gave a total of fifty pounds, and you obviously did more than I did. Only fifty pounds? A vampire is only worth fifty pounds?\" Klein couldn't help but silently lampoon. \"Apart from Mr. Stanton, you're the best detective I've ever met,\" Stuart said with a smile. \"What great detective have I studied under? There's quite a number of Klein was stunned for a moment, but then he immediately felt a bit embarrassed. He laughed dryly and said, \"I can't tell the quality of the coffee. It's all the same to me.\" After sending Stuart off, Klein went to the butcher's to buy a few ox bones and some beef. He wanted to prepare beef bone radish soup for dinner and eat it with the leftover rice. In the evening, he smelled the tantalizing fragrance of the beef bone soup, and his Adam's apple bobbed up and down twice. He heard the doorbell again, as though it was a bugle to signal dinner time. The image of the visitor naturally appeared in his mind. It was the handsome but not masculine red-eyed vampire, Emlyn White. He was about to say something when Klein looked at his brown clerical robes and said with a knowing smile, \"You just came over from the Harvest Church?\" The vampire gritted his teeth and said \"That old man, that old man... How do I get rid of this inducing suggestion?\" He patted the clothes on his chest and said  \"Take me to the patient. There's a good dinner waiting for me.\" He sniffed indiscernibly, as if he had smelled something. \"Do you know most about Backlund?\" Klein responded without any curiosity. \"It sounds like he's rather proud of receiving a certificate for practicing medicine without practicing it\" Dr. Emlyn White visited Lawyer Jurgen's grandmother, who was suffering from lung disease. He gave her medicine that would help her breathe better, but it would only last for a few months. He also performed a divination on the Jurgens, and they decided to try it out. Mrs. Doris felt much better after taking the medicine, and said, \"I feel much better. Thank you so much, Dr. White!\" The Jurges were delighted, but they were also worried about the effects of the sun on the vampire. They decided to wait until after the winter to try out the medicine on their grandmother, and then try the sun again, if it was still working for them. The sun is a type of magic. Using Beyonder powers to create fake outcomes to make an audience happy is a form of magic that can be used to create a happy audience. It is not recommended to use this type of power on humans, however, as it can lead to the death of the person who is using it. The Beyonder can also be used for other purposes, such as to make people feel good about themselves, or to make them feel better about themselves. The Sun Brooch is a symbol of the power of the Beyonder, which can only be used on humans. It can't be used by vampires. It has been used by the Beyonders in the past, but only as a warning."}
{"num_chp":655,"summary":"Klein woke up from his dreams because he subconsciously considered the questions that he had accumulated. He retrieved the Sea God Scepter from the \"spirit world's unique zone!\" He remembered that he was in an intense battle with the Saint of Darkness just before he left the dream! The slightly dim golden light shone into Klein's eyes as everything immediately turned bright. His awakening was due to the intense struggle in the dream, not due to a natural occurrence! That also meant that he needed to sleep immediately; otherwise, he might very well disappear in the dark night, never to be found again! Klein pushed his right hand to the ground, flipping his body up as he flew towards his bed and laid himself down. Then, he imagined the stacked spherical lights and quickly entered his dream. He was facing a floor-to-ceiling window that faced the setting sun. He vaguely felt that there was a fog encompassing the surface of the sea relatively far away. Amidst the fog, he saw a cathedral composed of rather ancient architecture. It was completely black in color. There wasn't a bell tower, and at the top of it were pitch-black ravens spiraling around it as though they were consecrating or lamenting over something. The cathedral has many buildings around it. There are ordinary two-story residences and simple wooden huts. Pedestrians pass through the main streets and alleys with their figures flitting about, impossible to know of their actual situations Klein woke up in the black cloister's library. He saw the huge palaces, magnificent steeples, and the towering city walls that all appeared frozen in the sunset. But as they were blocked, it was impossible to confirm whether Cattleya remained in her original spot. Within a certain radius, it's not possible to leave this region. He took out the Book of Charms and began reading in a serious manner with the sunset's glow. While he was engrossed in this, the light suddenly bloomed as blinding whiteness blanketed his vision. He recalled the dream. The Saint of Darkness and Leomaster are in a ruin nearby. He had split his personality, separating his good and evil sides. That sealed and dark prison is the reflection of his inner dream. It's no wonder that Will Auceptin told me not to attempt exploring the dream! These places are really filled with danger! He felt like he had lost a good opportunity to study. He straightened his hair, wore his cap, and went to the deck. As he observed his surroundings, he recalled his previous dream. That dream was very magical and sinister. It actually managed to clone a Gehrman Sparrow... It's because I got rid of my sinister thoughts and mind... These waters clearly have the Beyonder remains... And this belongs to the Spectator; therefore, being able to split good from evil and causing dissociated personalities does make logical sense. Klein felt that he had roughly understood the truth to the matter and felt a little regret. He must originally be very evil, but that ruin or item stirred up his inverse side, which is the good hidden deep in his heart. It caused a split personality; hence, he is trapped somewhere nearby. Otherwise, with the Sea God Scepter and Leomaster's good side, there's a high chance of defeating his evil side, the Saint of Darkness. And the damage dealt in the dream world would continue on in the real world. It will make it easier to strike down on this cultist organization...Klein silently sighed and turned halfway around and watched Anderson Hood walk out of the cabin. \"I didn't actually find you,\" the Strongest Hunter asked as though they were best buds. \"Strange...\" Anderson frowned as though he was very puzzled. \"There's another strange incident.\" Klein asked cooperatively. \"Back when I was pretending to make a canoe in the hall last time, I heard the sounds of a door opening and of footsteps that came out from deep inside. But when I looked up, I found nothing.\" \"I originally thought that it was someone from the ship, but later it didn't seem like the case.\" Klein replied. \"Shouldn't you return to the spot where you left the dream upon returning there again?\" \"There are other elements involved in my random appearance in other spots within a particular radius?\""}

Sequence 6 and Sequence 5 will naturally pass a part of it in an uncontrollable manner. Although the quantity isn't a lot each time and wouldn't affect the Beyonder's strength, their Sequence will regress if they have enough children\" The Hanged Man pondered the facts for two seconds before asking, \"Is the Shepherd Elder still in prison?\" The Chief The Sun didn't hide the facts, saying, \"This exploration will be led by the Chief Sun. This will be the last time the danger will be much lower than last time\" He then turned his head and asked, \"Where is the half-destroyed temple?\" Derrick answered without sounding too grave. \"It sounds like there's a certain level of safety there. It's the Fallen Creator,\" Derrick said. \"I've been assigned to go there.\" The Chief Sun didn's hide the fact that he was still in the temple, and said, \"It's the Half-Destroyed Temple\" The Hanged Man told the Tarot Club members to head to the Fallen Creator's temple for exploration. The Sun and Derrick were under surveillance by Amon, who is archenemies with The Fallen Creator. The six-member council will basically determine that you're no longer under Amon's influence. Derrick asked, \"What else do I need to pay attention to?\" The Fool, who was quietly watching, opened his mouth and said, \"Flesh and blood, ravings.\" The Sun instantly relaxed and thanked The Fool for his advice. Alger then turned to the woman opposite him, \"Miss Justice, I wish to know the political changes in Backlund after Duke Negan's passing.\" Audrey recalled the information she had heard, both directly and indirectly in recent times. The House of Lords was divided over how to deal with the death of the Duke of Backlund. The Duke's eldest son is about to inherit the nobility title and become a member of the House of Lord. Ten members of the Lords have jointly proposed that the newly conferred nobility should also have a chance to obtain a fixed seat as a Member of Parliament. Without the minimum amount of land needed for a noble title, their status as nobles would be on the verge of collapse. Audrey calmly explained, \"Owing money wasn't a fatal threat to many nobles, but the debtor could apply to the court and use their lands as payment for the debts. You can give it a try.\" Klein announced the end of the Tarot Gathering after they were done. Audrey didn't rush to get up. She first quietly sorted out the things she needed to do after this. She described how she learned of someone who requested the characteristic of a Human-skinned Shadow and the Wind-blessed potion formula. After an unknown period of time, the sound of the doorbell rang, breaking the afternoon silence. Alger Wilson walked out of the hotel and headed for a secret underground market. His target was the hair of a Deep-sea Naga. The capital of the Rorsted Archipelago, the City of Generosity. He had no intention of missing a human-skin Shadow if someone had it. He still needed quite a bit of cash to ensure that he could purchase the items directly when he received clues regarding the Human- skin Shadow's characteristics. He was short on money...Klein sat in the living room and sighed again. He thought for a long time, wondering if he should find other channels to sell the Beyonder characteristic left by the Interrogator and stop waiting for Miss Xio to save up her money. After pacing back and forth in the room, Fors finally made up her mind and pulled out her chair. She grabbed a piece of paper and a pen and, after mulling over it for nearly a minute, began to write to Dorian Gray. She wrote: \"I can tell Miss Escalante that I've met"}
{"num_chp":377,"summary":"Klein's eyes rapidly turned dark, and his eyelids drooped. In a fragmented dreamscape, he saw the spacious, elegant dining room where there was gilded porcelain cutlery, caviar, roasted chicken, lamb stew, fried rib eye steak, deep-fried Dragon-Bone Fish, thick creamy soup, and so on. Among them was the slightly plump Capim; the middle-aged gentleman in a white hood, Harras; the thin-bloused Katy; and Parker, whose face was rather unintimidating due to his old age. Outside the window, the clouds were sparse, and the crimson moon was faintly discernible in the air. Klein opened his eyes and marked the location of the moon in his dream. Using his knowledge in astromancy, he quickly calculated a rough corresponding time. It looks like it's from 7:30 to 7:45 in the evening... Considering those few scenes, Capim and the others have already finished more than half their meals, so I can push the time back by another 15 minutes. That way,7:30 is the best choice...Klein muttered silently to himself as he interpreted the revelation from his dream divination. He repeated the time once more before returning to the real world. He became acutely aware of a problem: Where were Capim's wife and children? They didn't appear in the dining room... Is Capim an extreme believer in the Lord of Storms Odysseus was a human trafficker in Backlund. He had taken a fifth of the market share of the unlawful slave trade. He wanted to become a true member of the upper-class-class. He told his boss, Capim, that he wanted revenge on the Zmanger gang. Capim was about to reply when the door suddenly opened and the middle-aged gentleman with a white wig, Harras, walked in. Harras asked, \"I heard that one of your subordinates had a conflict with a gang in East Borough and ended up dying?\" Capim stood up, cigar in hand and said, \"You want revenge on them?\" Harras said in an affirmative tone, \"No, there's nothing wrong with his death. I didn't get any feedback.\" Capim acted enlightened, \"Then I'm relieved\" He then signaled him to leave and said he would send a batch of goods over to Harras. He then told Odysseu to send his wife, child, and wife to his room tonight. He said he didn't want to be involved in anything like that anymore. The two left the room together and left the highlands together. The next day, the two were in the middle of a fight. The fight was over the body of Fabian, the leader of the Z manger gang, who had been stabbed in the neck by a member of Capim's subordinates. Klein was in no hurry to be summoned. Instead, he took out the Sun Brooch and other mystical items, and he absorbed them into his Spirit Body according to his plan. When the ritual was over, Klein immediately took four steps counterclockwise and went above the gray fog, ready to respond to himself. He had a black crown on his head and a long cape of the same color on his back. At that moment, Klein was like an emperor about to embark on a journey. He immediately flew under the cover of the night towards Capim's villa on Iris Street in Cherwood Borough. Since it wasn't really late into the night yet, there were no Beyonders on guard outside. Klein wasn't afraid that the powerful Beyonders inside would notice and have a premonition. He examined the purifying bullets and revolver that he didn't bring with him before taking a step forward and entering the crack on the illusory door. It was as if he could lift a gun and move a table and chair! A dark and ethereal mist rose up around him, and as the mist clung onto the surface of his body, it formed an imposing set of armor. At this moment, the classical clock hanging in the hall read 7:23. The disguised Klein took out his golden pocket watch, looked at the exact time, then he sealed the room with a wall of spirituality. He quickly set up an altar and conducted a ritual."}

I wonder what was the real name of this pathetic fellow who was lost and trapped in the deep darkness amidst the storms is, and what his Sequence is. Or rather, just as Emperor Roselle had guessed, he's one of the evil gods or devils...Klein let out a silent chuckle which was mixed with ridicule and self-deprecating humor. He was also interested in the history of the Fourth Epoch. To his surprise, the War of the Four Emperors described by Mr. Door clearly and unambiguously revealed one thing-all three empires had existed at the time! If this were true, then it would really overturn most of the current research on the current Epoch of history. Klein suddenly thought of the original Klein, who was filled with interest towards archeology and the history regarding the FourthEpoch. I wish if Death had already become a true deity during the 'War of the four Emperors' during the Four Epoch, I would have helped him achieve his goals. It's hard to determine according to Mr. door's descriptions, but Death went mad, but he also became stronger. Therefore, Death teamed up with the Primordial Demoness and brought about a Pale Disaster for the Northern Continent. Of course, this isn't something he witnessed personally, but rather something that he hears when he comes close to the real world every month.

He believed that the Dark Emperor was the common name used by every emperor of the Solomon Empire. He flipped through the next four pages and was disappointed to realize that they were no longer related to Mr. Door. His ability as a Clown allowed him to conceal his emotions well, and coupled with the gray fog's obstruction, even Audrey, who was secretly observing him, didn't notice anything amiss. \"I've had f**king sh*t for a long time, but still can't complain a little,\" he said. \"Of course, allowing the Church to attach great importance to me is that my greatest advantage is that the first few Sequences lack any powers needed for combat. I can only make way too much on external items\" For example, Sequence 9 Savant has extraordinary abilities in memory, learning, and practical skills. For Sequence 8 Savant gains a strong physique and corresponding ancient knowledge, and they can only apply some ritualistic magic. For. Sequence 8, the Archaeologist gains a corresponding physique and ancient knowledge. for. Sequence 9, the archaeologist gains extraordinary abilities. for example, for Sequence 1 is the peak existence of a single pathway. According to this logic, for Dark Emperor to live for centuries or over a millennium wouldn't be unacceptable. That would explain the original Klein's confusion. He felt that the future he imagined Klein's diary was written by Emperor Roselle Gustav, Consul of the Church of the God of Steam and Machinery. The diary details Klein's plans to gain Beyonder powers combat powers that he can call his own. He lampooned and remembered the unique trait of the church's members, who were good at making and using items, but not very powerful Beyonder objects. After reading the diary, Klein wrote: \"Am I going to end up as an all-powerful mad scientist? Heavens have mercy on me. I was only a second-tier student at the college entrance examination! I like that name.\" He continued reading: \"The Sauron family has witnessed the history of the Fourth Epoch and is an ancient family with a high possibility of having High-Sequence Beyonders. I need to be very careful. First, I'll let the rebels destroy order before I end it all as a protector. Consul RoseLle Gustav. Ilike that name. I like it. I can't appear immediately. First,. I'll letting the rebelsdestroy order beforeI end itall as a. protector. ILike that name! ConsulRoselle. Gustav. He like thatname. It had to be said that Emperor.

He took his cane, put on his hat, and left the cathedral, taking a rental carriage back to Minsk Street in the dark. Shortly after midnight, Klein took out his key, opened the door to his house, and entered the empty guest rooms to search for the Book of Secrets. It didn't take him much effort to find the old book, bound in thick goatskin, in the wardrobe in a room on the first floor. He planned on waiting for the commotion to subside before deciding on which to take out and which to carry. After doing all this, he didn't even bother to study the Werewolf Beyonder characteristic or the bottle of biological poison. He simply washed up and laid in bed. In less than ten seconds, he entered the land of dreams as various fragmented scenes appeared alternately before him. In the clearing surrounded by the abandoned warehouses, the Machinery Hivemind came and went before coming again. The person in charge of investigating this incident went from being a team captain to an expert at the rank of deacon. He was holding a silver mirror with ancient patterns on it. On each side of the mirror was an eye-like ornament. They were built on the foundation of a black gem which looked serene and charming. The scene was played out in front of their eyes, but his head was hidden in the darkness. Ikanser was about to ask his teammates for their opinions, when a line of text in ancient Feysac appeared on the surface of the mirror. The word \"punishment\" was blood-red, as if it were dripping with liquid! The expression on Ikanser's face was twisted at first before it turned abnormally serious. The \"fireworks\" bloomed in a splendid and resplendent fashion as they lit up the entire scene. In this dreamlike scene, the man in the black double-breasted frock coat appeared once again. He faced forward, pressed his hat to his chest, and bowed slightly. He then said, \"Based on the principle of reciprocity, it's my turn to ask the question. If you answer wrong or lie, you will be punished.\" After reciting the statement, he quickly entered the dreamland and witnessed one scene after another. He saw a woman with a complicated black regal dress and messy blonde hair. However, her face was completely transparent,. as if she didn't exist. Two men with black fur all over their bodies. Only their backs could be seen as they were being pulled by strange arms. Finally, the changes came to an end as it fixed onto the blazing flames that soared into the sky. It was almost 8 o'clock. The sky was just beginning to brighten. The sleeping Klein awoke to the punctual church bells. He wanted to study his spoils from Klein performed a dream divination, but this time he didn't have the confidence to gain a detailed revelation. Therefore, he changed the divination statement to: \"Its positive and negative effects.\" In the gray gloom of the dream world, Klein once again saw tragic scenes. When the scene reached the end, the translucent brown bottle was placed into a cup with water. The transparent liquid inside gradually turned amber in color and was drunk. The person holding onto the bottle of biological poison was weakened at first before coughing. He found himself scalding as his condition turned for the worse. The dream quickly ended. Klein turned his attention to the Book of Secrets, which was bound in goatskin. He then casually flipped to the first page. It was a title page with simple patterns on it but with nothing written on it. He finally saw the opening line: \"We worship the moon, not the Evernight Goddess.\" He didn't know if the Biological Poison Bottle was effective in there. Klein rubbed his forehead, intending to do some experiments above the gray fog when he was free. He wasn't afraid of being poisoned at all in his current Spirit Body state, but he wasn't sure if the poison would work on him. He decided to leave it at this and study it in detail in the future. The effective range of the poison cannot be deciphered via a revelation. Even if the person holding the biological Poison Bottle doesn't open the lid, their bodies would get"}

Audrey held back the urge to engage in shopping, because she knew that Xio needed the item. She also sensed that something good had happened to The Hanged Man this week. He appeared more spirited than before, appearing more confident. He had also asked me where Obninsks that do not belong to the Church of Storms can be found. This is likely related to the ritual... He has already advanced?Cattleya suddenly felt a sense of danger. She suspected that The World, Mr. Fool's Blessed, had contacted an angel that was in service to Mr Fool! She was like The Magician, believing The World only knew of clues to the location of an angel or its remains. They never expected him to directly converse with an angel! The Grounded Angels were equivalent to the leaders of the seven Churches. It's not that easy to advance... I still don't see any hope despite preparing for years...

The Tarot Gathering then proceeded into a period for free communication. The conversation between The World and The Hermit ended, and the transactions came to a formal end. The next step was to find an opportunity to communicate with the unborn fetus. However, he suspected that the paper crane would tear at any moment.

The bronze door which was covered with mysterious patterns remained standing erected in its original spot. It didn't vanish because of Ludwell's retracting of his left hand and subsequent actions. This was different from the similar-looking ability that Miss Sharron had previously cast using a mystical item. Klein jumped out of the darkness as he held a huge handful of charms from the Sea God domain. While these attacks inundated Ludwell, the extraordinary effects also augmented Admiral Hell. He was given augmented effects like Underwater Breathing, underwater mobility, flight, and pressure resistance, none of which were useful at that moment. Klein had planned on using the Priest of Light by clashing head-on with the bronze door with Light of Holiness to catch a breather, but he ended up seeing a glaring white fireball about half the height of a person fly over. The fireball's speed was augmented by the ridiculous suction forces generated by the door. It smashed Klein and smashed the door at the gap of the mysterious door. The door quaked a little and a few matchsticks in his pockets immediately lit up as he melted away. He instantly noticed that Anderson Hood was floating in midair in a rather awkward manner in front of him. He quickly shouted in ancient Hermes as the tin flakes lit up The Black Tulip sailed into another world. It was surrounded by countless shadows, wraiths, and undead creatures. The sailboat sank a few meters and swallowed a few mouthfuls of bitter and astringent seawater before it ultimately recovered. The crew of the sailboat were forced to abandon the vessel. They were forced into a new world, which was completely different from the one they had come from. They had to find a way to get out of the new world and back to the old one. The journey was very difficult. It took the crew several hours to get back to their ship. The ship had to be towed back to its original location. The sailors had to fight their way out of a hole in the middle of the sea. The battle was finally won by the Black Tulips, who had been forced to retreat to their home world. The fight was over. The new world was now safe and the sailors were able to return to their homes. The end of the world was near, but they had to wait until the end to find out what had happened to the previous world. They would have to go back and find out if they could get back into the old world. But they had already lost their way to the new one, so they could not go back. They could only go back to where they came from, and that was not very far away. The future was in the future, and the present was the past. Klein splashed a few times and floated to the surface, just in time to see the gigantic sailboat's tail meld into the darkness as the bronze door slowly closed. He instinctively swam forward a few seconds before ultimately stopping. He selected one of his remaining charms and gave himself the Beyonder effect of Underwater Breathing. At this moment, the starlight above the Future fell and condensed into a long bridge that extended over. If only Admiral Hell had hesitated a little and didn't flee in such a timely fashion...Anderson Hood sighed silently and firmly landed on the star bridge. He was just about to greet and praise Gehrman Sparrow when he saw the cold and gloomy expression. He made way and chuckled dryly, allowing Gehrmen Sparrow to walk past him. After returning to the Future via the starbridge, Klein held back his effusing emotions and watched Frank Lee walk over and give him a thumbs up. He thought in response that in terms of craziness, I'm far inferior to you... I was on the Black Tulip the entire time. He closed his eyes and felt his Faceless potion completely digest. He then opened his eyes to see Frank Lee standing next to him.

He opened his eyes and confirmed that he could no longer use the blood in his hand to divine the location of Vice Admiral Ailment Tracy. This meant that a demigod powerhouse had used a mysticism technique to sever the connection between the two. Klein was instantly enlightened as he hurriedly made another divination. Finally, he confirmed that the Demoness of White really was still alive. This was because he had already obtained the information he needed from Demoness. of White Katarina. He put down the piece of paper that was stained with Vice. Admiral AILment's blood and suddenly chuckled. He had an idea.

One went from death to survival, while the other went from victory to instant despair. He would sacrifice his two marionettes and a few mystical items in order to ensure his own safety. The Tyrant had succeeded in the hunt. A terrifying creature rose up from the bottom of Calder\u00f3n City like a tidal wave, and it appears to be a more terrifying and horrible creature. The Spirit Worldplunderer attends to the end of the region, at the deep pit's core, still as silent as ever. There's no sound at all at all, making it more horrifying.... making it even more horrifying. It was as though a massive creature had awoken as a result of the Spirit world Plunder's death, or that countless dangerous creatures were surging out. It didn't seem real. Even with the Tyrant's augmentation, it didn't seems real. It's as though the Spirit Body had turned rather illusory. It doesn't seem like a real body at all. It seems like a dream.

Ouroboros's silver eyes already had the distant figure in \"His\" sights. It was a figure wearing a papal tiara and a dark blue robe, exuding extreme oppression and tyranny. There was a grayish-white fog that had been blurred by the Tyrant's aura. Klein didn't dare look at it carefully, as there was a more complicated structure in the object that was the weightless, transparent object of a palm. The corresponding figure was unable to return as the rebooted scene shattered, turning back to the desolate state after the battle. The Tyrant card had left his body and was down beside the Black Emperor card. After resting for a while, the mottled powder fell onto the table's surface. Following that was a transparent item that seemed to be the size of a human palm, formed by coiled maggots like a human, almost shaped like a hand. The item was the substance that was used to stir the powers of nature, but it was the same as a human-skinned glove, with a colorless liquid inside that was filled with a black liquid.

I have to seek out information on Bizarro Banes. I can't put all my hope on the City of Silver...Amidst his thoughts, Klein directly returned to his body, without bringing his marionettes. He ended the ritual and headed straight for bed, falling asleep the moment his head hit the pillow. They had just finished their operation and had captured a few Numinous Episcopate members. The key personnel the intel pointed at, Hand of White Palenque Taciblius, wasn't at the secret gathering point.

He entered the cathedral, passing through the murals that were illuminated by the sun from high above and arriving at a dark and deep prayer hall. Two figures stood up in the front pew and turned towards the entrance. One of them was the black-haired, green-eyed Leonard Mitchell who looked suave with his untidy hair. The other was a middle-aged man with the white sideburns and deep blue eyes. He tensed up momentarily as his body showed signs of indiscernible stiffness. It was also someone he knew-Daly who was wearing a spirit medium's black robe. She still wore blue eyeshadow and blush, presenting quite an uncanny sense of beauty. He realized that he didn't really understand Dunn Smith. He didn't understand how many things the man had hidden inwardly. And Ma'am Daly isn't much younger than him. She appears to be very open and doesn't care about marriage...Klein silently sighed and reined in his thoughts. He found a nearby pews and bowed his head, closing his eyes to pray. He conjured The World Gehrman and made his blurry figure make his way to a hotel room and reserve a room before Friday night. It's best that far from the place where Mr. Soest, who had become a Spirit Warlock, walked out from another side. With only two days left before the assassination attempt on Mr. X, Klein undoubtedly needed to prepare ahead of time. Dwayne Dant\u00e8s wasn't able to do everything, so he had to rely on Miss Magician. Klein considered for a while before deciding on a method he was very proficient in from his previous life. He had even considered directly summoning and responding to himself, using his identity as Hero Bandit Black Emperor to carry out the operation. But doing so would cause him to lose the ability to change his physical appearance. It also made it difficult for him to possess others and disguise as Fors's friend to participate in the gathering. The full-body mirror first turned deep black before silver light surfaced. Loenese text appeared one after another. \"Great Master, your loyal and humble servant, Arrodes, heard your summoning. W-was I late?\" There's something new every time...Klein shook his head in amusement. \"How tolerant you are of me, Great Master. You can ask your question.\" Words neatly appeared on the mirror for a few seconds before changing. \"I plan on eliminating the Aurora Order, Mr.X, after Thursday.\" It's in line with my divination... Ouroboros or a Saint Angel of Fate might be around Mr X tonight and on Thursday on Thursday. I need to make certain preparations. I have something that requires your help.\" Words quickly emerged, fully professing what it meant to be excited \"May I ask what the mission is?\" Klein nodded and said, \"This Friday night, I will be using a mirror as an illusion prop, changing it to look like my present identity... If any emergencies happen, you're in charge of controlling the mirror to answer without letting anyone discover any abnormalities\" The air around the full-body mirror suddenly gushed around, and a toady voice belonging to Dwayne Dant\u00e8s sounded: \"Great Master, I'll try my best to complete anything you command!\" Klein's facial muscles trembled as he said: \"When dealing with them, hide the nature of the question-and-answer game. Don't let others notice it.\" He believed that with the magic mirror's way of doing things, it might very well carry out such an act without any forewarning. \"That will be all for today.

The messenger summoned by the harmonica's historical projection was an objective existence. It didn't increase the spirituality burden of Forsythe. For some reason, Emlyn felt like he had been ostracized and didn't belong here. He looked at the Wraith in a daze, then at Gehrman Sparrow and the spirit world creature he summoned. The Wraith looked at him as though he was examining an idiot, and said, \"Alright.\" He cast his gaze on the high stool on the other side of the room. \"Miss Sharron, please come out for the discussion. I have limited time.\" As he spoke, he took out a silver adventurer's harmonica and blew into it. The door behind them seemed to have a life of its own as it slammed to a close. It opened automatically, revealing a dark environment blanketed with faint moonlight. The pair entered and saw the white-shirt and black-vested Maric sitting on the sofa. Maric immediately stood up, pressed his hand to his chest, and bowed at Sherlock Moriarty."}

He made a rather pious wish: \"I wish for my spirituality to be restored.\" With that said, he raised his right hand, snapped his fingers, and granted his own wish. This prevented the Church of the God of Combat's chief shepherd, Larrion, from escaping. There was a limit to the power of \"Wishes\" A Miracle Invoker couldn't satisfy the same wish in a short period of time, which meant that, within the next one or two hours, Klein couldn't recover his spirituality by granting his own wishes. But to a qualified Seer-pathway angel, this limitation was something that could be avoided. For example, he could get Pasha, Roy, Biles, and Arianna to take turns to wish for Klein to regain his spirituality before granting their wishes as a Miracle Invokers. But the problem was that, even if he could recover his. spirituality that many times, he wouldn't be able to maintain the \"curtain\" which was at the level of a Sequence 1 for more than an hour. Furthermore, he needed to wait an hour before 0-02 erased all the previous rules and rewrote them. \"He\" wanted to rush out of the barrier the moment the old \"Curtain\" disappeared and before the new \" Curtain\" was produced. Klein used Flaming Jump to appear outside the shrunken Belltaine City LIbrary. He used his Spirit Vision at the level of an angel and saw the collapsed, dilapidated, and fogged palace. He then used his historical projection to take the Trunsoest Brass Book and \"Blink\" to the main door of the palace before pushing the door open. There appeared before him a hall with many corpses hanging from above. There were men and women, either dressed beautifully, simply, exquisitely, or casually. They came from the depths of the hall-from that ancient stone chair. On the huge stone chair, transparent and distorted maggots were formed into a ball. They grew wantonly and extended out strange tentacles. At the bottom of the chair, the card with Roselle's image, which was written with a stellar radiance, flew towards the door. Thankfully, Klein's historical projection didn't experience a breakdown and was remotely controlled by Klein. He wouldn't even be surprised if Amon was among the group! The smile on Larrion's face froze again. He muttered softly, \"Impressive...\" following that, he became silent again until the magic mirror emitted an aqueous light that reflected the noticeboard's current state. The rules on the paper disappeared in reverse order of their appearance. This meant that 0-02 was beginning to erase the rules that it had set up, and was preparing to redo everything Klein's historical projection had mostly collapsed. He felt a sense of joy and relief, as well as a strong sense of doubt. He walked out of the hidden area and arrived not far from the ancient palace. He bent down and picked up the Card of Blasphemy. On the surface of the card was Roselle Gustav, who was wearing colorful clothes and holding a stick and luggage. His eyes were filled with a longing for the future, and behind him was a puppy. The resplendent stellar radiance outlined a few words: \"Sequence 0: The Fool!\"Inside the ancient Palace, the Trunsoest Brass Book fell to the ground and opened up to the first page of the second half of the book. New rules began to form: \"No living being is permitted to touch it\" and \"Those in violation are to be sentenced to death!\" After just two lines, there was an additional clause in front of them-0-02 seemed to have reached a blank slate that happened when the entire book was filled up with maggots. The Fool card had reached the door one step ahead of the strange tentacles. The transparent and slippery tentacles sensed danger and instinctively reacted by wrapping around Sealed Artifact 0-02. They were blocked by the fog, unable to exit. All it could do was wildly pound at the barrier. The open door slowly closed, blocking out this scene.

Deities directly walked the land without the need for a descent. The Chasm of Storm on Pasu Island and the Tenebrous Heaven in the Amantha mountain range were the divine kingdoms of the Lord of Storms and Evernight. They were divine kingdoms separated from the real world by a mere illusory door. The Elvish Songster Siatas, who was in charge of the perimeter, walked in and said with contempt, \"Do not mention that fake god. The authority of the storm only belongs to the king of us elves!\" Her voice was clear and beautiful, but her tone was filled with anger and irascibility. It felt as though she would raise her hands at any moment to shoot an arrow at Mobet. \"Alright, I will use the words \u2018fake god,'\" Mobet raised his hand to adjust his sharp and hard black hat. \"I know that you aren't very convinced and find it unbelievable that deities walked the lands, just like Edwina's previous reactions.

Klein shot a glance at the ascetic, Snowman, who believed in the Lord that created everything, the omnipotent and omniscient God. Siatas stood up and aimed her arrow at him. A huge grayish-blue palm appeared before her, blocking the arrow tip, without any fear of being struck. It was the palm of the giant, Groselle. One of the traits of this race was its exaggerated limbs. They were so long that they appeared a little distorted. Therefore, simply by sitting there, he could stop SiatAs by extending his arm. He's filled with positivity and positivity. He can even beat him up, but do not attempt to harm him. The Storm will definitely belong to the elves!\" He said, before turning his head to the Elvish Songster and saying, \"We have experienced plenty of dangers together. You can retort to him and we can leave our backs to each other.\" He's expected to lead the lead of the book, but he's not sure if he can do it yet. Klein listened attentively, only wishing to ask more. The contents of the conversation between Gehrman Sparrow and the few ancient figures were things that they had never heard of. He asked, \"Apart from \u2018Him,' Ouroboros, Medici, and Amon, what other Kings of Angels are there? You don't have to say out all \u2018Their' names.\" Edwina spoke before him, \"Groselle, what did the book look like when you received it?\" Groselle raised his hand to rub his cheeks. \"It had nothing, like an empty book waiting to be written.\" The entire cave shook. The familiar and crazy tyrannical aura rapidly descended! The King of the North Ulyssan had arrived! He was the only one in the cave at the time. He was also the only person who knew the name of the Dark Angel Sasrir, the leader of the Kings of. Angels, the one closest to the Lord. He also knew the names of the Angel of Imagination, Adam, and Blasphemer Amon, the archenemies of us Zoroasts. He had also known about the Waning Forest, where only the Giant King's Court can enter.

He followed his plans and reenacted the trial runs that he had practiced numerous times by grabbing Tinder with his left hand, pulled it off, and threw it onto the stone ground of the magnificent palace. He responded to the summoning ritual and used his Spirit Body state to come to the real world. He then brought Tinder back to the mysterious space. He could sense the extreme madness and danger from it, but it appeared to be in deep slumber. He didn't dare delay any further and did the evil-exuding Tinder was tainted with an iron-black color as its palm opened and its palm cracked. He opened his eyes, grabbed the All-Black Eye, and saw the illusory, evil, terrifying, and indescribable ravings boomed in his ear like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.

The potion turned into a pale gold color, but it looked ethereal as though it was weightless. He steadily picked up the pupil-less black eye and dropped it into the potion. He had already confirmed that the True Creator's mental corruption hadn't penetrated the gray fog or returned inside the All-Black Eye. He didn't act in a fluster or rush. He followed the process he had planned by quickly clearing up the altar in the bathroom, and he retrieved Azik's copper whistle and Will Auceptin's paper crane. The symbols and magical labels on the Future had once again lit up, forming a resplendent sea of stars. It significantly reduced the mermaids' singing. They were so clear, it was as though they were singing softly by Klein's ears. Each tone stirred his Spirit Body, and the melody was intoxicating. He felt his mind adrift as he nearly jumped into the sea and swam towards the source of melodic singing. He tried his best to control himself and discovered many reefs ahead. Figures were seated at its edge as they sang. Their eyes were lifted up high, but they were also covered by dark breasts. The lower halves of their bodies were comprised of massive fish that struck as they struck the reef. They had different colored scales and different colored colored scales. From a human's standpoint, they were all a different kind of beauty. Klein relinquished his control of the dinghy, raised his right hand, and reached into his pocket for the potion. At that moment, the mermaids sensed his approach and looked over. Then, these creatures, who were also known as sirens, stopped singing out of shock. All of them leaped into the water with a splash. Klein felt as though he had returned to Tingen, back when he was being controlled by the strange puppet known as Sealed Artifact 2-049. His skin was yellowish-brown, like a puppet that had been buried alive for years with old bandages. He felt that tiny worms were boring into every one of his cells and into his Spirit Body. His thoughts slowed down as his brain reflected the gradual loss of control over his body. After an unknown period of time, Klein opened his eyes, his body having completely restored to normal. He took a deep breath and silently sighed. \"I'm finally a Nimblewright Master! I'm finally finally a Sequence 5! I've been waiting for this for a long, long time! I can think again!

However, the second level of the Box of the Great Old Ones had an element of randomness to it. The act of sending things to the designated scene succeeded a handful of times. Most of the time, the selected destination would suffer an unavoidable change. This was something that couldn't be influenced with luck, and at the very least, no one below Sequence 0 could do so. Since it wasn't directly experienced, Klein could instantly dispel the Historical Void projection, enter Sefirah Castle to do a complete \"disinfection\" and sever all connections. This meant that they could only consider giving up on the operation, and he would undertake the responsibility of helping all participants escape from the battlefield and escape the Southern Continent. This way, they wouldn't be able to immediately sense that Klarman had been attacked. It was the same as not using any Beyonder powers to cheat at gambling. This left his heart filled with anxiety. Of course, he wasn't too worried. No matter where the box brought him and Miss Messenger, it was impossible to harm him in any way. He dispelled the Box and snapped his fingers, summoning a scarlet flame as he constantly jumped within them. At that moment, he heard an extremely evil roar. His mind went blank, and Klein used Creeping Hunger to flash to another side, avoiding the Blood Moon Arrow created by the Rose School of Thought's Shaman King. He grabbed at the void a few more times until he dragged out a figure. It was none other than the leader of the Church of Evernight's ascetics, the angel of the Concealment domain, Arianna. The eyes of Arianna's projection darted slightly as her eyes instantly turned dark and deep. Reinette Tinekerr, who was in a rather difficult situation and trying hard to create opportunities for him, finally managed to catch \"Her\" breath. \"She\" didn't get possessed by Abomination Suah, nor did \"She's\" become a real doll. The Shaman King could hardly stop him in an effective manner due to the unpredictability of where he would appear next. He attempted to use spells like \"Abyss Shackles\" to restrict Klein's movement, but the short-distance \"Blinking\" was simply too effective. Without the projection of the Chained God and \"His\" influence of the surrounding area, and the interference of Abomination, Klein was like a fish in water. He was free and relaxed. He only needed to consider how to deal with his enemy's spells every two \"Teleports.\" He was like an animal in water, he thought as he teleported elsewhere. He didn't dare to look directly at Abomination. He seized the opportunity and reached out with his right Abomination Suah had focused his attention on Reinette Tinekerr and subconsciously belittled Klein, leading \"Him\" to not only lose the help of the Chained God's projection, but also being thrown from the state of being the one who had laid in ambush to the one being besieged by four powerful angels. Without any hesitation, Emlyn waved his arm and threw the Vision of White at the Door of Summoning. Sharron's figure that appeared in midair distorted, turning into a human-sized puppet. It had messy, black-and-white hair and a pair of bright red eyes. As for Emlyn, he raised his left arm and revealed a translucent ring that was worn outside his gloved index finger. The ring seemed to be made of light-red amber, and there was a blood-colored gem embedded on it. It could project a door that led deep into the spirit world for a certain amount of time, summoning an unknown creature. Emlyn wasn't sure what he would obtain. He only knew that, under normal circumstances, the summoned object was usually slightly stronger than him, but the possibility of directly pulling out a demigod wasn't impossible. At the same time, even without the Sealed Artifact, he still had other mystical items to use, such as Leymano's Travels. With the notebook, he could summon the Unshadowed Crucifix to replace the vision of White."}

And if no one gives up and persists until the end, there won't be a winner. \u2018He' will be the winner.\" Amon's brows pricked up as \"He\" smiled without saying a word. They take turns pulling the trigger at their temples. It's like a game of \"Fooling\" or \"The God of Deceit\" with a twist. The rules are similar to the invasion of a virus of a first category. If the authority of the Error were to take effect at the second level, it would have different preconditions: first, the medium and second target had to be similar; third, there was a certain connection between the two; fourth, some of the rules were logical contradictions between certain matters or objects; fifth, while an \"Erroneous\" construct, affecting the target, was not directly related to the \"Error\" The rules were indeed incomplete, but it would be difficult to defend against or terminate. A conceptualized Amon rapidly gained a physical form. \"He\" relied on the \"Door\" authority to escape from \"His\" current state. The power of Sefirah Castle was at odds with itself in this second. It was as though it didn't know which Lord of the Mysteries to obey. The Amons couldn't help but gather together, turning into a conceptual cluster. Amon's eyes glazed over and the smile on his face froze as the crystal monocle lost its luster. In the next second, he \"Grafted\" himself to a certain concept in the cosmos. He used his authority to influence the corresponding environment. An unimaginable sea of scorching light surged out, shattering \"His's\" body and drowning him in the sea of light. He was still glazed, and his eyes were still revolting. The \"Blind Stupidity\" effect! It was like an unimaginable convergence force that reached an unimaginable level. It's like an invisible hand that pulled Amon back! He was now in a passive state. His body suddenly split apart, transforming into countless \"selves\" In front of every Amon, an illusory astral door appeared.

The Mandated Punishers would have the time to deal with the items when the anomaly of the seals losing their effects passed. But the premise was that they hadn't lost control of the three Grade 1 Sealed Artifacts. The biggest problem was that the remaining two Grade 1 Artifacts would undoubtedly cause serious damage to Bayam, and would soon affect the entirety of the city. It was pretty good.

We can't make any mistakes.\" Klein nodded faintly and asked about the details of the scene. \"I feel like we could even make an audience at the circus laugh,\" Klein suddenly jested. \"It's a pity that there are no fixed circuses in Tingen,\" Tolle replied wistfully. \"Do you know that some circuses are trying to use fat and skinny, tall and short clown combinations in their performances?\" \"No, actually I meant a beast tamer and a brown bear...Klein, of course, wouldn't make such a rude remark,\" he replied. \"We can't be certain, but his wife and two sons aren't willing to believe the possibility that he died due to a sudden illness. And there was really something wrong at the scene,\" said Tolle. \"There are too many guest rooms in this guest house, so it wasn't used.\" Klein recited the divination statement that he thought of long ago, \"The cause of Maynard's death.\" He then fell into a deep sleep. The Member of Parliament who died between nine and eleven the previous night suddenly sat up. He was thrusting hard against a woman with an outstanding body and fair skin. He first displayed an expression of extreme satisfaction and happiness. Then, he suddenly clutched his chest with his right hand. His expression then grew contorted. As Maynard fell, the image quickly shattered. Klein opened his eyes and woke up from his dream. So, Maynard had an affair and died of exhaustion?Klein chuckled and massaged his temples. He drew a portrait of the lady he had seen in his dream with the aid of the ritual. Of course, everything below her neck was omitted. It was a woman whose age was hard to tell. She had the mature vibe of a woman in her thirties, but there was a remnant of innocence to her. Her eyes were crystal clear, and she had a delicate look. He quickly finished the setup for the mediumship ritual. He then put away his ritual ingredients, and dispelled the spirituality wall. He immediately got goosebumps! He immediately heard the reverberating sound of someone clearing their throat. He looked towards the bed and saw Maynard gripping the crimson bedsheets so tightly that the tendons on the backs of his hands were protruding out. With a swo"}

The illusory ravings I hear are actually \"Hornacis... Flegrea?\" The World asked. \"Yes, there's a circumstantial clue that doesn't count as proof. The Life School of Thought worships the moon, the crimson moon that evolved from the Creator's eye, but they don't believe in the E overnight Goddess,\" Klein said. \"If he's not a High-Sequence Beyonder, then the Phoenix pathway can be eliminated,\" The World added. \"From the looks of it, Phoenix ancestor, Gregrace, was Death during the ancient times,\" said Klein. \"That's right,\" said Roselle. \"Mutants are the various kinds of monsters that evolve from humans due to the negative effects of certain curses, but their hearts were always filled with a suppressed, twisted desire in their hearts,\" said Derrick. \"Every time they came into contact with a certain scene or object, they would become turning into monsters,\" said The World. \"They would then succumb to their desires and lose all their positive feelings that are expected of them,\" said Mr. Azik. \"I can only think of two possibilities. One is a type that can freely switch between body and spirit, and they might not be able to direct zombies,\" Derrick said. Klein became increasingly aware of the special nature of the Forsaken Land of the Gods. The characteristics which Mutants possess happen to form a Beyonder pathway. Therefore, ordinary people can turn into Mutants by consuming potions as well. He then started to travel back and forth between the real world and the mysterious space, bringing the Master Key to the ancient palace. When the area above the gray fog returned to its peaceful state, even the fake World was gone. After Klein recovered, he wrote a divination statement: \"Its origin\" He then drank the potion to reproduce the illustrious glory of the Abraham family and turned into a monster covered in blood. After the dream ended, he opened his eyes and looked forward. He said with a sigh, \"Seriously, he said he wanted to restore the glory ofThe Abraham family, but he failed at the first step... It's risky even at Sequence 9...\" He then recalled the scene of the scene he had just seen. \"He spoke in the Loen language, \" he muttered to himself. \"I'm very satisfied with your answer. Transaction complete.\"Following that, a few members shared their experiences and news with Klein, who ended the Tarot Gathering just before his spirituality was exhausted. He was then taken to a secret room, devoid of any external light. There were long tables, black iron pots, glass jars, brown colored notebooks, and other items. A young man wearing a classic black robe stood in front of the long \"Perhaps I should visit the Harvest Church when I have the time and ask Father Utravsky where he got his Master Key from...

{"num_chp":559,"summary":"Klein's plan was to explore the spirit world and select a suitable target to become a messenger. After he left the Rorsted Archipelago and its surrounding sea, he could bring the Sea God Scepter along with him to reason with the target and convince them to become his messenger. He intended to scan the prayers of the believers as per routine for anything to respond to. Some of the prayers were actually quite interesting, because humans could deceive friends and relatives, but it was difficult to keep their truest thoughts when confessing or praying to the gods. The human heart sure is hard to fathom...Klein frowned and mumbled to himself, then he had a vague idea. He raised his Sea God Staff, making one of the blue gems glow. The light poured into the scene and imperceptibly seeped into the senior inspector named Boulaya. It was a mark of divinity that almost no one could discover. This is a unilateral way for me to \"keep tabs\" on you. It can save me time from figuring things out through accumulated experiences. It's a way of gaining experience of being someone of a higher level of being perfunctory about skimming some up, no longer about skimmer some up. After another miracle, the businessman praised the reappearance of the sea god, and he indicated that he planned to offer a third of his fortune-worth 20,000 pounds-to the Resistance for reconstruction of God's statue. Klein intended to get Ralph to set up a charity fund with the 20,000 pounds, and to seek donations widely from the community to make up for the damage, create a consensus; and help to provide local children with food, clothing, and education under the pretext of governance. The concept of direction that humans were used to could no longer be used here. This was the spirit world that couldn't be understood and viewed with common human knowledge. The Resistance shouldn't be thinking about annihilating the garrison troops. They should just focus on destroying the transportation infrastructure and make it more difficult for the governor-general's office to rule, so as to initiate talks... As a keyboard warrior, Klein wasn't lacking in ideas in such areas. He quickly restrained his wandering thoughts and made a divination to see if it was dangerous exploring thespirit world today. After obtaining the revelation that it wasn't considered dangerous, Klein took the Dark Emperor card, naturally changed his image, and stepped into the Door of Summoning. After entering the real world, he stuffed the mystical items he needed into his body as a precaution. Then, like last time, he used Cogitation to sense the spiritworld. He passed through an invisible curtain as Klein's illusory figure floated up. He could only see the vivid super-position of various symbols that he took physical form on and he began to consider whether he should write a letter to Mr Mr Feysac. Klein was floating in the spirit world when he saw a giant foot that was large enough to squash his entire body. The leg was over three meters long, and above it was a huge body that was wrapped in corpse oil bandages. The giant on the mottled stone chair didn't withdraw his gaze as he continued staring over in a long silence. Klein had no idea where he had wandered to, so he tried to contact the magic mirror, Arrodes.Azik and ask him about it, or to throw the radio transceiver above the gray fog and get it tainted with the aura, so that he could contact him. He was surprised to find that his body continued to move forward uncontrollably at an accelerating speed. He thought,The spirit world is really scary. You can accidentally encounter a powerhouse just passing by... A powerhouse among the spiritworld creatures? He shook his head and continued his search. He found some traces of spirit world creatures. The ship was nearly a hundred meters long and had three pitch-black sails hanging high up like flags. On its deck stood a colossal figure that was comparable to an ancient giant sat there. He wore a gorgeous black robe with silver fringes. The wrinkles on his face looked hardened and filled with magnificence. It made one subconsciously wish to bow their heads. It was so real, so substantial, and so out of place when it came to thespirit world as a whole."}

Klein was unable to distinguish between her and the other people in the carriage. He turned around, hoping to observe the refined and sweet lady, but all his eyes reflected were brown figures moving past him. He shook his head quietly and raised his finger to tap his glabella to deactivate his Spirit Vision. He returned to his bedroom to get a change of clothes, when he heard Melissa's voice from the balcony. \"Did you compliment Melissa's new dress?\" he asked with a smile. \"I guess I did,\" she replied, \"I forgot to ask where it was...\" Klein thought for a moment as he thought about what to say. \"It's quite, well-nice for a girl to occasionally shop at a department store.\" Klein laughed as he comforted his sister. \"What a frugal girl... Sis, I know that at least half the reason is due to your pity of Mrs. Rochelle... She leads a pretty tough life. I knew that she had pretty good skill and the price she quoted is cheaper than at a women's clothing store. Furthermore, it's very well-tailored to my figure, so I ordered a new skirt from her. It only cost nine soli and five pence and took only a few days.\" A dress of a similar style would cost three halves of a pound at After rushing to cook and wash the dishes, she immediately wore the dress and has refused to take it off ever since. Klein had a general idea what was happening. Instigator Tris had successfully escaped the Evil Dragon Bar at the harbor. He had escaped somewhere close to Iron Cross Street and Daffodil Street; therefore, the police were making visits from door to door. The operation of nabbing the Instigator had completely failed! Klein did not bother himself with the situation. He only had basic mastery of shooting, so to consider dealing with a natural \u2018Assassin' was simply using his life as a joke. He did not sleep well that night. He kept worrying that the Instigators would infiltrate their house to hide, causing another massacre. He changed into formal attire, wore his top hat, held his cane, and went all the way to Zouteland Street. He greeted Rozanne at the reception hall. She suppressed her voice and said, \"I heard the huge operation last night failed?\" Klein asked in curiosity. Rozanne nodded heavily. She shot a glance at the partition and said,. \"Apparently an informant of the Mandated Punishers discovered the Instator at the Harbor... They were planning on waiting for additional Beyonders and another Special Operations squad from the police to arrive before beginning the operation to do the deed instantly without alarming the commoners. Unfortunately, that Instigator was extremely sharp. He charged out of the encirclement when he noticed something It was as though he evaporated into thin air, disappearing completely.\" Captain Dunn Smith. Sealed Artifact 2-049 has arrived. The subsequent operation might require your sensing of that notebook. Klein's thoughts became scrambled. He imagined how the sealed item would look or if the operation would be dangerous. He followed Dunn down the stairs and into the tunnel. Dunn suddenly stopped and turned his head, saying sternly, \"Do this action together with me. Keep doing it and absolutely do not stop. This is for your own safety!\" He repeated this action without stopping. Klein did not hesitate further as he began the repeated action of bending and extending his arm. The Theosophy Order's heritage to this day must have something special about it,\" consoled Klein. \"With my security clearance, I'll probably not learn of the details. I can only do as I'm ordered...Klein exhaled as he followed Captain Dunn to the Keeper room outside Chanis Gate. He had too many questions on his mind, but since Chanis gate was in sight, he had no choice but to bear with it. \"Sealed Artifact \"2-0 49\" sure is odd... What meaning does this action have? It seems very dangerous...These thoughts flashed past Klein's mind as he looked solemnly at the captain. \"Alright\" he replied. \"I'll do what I'm told. It's what I've been told.\""}

Her smooth blonde hair was also coiled up and stuffed under a cool-colored surgical cap. She darted her eyes to the side and looked at Fors Wall who was dressed in the same way. She always felt that Fors had a special temperament that seemed to make her more suited to such attires than herself. She followed half a step behind Fors as they entered the classroom in front of them. There were four skeletal specimens and four coffins made of glass. The coffins were filled with pale naked corpses that were soaked in preserving agents. At the very top of the classroom, there was a transparent glass pillar that was also filled with a liquid. Floating inside was a male corpse that wore a black scholarly robe. The corpse's clothes stuck tightly to its body, giving off an extremely heavy feeling. He didn't relax and simply floated upright in the middle. Audrey made a preliminary judgment based on her attitude as a Spectator. She felt excited and agitated. This is what the life of a Beyonder should be...Audrey silently muttered to herself as she followed Fors to a corner before sitting down. After waiting for a while, the floating black-clothed male corpse opened his eyes. His voice transmitted through the layers of obstructions. \"Let's begin.\" Klein entered the building across the street from the crime scene. He no longer had a revolver, so all he could do was stick one hand into his pocket and hold a few tarot cards in between his fingers. The corresponding figures were reflected in Klein's soon-to-be-cooked brain. There were men, women, and children sleeping in the bunk beds, and several tenants lying in bed on the floor. Klein cowered in a corner of a balcony, his hands were on his knees as he panted heavily. He endured the pain as he continued to move forward. Once he felt some relief, he would immediately observe the other room.Unfortunately, his efforts of \"searching\" the entire apartment to see if there were any places that allowed the observation of the crime site was in vain. He finally calmed down and switched to a different apartment that didn't have the same view as this one, but it was still for naught. It was the result of his repeated contact with the All-Black Eye within a short period of time. Even with Klein's resistance in this area, he wasn't completely immune to it. He couldn't see the source of the black lines, nor could he trace them back to the source. The only thing that satisfied him was that it only agitated him and didn't corrupt him. Otherwise he would've given up long ago and wouldn't have dared to try again. That would've led directly to devolving into madness. Klein noticed a black line floating out from the crime scene on the third floor which merged into the air. He could only barely distinguish where the black lines had gathered, and this indicated that there was someone present. The man was extremely tall, almost two meters in height. The corners of his mouth drooped slightly, making him appear rather eccentric. His cold eyes were like those of a wild beast's, possessing a ferocity that couldn't be hidden. It's not Lanevus...Klein withdrew his fingers, relaxed his body, and avoided the likelihood of staring. He entered the public bathroom at the end of the corridor without stopping. He knew that in a few minutes the man would be alerted to the absence of someone who had gone to the bathroom, so he had to get as far away from the street as possible. He wiped off his cold sweat, and after quelling the negative effects, he directly jumped out the window, climbing down skillfully before leaving with brisk steps. He didn't stay a moment longer. The Clown quickly ran and circled around a huge area before entering that one-bedroom apartment he had rented in East Borough. He then went above the gray fog to confirm there was no danger of him being caught. The clown then said solemnly in a tone of authority, \"This is a clue.\" He then said, \"I've got a clue for you, Miss Justice\" The Clown then left the apartment."}

His greatest support is the mysterious space above the gray fog which happens to eliminate all interference and provide Seers the most coveted environment. He wondered what he would discover in the hidden area after he completed the staircase of light. He became increasingly wary of the leader of the Secret Order, Zaratul. He was a powerful existence that had long since become a Miracle Invoker from the Seer pathway many years ago! There might be times and matters that have his fingerprints hidden all over them! Although all of these thoughts were churning in his mind, Klein acted as though nothing had happened as he calmly said, \"You can begin your transactions.\" He suppressed his excitement and allowed Roselle's diary pages to disappear from his hands. The price of Dorian Gray Abraham's reserve price was 800 pounds, which was already at a premium above the usual 500\u2013600 pounds. Fors felt a little uneasy, as the price of 1,000 pounds was really expensive. The meaning before Mr. Fool's secret hint is that I should be able to be freed from the curse of the full moon once I become a High-Sequence Beyonder. Just like money isn't omnipotent, but nothing can be done without money... Although I've already received the fixed payment for my new book and have savings reaching 350 pounds, there's still the Spirit Eater Audrey had originally asked Mr. Fool to extend the payment period of the 2,000 pounds to February or March in order, on the one hand, to pay off her debt to Viscount Glaint. On the other hand, she had to set aside an additional budget for the ingredients of the Psychiatrist potion. After calming down, she discovered that with her experience in the acting method, she could digest the excess Beyonder characteristic much faster than she had expected. In about ten days, she would be able to completely digest and resolve the problem. When she gathers the ingredients and advances to Trickmaster, she felt that she would perfectly pass the first test given by her teacher, Dorian. She would gain more attention and would no longer be a mere student who was taken in out of gratitude. She agreed to make the payment first before she delivered the Beyonder ingredient on Wednesday. The Sun, The Hanged Man, and The World were delighted to receive the formula for the Solar High Priest potion. They were also surprised to learn that Audrey had given the formula to The Sun. She was also delighted to have found the ingredients for the Spirit Eater stomach pouch, which is higher in value than a Spirit Eater's potion. She had also given the ingredients to her father, Earl Hall, who had promised to give his daughter a further 50,000 British pounds in Backlund Bank shares and more than 2,00 pounds in cash. I don't have the gold pounds all of you were talking about.\" The Hanged Man gave a terse response. \"But I don't know what I can get from you... First, you should make a list of the common monsters found around the City of Silver and their corresponding ingredients. I'll then choose from that list.\" After the transactions came to an end, they began to freely exchange information about their areas. The World inquired for clues about mermaids and obtained an answer similar to the one he had received from Sharron. A terrifying object that is suspected to be a Grade 0 Sealed Artifact has appeared around Prince Edessak. It might even involve 0-08, which would definitely not be a simple matter. The last time a similar situation occurred, Tingen City had faced the threat of an evil god's spawn, and it had almost disappeared from the map! Hence, now there's also a hidden danger in Backlund! Klein thought for a few seconds, making The World say in a hoarse voice, \"Ladies and gentlemen, I have recently received some information that a major event is brewing in backlund. This will bring about a great deal of unrest and may lead to a tragedy.\" The World shook his head calmly and said, \"There's contradictory information, making it impossible for me to give a definite answer.\" He looked up and earnestly cast his gaze towards the figure within the gray fog at the end of the mottled"}

She had a nagging feeling that her mind had gone adrift, but she couldn't remember what she was thinking about. She continued maintaining her vigilance as she followed her originally set route in East Borough. On the way, she met an East Borough resident who was either-three or twenty-four years old. He had thinned his brows and his facial features were rather soft and he gave off an odd vibe. According to what she knew, this young man named Sherman had always thought of himself as a woman. However, a woman had played a terrible joke on him, making him believe that he was a man. Xio was taken aback as she found herself saying something very familiar. \"Sherman, did anything happen in the past few days?\" she asked. \"Yes,\" he replied. \"I'm going to East Borough to find a deceased person that had just died or one that hadn't been discovered after a period of time since their death.\" Xio sighed and agreed to accompany her friend to East borough to find the deceased person. The mission's deadline was looming, and she had delayed it by too much. Xio was about to make a request for an emergency meeting with the Aurora Order when she was tailed by a man in a black suit. The man wore a golden mask that revealed his eyes, nostrils, mouth, and cheeks. He was none other than the MI9 member who was in contact with Xio. Xio told the man that she was going to a secluded place to interrogate and channel her spirit. He said, \"To be frank, I'm very surprised that they didn't surround you and bring you directly to me\" Xio then went to the bar and ordered a drink for herself and Sherman. After drinking, Sherman asked, \"Have you made your decision?\" Xio replied, \"I-I'm willing to give it a try. Although I know that you might be bluffing me, I still wish to giveIt a try.\" The man then left and Xio went back to her room to think about what she had just said. She then wrote the opening to her new book and threw it into the trash can. She was dazed for a long time when she suddenly recalled the tail that had been following her for the past few days. She spent most of her time reading novels, newspapers, and magazines. She also drew the curtains in her room for nearly an hour, as though she was familiarizing herself with her Beyonder powers. When she had nothing to do, she got a piece of paper and spent fifteen minutes Xio was in a daze and couldn't remember what she had encountered. The golden-masked man asked, \"Are there any clues about the person I got you to search for?\" Xio shook her head after seeing him nod and said, \"Not yet. She's likely experienced.\" The man then gave her a new commission to complete. He told her to take note of the people Viscount Stratford interacts with, and list them down in a report before submitting it to him. Xio knew why: He was the captain of the royal guards; he was once her father's deputy. The mission is a rather complicated one, but if she can complete it, she'll have enough points to buy the Interrogator potion formula at other Beyonder gatherings. The man laughed and said with a laughing sigh, \"I wish you luck. I already have the Beyonder characteristic! I might be able to purchase the ingredients at other gatherings.\" Xio nodded and said she would try to get the potion as soon as possible, but it would still take a very long time. \"I will report this matter to the Aurora Order,\" the man said. \"It's not an exception for Mr. X's gathering either,\" Xio replied. \"The participants of each gathering doesn't exceed a third of the number of people invited,\" he added. \"This is mostly normal for a gathering.

He saw that this city, which hadn't suffered any serious damage in the war, had once again lit up. Alger sighed inwardly as he fervently wished to do something for Mr. fool so that he could quickly accumulate the contributions needed to transform into Sea God. The more Alger thought about it, the more alarmed he became. He had always been amazed by such matters, but he finally came to a clear realization today. He realized that the two factions were a little terrifying. All of them combined was equivalent to a quarter of the Church of Storms! According to what Alger knew, the number of Grade 0 Sealed Artifacts each Church had numbered between five to eight. There were fewer than four Ground Alger was on a mission to monitor a man named Verdu Garcia. He was a member of the Abraham family that had concealed his identity. He had recently left Desi County and had come to the Rorsted Archipelago. Verdu yearned to save Mr. Door so that the King of Angels could return to the real world. The ritual that was extremely difficult to complete could be used to effectively gain the trust of theAbrahams. It would allow them to deepen their faith in Mr. Fool and become more devout. Then, he could monitor the extreme ones among the devout and grasp their trajectories, and interfere with them in time. It was possible that as the apocalypse approached, the infiltration of the Outer Deities would only increase. This was the reason why Klein had gotten Miss Magician to inform the Abrahams of one of the rituals. If he were to hide it or lie by saying that an angel needed to be hunted for the ritual, the Abraham's would definitely suspect Fors and try to confirm it through other means. If it had been a few years ago, Klein wouldn't have been too worried about such problems, but as the Apocalypse approached, he was worried about the possibility of them coming into contact with a corresponding item or believer and obtaining the correct ritual.

He was inwardly calculating how much longer before the two ships met.Suddenly, his vision blurred and he could no longer see the liner. He searched with his telescope, but regardless of the direction he aimed it at, there was nothing but stormy waves and red-headed sea eagles. Such a huge ship had vanished! The light in Bird Mustang's eyes flickered as he failed to make an accurate judgment. The ship's captain noticed something also noticed as they also noticed something on the deck of the liner, but he couldn't make out what it was. The passengers knew very well that the owner was the King of Pirates, and was a powerful figure who could remain alive despite the campaigns of the various fleets from different nations. This meant that they were about to fall into the hands of pirates! Many women couldn't help but imagine being raped by the pirates and being sold to unfamiliar lands. The men didn't react any better.

He reverently bowed and said, \"Earl Nast, something abnormal has happened with the hunt\" Bird Mustang didn't ask why as he directly accepted the order. Bird Mustang immediately followed the order as the sea eagle swooped down in the storm. Its body gradually changed and turned into a humanoid form. It was no longer a red-headed sea eagle, but a man with a tall top hat and tuxedo. His face wore a feathered mask. He had only exhibited his existence for shock and awe purposes. He didn't want to clash with the Black Emperor and the King of the Five Seas. He wouldn't do such rash acts unless there was something worth fighting for. He was also partially due to having no choice but to make himself appear partially deliberate. The reason he had made himself appear so deliberate was because he wasn't big enough, so creating a normal human body wasn't enough. The deliberate choice was because there was no way to create a normal body without the innards even without the normal body, even without normal human's body. He wasn't keyed in to the idea that he was acting as a Bizarro Biz What was key was to use the methods of a sorcerer to appear bizarre!

At the end of it, a black platform rose up, surrounding an iron-black chair. Nast's figure was relatively normal. He was slightly taller than 1.9 meters, unlike the nonhuman form which resembled a giant that Klein had previously encountered. He had a short black mustache underneath his chin, and his black eyes swirled with a red glow.

{"num_chp":748,"summary":"Alger Wilson often made contact with a secret existence, and he often gathered in the palace of a deity's residence. He wasn't as respectful as before, but he still had to put on an act. He heard sobbing, low shouts, and whispering. This was completely different from the solemnity he previously felt in the Lightning Cathedral. He took out a small iron box from his priest robe's inner robe and placed it close to his ear. In it was the Ocean Songster Beyonder characteristic he had purchased from The World. He suspected that the residual mental imprint on it was temporarily enhanced by the Blood Moon. The Church of Storms had always been in search of elvish relics. They were used to concoct potions, made into Sealed Artifacts, or isolated underground. Those with relatively fewer negative effects were rewarded to clergymen; therefore, it wasn't odd that something similar would be stimulated on the night of the Blood moon. He soon fell asleep and had a dream. He discovered that above him was rippling dark blue seawater, stacked up layer after layer and blocked the view of the sky. Ahead was a beautiful palace made of coral that was filled with murals depicting a storm. Over there was a throne embedded with sappires, emeralds, and lustrous pearls above a nine-stepped staircase that was nine meters above the ground. He looked over and saw a woman in a complicated dress sitting on it. Alger's dream was both blurry and clear at the same time. The woman's appearance was blurry, as well as the details of the murals and coral palace, but her eyes that contained lightning and her sharp ears were clear. Under the effects of the Blood Moon, her relics resonated with the Ocean Songster Beyonder characteristic I have, resulting in it influencing my dream. The Book of Calamity \"She\" left behind has likely been sent to Pasu Island. When I pass by Bayam, I should find the actual spot to take a look... Also, isn't our Tarot Club's archenemy the Aurora Order? Isn't Mr. Fool always targeting the True Creator? Why did it change no-why for the additional Rose School of Thought? He wasn't surprised he had a demigod under \"Him?\" He was convinced that Mr Fool had a High-Sequence Blessed!Thankfully, things would be troublesome...Alger listened in silence without asking any questions. After daybreak, he didn't show any signs of abnormality. He entered a room with a long table, and he was questioned by three Mandated Punisher deacons. Only one of them possessed dark blue hair. This was because this wasn't a necessary change that would happen from consuming the Sailor pathway potion. However, this trait would quite stubbornly be passed down, just like the elves.

She convinced Walter, and of course Klein. This was because renting a high-end carriage with the horse costs only 88 pounds, and a two-wheeled carriage costs only 42 pounds.

The scene in front of her shattered, as if everything was an illusion. Trissy realized that she was still standing on the window sill, still looking over the grassy field and the steel fence. The captain of the Nighthawks was hunched over as he pressed down on his glabella, his eyes closed as formless ripples spread outwards from him. Formless, transparent figures were numbly pacing around every corner of the building in a daze. The altar was a round table, with a figurine of a deity carved out of bone placed in the center. This figurine was about the size of a grown man's head, with only a mere indication of her eyes, but the figure was that of a beautiful woman. She understood that everything that had happened was just a dream. She had fallen asleep unknowingly!Bang! Bang! bang! Leonard Mitchell and Frye fired three shots, accurately hitting the invisible target who was still waking up from her reverie. She struck quickly, plunging the dagger into Frye's lower back. She followed the corridor and the steps, sprinting all the way to the first floor. She could no longer control her shivers when she finally reached the sacrificial altar. It was unknown when a dagger smeared with \u2018black paint' appeared in her hand. Trissy bowed at the deity's figurine and quickly recited her incantations. She extinguished the flames of the candles before picking the figurine up. Names and relevant information were written on the puppets; for example, Joyce Mayer. The winds howled fiercely as they shook the closed windows violently. Trissy did not stop. With the flower in hand, she nimbly made her way over the steel fence and escaped in the direction of the Tussock River. She managed to fool the Spirit Visions of the Nighthawks and escape the pincer attack. Leonard Mitchell was also hit by the cold sinister winds infused with the intense sensation of death. His teeth chattered, making it hard for him to enunciate his poems. He pulled up his sleeve and looked at the wound caused by the flower. The wound had already stopped, but there was some red swelling that remained. He did not pause but recited something silently, he pulled his finger out and pulled his fingernail straight out. He was a Sequence 9 Beyonder, but as a Corpse Collector, he was no stranger to such situations. He fired a shot at the spreading vines, causing dark red liquid to ooze out. The vines retracted abruptly from where he had previously stood, as if hiding from something invisible. He could only pull back his shoulder and raise his arm. The black shadow smashed into his forearm, the thorns on its body piercing his skin. When the fingernail was dyed with his dark red blood, he pulled out a few strands of hair from his scalp and wrapped it in his hair. He saw it burn and release a foul stench. He entered the first level through the window and said to Dunn and Frye who were destroying the altar, \"The target has escaped. But it's alright, our primary objective was to stop the ritual.\" Dunn sighed and looked at the puppets on the table. \"She was very cautious and very powerful. She sensed us approaching her ahead of time, otherwise... she should be, at the very least, a Sequence 7 Beyonder. Ask Klein to come over.\" He said to Klein. \"Give Klein the signal. Ask him to come to me. I need to talk to you.\" Klein said, \"Yes, I will come to you\" and left the room. The two of them went to the Tussock River where Trissy was swimming. Trissy submerged herself in the river and burned the flower in her hand to ashes. She was chanting something as a ball of black, illusory fire suddenly appeared in her palm. The flames enveloped the flower, burning it to ashes and leaving only some dust behind. The fingernails and hair disappeared quickly, leaving only a small amount of dust behind and some dust on the floor. The pair returned to the first floor and destroyed the altar and puppets."}

Then, he found The Fool card and placed it on a piece of paper. On it, he wrote three names: \"Sherlock Moriarty, Gehrman Sparrow, Dwayne Dant\u00e8s\" After some hesitation, Leonard drew a line linking the three names to The Fool, indicating that they might very well be members of a secret organization that believed in The Fool. He took out the crazy adventurer's records and began reading them seriously. He found a date very familiar. It was in early January! He drew a gasp as he flipped through another set of documents. At the end of it were the words: \"At theend of December, Sherlock Moriarty left Backlund and headed south for a vacation.

He then placed two candles and turned to the side and looked at Klein, saying very solemnly, \"Low-Sequence Beyonders are not strong enough.

A thin mist emanated as everything seemed to become veiled in mystery. Old Neil closed his eyes again as he seemed to sense the burning of the IOU. He opened his eyes after a moment and looked toward the black Sacred Emblem on the cauldron. The parchment was already completely incinerated. He extinguished the candles in the opposite order as he lit them. After finishing everything, he used the silver knife to rip apart the invisible wall around him. \"It's done,\" he said. \"That's it?\" Klein asked in a daze. \"Has the Iou been settled?

Then, she walked to the Elven Songster's side. Under her guidance, Mobet's figure in the garden rapidly blurred as he vanished from Siatas's dream. The scene that was restored was no longer a garden, but that of a palace made of coral. The entire structure was tall and majestic, but due to the layers of blue seawater, the sky couldn't be seen, making it appear dark and gloomy. On the nine steps, there were two huge chairs that seemed to be formed purely of lightning. One of them occupied the center, just like the ruler of this palace. The other was on its left, appearing less eye-catching. The couple was the Elf King, the ancient god, Soniathrym, and a beautiful woman with raven-black hair. Her hair was tied up into a high bun, her ears slightly pointed, and her facial features delicate. She had dark brown eyes that were as deep as the ocean, and in her hands, she was playing with a complicated golden wine cup. \"He\" said in a thunderous voice, \"I thought that, after centuries, \u2018He' would understand the global situation even more. I've overestimated \u2018His' intelligence!\" The ancient god, Soniathrym, scoffed and said, \"Recently, Aurmir wanted to work with some secret sects that have sprouted from the humans to deal with us.

He saw that Miss Messenger had already floated over, looking like \"She\" was facing a terrifying enemy. And the surrounding darkness froze like a cold lake. Lightning stopped streaking across the sky. The cloak formed by the \"curtain\" lost its support and fell back onto the ground.

He then entered the fog of history and dashed all the way to a time before the First Epoch. He relied on the prayers he had yet to reply to and instantly entered the world above the gray fog through the summoning of Sefirah Castle. As the roars and the ravings echoed, he felt the corrosion in his Spirit Body gather together, curling into a ball. Despite passing through layers of cleansing effects, it managed to maintain its stability and didn't completely evaporate. It wouldn't mutate, send a message to the True Creator, or interfere with what he did. It would only continue to steer him via mystic means towards the Giant King's Court.

He also wanted to steal the corresponding powers of the Beyonder at the same time to increase the success rate of stealing his target's powers. Klein turned his left palm and tapped the edge of the long mottled table. A transparent vortex-like \"door\" appeared in the abnormal void and opened up in front of the black palm. The palm formed by the shadows rapidly passed through the open \"door,\" and entered the concealed space. It grabbed Bernadettes neck and once again disrupted the connection between Queen Mystic and her Sealed Artifact, distorting the corresponding order. It seemed to be studying Sefirah and Klein through the fog of space and fog. The different gems on the Staff of the Stars turned abnormally heavy and lit up at same time. The black figure raised its head and looked at the top of the mausolesum. The light-yellow oil on its surface looked like it was soaked in light- yellow oil. The dark palm didn't exert too much strength, but it madeBernadette feel cold. It felt like she was speaking to the air. The shadow had a certain understanding of where he was and felt that it was distorting something. He had also requested Miss Magician to \"Record\" the He didn't even get anything. His target had long since escaped the lock-on, despite just standing there! Then, he saw the black figure flash and enter the concealed space. At that moment, Bernadette, who was unable to use her Sealed Artifact, grew white, illusory swan feathers on her back. This was her fairytale magic's \"Ugly Duckling\" It could make Bernadettes reveal an incomplete Mythical Creature form while maintaining her clarity of mind. Should could use it twice a day, with each use lasting fifteen seconds. She grabbed the final moment of lucidity and opened her mouth slightly, speaking in a fluent Chinese accent: \"Home...\" The black shadow's infiltration paused for a moment. Its upper body slowly rose as it looked at Bernadnette. It was sticky like a viscous, corrosive liquid that seeped into her body. It caused her \"U ugly duckling\" magic to be cut off before it could even show its effects. Almost at the same time, she saw the shadow stick to her body, causing her thoughts to boil and become more chaotic. She started to talk in a Chinese accent, saying: \"I'm home. I'm home.\" The shadow looked at her and said: \"What do you want?\" She replied: \"To be with you, my love. I love you so much. I'll always be here for you.\""}
{"num_chp":570,"summary":"Audrey noticed The Hermit's subtle motion. This left her somewhat suspicious. Mr. Hanged Man was clearly mentioning something that had little to do with everyone. He was talking about the so-called Sea God Kalvetua's ability to occasionally reply to its believers despite its apparent death. Ma'am Hermit is looking at Mr. Fool... Could it be...Audrey's eyes lit up as she came to a conclusion. Why would she suddenly turn to look at him? She knows that the current \"Sea God\" is a manifestation of Mr. fool.Derrick didn't know who Sea GodKalvetua was, nor did he understand what it meant for it to respond to its. believers even after its death. However, since everyone was looking at him, he naturally looked over as well. The Magician Fors and Emlyn began guessing at the reason as they cast their gaze to the end of the long bronze table. The World was late by a second, as though he was deliberating over something. Then, he changed the direction of his gaze. He first scanned The Hanging Man, making him shudder in fear. He then joined her in looking towards Mr. Frodo, who was shrouded in the grayish-white fog. The choice was to neither admit or deny anything, so as to prevent him from losing his standing as a god. But that doesn't convince me. It feels like there's a deeper truth hidden behind this matter... Alger finally verified that the present \"Sea God\" was a manifestation of The Fool. \"He\" has truly begun interfering with the real world? This is great! In the future, I can pray to Sea God directly and receive a response when I'm out traveling at sea?Audrey felt surprised, overjoyed, and proud. The Hermit's unsurprised reaction implies that she had long interacted with Mr. Fool and had learned of certain things ahead of time. This implies that her Sequence isn't low. She might really be a powerhouse at the pirate admiral level... This is both good and bad news for me. At times, we can tacitly cooperate and complete matters that were previously deemed unimaginable. The bad news is that a lot of my news and resource channels will be overshadowed by hers. My purpose in the Tarot Club will drastically decline. Of course, that's under the premise that she really is Admiral of Stars. The World conjured a picture with The Fool's help to both sides of the table and asked, \"Does anyone know her?\" It was a picture of the red-haired Helene Klein of the Stars of Cattleya. The Hanged Man Alger mainly wanted to know if her or The Hanging Man Alger knew her. The Little Sun isn't the Queen of Calamity; otherwise, he wouldn't have such a reaction if Cohinem was Queen ofCalamity. Alger was about to say that he didn't know her, he heard Ma'am Hermit say with a deep voice, \"Red-haired Helene. She's from a fallen noble family and has the bloodline from the Intis's Sauron family.\" Cattleya paused before adding, \"She was once a trader out at sea, but she was later said to have been abducted by Ailment Maiden Tracy.\" The Hermit is rather aware of matters over at Intis. But that doesn't imply anything. Beyonders of a certain Sequence or knowledgeable people will know who the seven pirate admirals are. Their bounty posters are everywhere. This is something that can be determined for now... The Hanged Man wasn't interested in red-hair Helene, only The Hermits real identity. Audrey began considering if she should consult the others about the mind dragon. After a brief deliberation, she said, \"I recently sought out the traces of a mind dragon and went to a place which has the tradition of worshiping dragons.\" She had concealed the exact location as the details might implicate her. The Hanging Man was not interested in the matter, only the identity of the Hermit. This left her hesitant. She had only said a few sentences without continuing. To her regret, Ma'Am Hermit had only spoken a few words before she had to leave the room. She didn't want to reveal her true identity."}

To them, be it the framing of Baron Syndras, the assault on Member of Parliament Macht, or Dwayne Dant\u00e8s's donation of more than ten thousand pounds, they weren't something that needed special notice. However, to have Mr. Fool's Blessed choose to accept the investigation mission meant that the problem was bound to be extremely complicated. It made them feel that there were important secrets underlying the matter. Audrey moved her gaze to The World and asked with hidden anticipation, \"Mr. World, you wish to receive this mission?\" The World replied, \"Yes, I would like to take the mission, however, I will need to ask Miss Justice to help me with it.\" The World then took the mission and returned to Backlund, where it was revealed that Mr. World was the crazy adventurer, Gehrman Sparrow. The mission was completed and the two members were reunited, but they didn't know each other and had to tacitly work together to complete a specified mission together to accomplish a complete goal. It was very difficult in reality, but its success was more effective and less worrisome than her most effective and effective lie. The World was now back at Backlund and the investigation was over. The investigation was now over and it was time to move on. Fors was shocked when she learned that Dwayne Dant\u00e8s is Mr. World. The Magician had used Leymano's Travels before and had added demigod-level Beyonder powers to it. He had definitely observed me in secret, remembering my appearance and evaluating my value. Fors was thankful that she hadn't left a comment in her note that he should check on his kidneys or bladder. She suspected that she wouldn't be able to participate in the next Tarot Gathering. Or perhaps, she would appear in the form of a Beyonder characteristic, sold to the other members by The World. It was her first meeting with another member of the Tarot Club! Yes, this feels like a historic moment as well as Mr Fool's other Blessed Eh Eh Eh! It's like a dream come true! I'm so happy to be with you, Audrey! I love you so much! You're the best person I've ever met! I'll always love you! You'll always be in my heart, Audrey. You're so special to me! I can't wait to meet you again! I've been waiting for you for a long time. I'll never forget you! I will miss you so, forever! You are my best friend! You've made me so happy! You make me feel so, so special! I won't ever forget you. I will always love You! You will always be my friend! Dwayne Dant\u00e8s was the amalgamation of Mr. Fool's Blessed and Justice from the Tarot Club. Audrey felt that the kingdom's upper echelons are beginning to stir in a state of unrest. She would accept her father's choice to join the Loen Charity Bursary Foundation, then she inwardly quipped,Wouldn't it be very logical to have Justice fromthe Tarot club join the charity foundation established by Mr. World from theTarot Club?Something major is about to happen in Backlund! Audrey thought to herself as she thought about the identity of Dwayne Dants\u00e8s. She was not too surprised that he was The World, but another thought flashed through their minds: Something major is going to happen soon in the kingdom. She thought about it for a few seconds, and then decided to go and find out what was going on. She went and found out that Dwayne was the son of Baron Syndras and the daughter of Member of Parliament Macht, and that he had donated money to establish a bursary foundation. She also learned that he is also the father of the Queen of Backlund, who is a member of Parliament. Audrey decided to join him in the foundation, reducing the risk that her parents might suffer, and also the risk of the innocent. She then went to find out more about Dwayne's identity, and why he was chosen to be The World and the Queen's son."}

This meant that he had returned to the real world, the place with all kinds of delicacies. At this point, the servants must've discovered the disappearance of their mate, and they would definitely inform the priests and bishops. The identity of Dwayne Dant\u00e8s hasn't been exposed yet. He took out the iron cigar case, which appeared to be inside his pocket, but was actually lodged under a rubber band. He opened it and took out a gold coin inside. He set a sacrificial ritual, preparing to send Creeping Hunger, Azik's whistle, and the various mysticism materials above the gray fog above the town. After the ritual, the mirror was restored to normal and Klein walked to the bedside and pulled out the pajamas underneath. The Fool's seat didn't delay and he sat at the seat at 160 B\u00f6klund Street. His figure finally appeared in his room. The curtains were drawn tightly and it was dim. It was very suitable for sleeping. He was lying on the bed facing up. His hands were grabbing the ends of the blanket near his neck. The silver on the mirror's surface changed and produced new words: \"Exalted Great Master, did you encounter something?\" \"It wasn't anything important,\" Klein answered perfunctorily. \"You may leave. I'll summon Creeping Hunger could now Graze seven souls. During each Grazing process, it could obtain two or three Beyonder powers. One of them can be chosen by the wearer. There are currently eight souls inside Creeping Hunger. The others completely dissipated from the mutation brought about by the Attendant of Mysteries. And due to the excessive number of souls, it caused a \"congestion,\" making some of the powers unusable. One soul needs to be released to restore it back to normal. The chance of success has been increased. Although it's still very troublesome, eight times or so would be needed as long as I'm not too unlucky. The effects slowly become severe. In the beginning, it might be oversensitive skin, a cold, or a fever. But twenty to thirty seconds later, it may very well turn into serious illnesses like pneumonia. After 2 or 3 minutes, one can suddenly suffer cardiac arrest or a brain aneurysm. There is an unknown Wind-blessed woman with powers-Short distance Flight, Dive, and Water Control. An unknown Doctor with the powers of forcefully pulling a dream and causing a Spirit Body to sleep. Anunknown Demoness of Affliction with the power of distinguishing three Beyonders at the same time, stitching the time of the treatment, stitching souls, and stitching the same souls at same time. A Spirit World Plunderer who can turn the hearts of people within ten meters dark and greedy, making Creeping Hunger had to eat a living person every day, otherwise it would devour the wearer. At the same time, it would praise the True Creator from time to time in the wearer's mind. It would bring about chaotic thoughts and a headache. It was also still afraid of mushrooms. No powers could be used if mushrooms appeared within five meters of it. He also planned on swapping the Wind-blessed and Doctor later. The Demoness of Affliction depended on the circumstances. He then quickly returned to the real world, ended the ceremony, and cleared up any traces. He washed his face and brushed his teeth to make Dwayne Dant\u00e8s look sharp. After leaving the bathroom, Klein, in his pajamas, walked to the door with his usual expression. He pulled open the door and said to his valet outside, \"Prepare a set of clothes that's suitable for home wear.\" \"Yes, sir.\" Richardson didn't ask why as he immediately walked to a wardrobe and took out a pair of clothes. The next day, Klein went back to his normal life and returned to his office. He didn't hesitate to throw Creeping Hunger and the other items into the junk pile. His Beyonder characteristic was produced. At its core was pure shimmering light that looked like a night sky with embedded stars.

In recent months, Miss Magician was repeatedly surprised by The World. He was first capable of obtaining rather important information, and following that, he sold plenty of Beyonder characteristics in a short span of time. He made her involuntarily suspect if he was a Beyonder assassin who was active in the mysterious world. She feared him from the bottom of her heart, but along with that came happiness. This was because it meant that she could commission Mr. World with certain requests that would be met with high chances of success. The World and Mr. Fool had a connection to a certain degree, but she wasn't able to confirm it, as there were just too many possibilities. The winner will receive a prize that's likely something that will allow a Sanguine to become stronger...Emlyn White quickly turned his thoughts back to himself. He had no idea what he saw, other than guesses about the situation from his looks. Admiral Hurricane Qilangos had long knew the primitive island and found the ancient ruins of it. And previously, he was also the one who thought off this pirate while he was away at sea... Mr Hanged Man isn't an ordinary member of the Church of Storms, he hides many secrets. Klein controlled The World to appear to be in thought as he attempted to obtain more information from The Hanged Man. He said, \"On the island, there are traces of demigod-level Beyonder creatures. To you, that should be something valuable\" The World didn't hesitate as he chuckled. \"Deal.\" The Hermit tersely acknowledged and, without wasting any time, looked at Audrey. \"The Black-hunting Giant Lizard's spinal fluid has been confirmed. There are temporarily no clues for the Illusory Chime Tree's fruit.\" Audrey sincerely thanked her without even minding the price. After confirming the two members, Cattleya surveyed the members as though she was one of them. \"Are you referring to a pure Mythical Creature? There are impure Mythical Creatures?\" The World chuckled with a hoarse voice. \"Yes, I am. PureMythical Creature is an angel, which means one means an angel of the blood of an angel.\" Audrey was taken aback by what she had heard, but she was also intrigued by what they were talking about. \"So, what are your plans for the future?\" she asked. \"I have a few ideas, but I'm going to have to wait until tomorrow to tell you them.\" The World nodded. \"Alright. We will do the transaction tomorrow at this time.\" The pair left for the gathering, and the Hermit said that she had already obtained the crystallized Derrick wanted to buy the crystallized roots of the Tree of Elders and the feathers of a Spirit Pact Bird. He also sought to purchase the Golden-edged Sunflower and other supplementary ingredients. He suspected that The World would seek Mr. Fool's angel for a drop of blood. The other Tarot Club members fell silent. They never expected The World to have clues to an angel's blood! What can't he accomplish?Audrey, Fors, and company had their impression of Mr. World refreshed again. He was relatively at ease, having already owed a debt to The World. He had already learned where the crystallised roots were. He didn't want an item obtained from a transaction to overlap with the prize of the hunting competition. He thought and said, \"A Beyonder characteristic of a Sequence 5 Vampire?\" It was quite a commonly seen monster in the depths of the darkness. \"Sanguine!\" Emlyn said through gritted teeth. \"There's no rush. I'll tell you when I've decided what I need. One drop is enough.\" He was motivated to work hard because he was burdened with debt.

The other was to summon the messenger of mysterious origins and place the blood inside a bottle, sending it over with a letter. He found an ascetic from the Third Epoch. He hopes to learn the history of that epoch through his dream. Leonard's heart stirred as he looked forward to the proposal that Klein raised. \"Get me a few drops of your blood when you return. This is necessary to explore the dreams.\" He didn't specifically mention how to give the blood to him. \"For now, don't mention this matter to Pallez Zoroast.\" Leonard grumbled inwardly as he replied, \"There's no need to remind me.\" \"I can roughly guess what you're going on,\" Klein asked. \"What I see is equivalent to what you see...\" Leonard mumbled, Of course, the most important thing is to be wary of you. \"I shouldn't see you in the dream, so he must be prepared\" \"Of course, your former colleague is protected by an existence of Concealment. Don't you want to know what you actually are?\" Klein asked Leonard. \"Don't you actually not the least bit curious about the true deities in the ThirdEpoch, or the cause of the Cataclysm?\" Leonard scoffed. \"You took too much initiative to control the flow of our conversation today. This means that you have a secret you're hiding deep down. Not bad, it's much better than the past. At least it's not something that can be seen through at once.\"Leonard's expression froze. \"See, I just gave it a try and you exposed yourself. You still lack training. Your former colleague is really... Tsk...\" He put down his cup and leaned forward. He then picked up a silver ritual dagger and cut open a wound, causing a few drops of blood to drip out. Meanwhile at Earl Hall's residence, Audrey was also holding a dagger with gems embedded in it. She was preparing to fulfill the promise of providing help for free. She moved the tip of the dagger towards the back of her hand. As she hypnotized herself, she exerted force and toreopen a wound. The pain was very mild.

After the exploration of the four people's subconscious via their dreams, they would then enter the sea of collective subconscious in search of any possible secrets.

After some slight adjustments, Klein made it lie in bed as though it was already sleeping. Then, he took out a long metal vial and threw it at him. The servant caught it and pulled out the stopper before gulping down the soporific medicine in it. In a few seconds, he fell into a deep slumber as Senor surfaced to the side. Klein quickly changed into those clothes and moved the items from the cigar case over the area before returning to the gold coin. He watched as an indescribable transparency effect produced an Creeping Hunger effect. After teleporting back to the shadowy corner, Klein bent his back and began cleaning the area.

Before long, servants began leaving the cathedral with all sorts of miscellaneous items, walking to the trash bins in an alley Klein pretended to look uninterested in the conversation due to his fatigue as he tersely nodded without participating. The servants were all exhausted and before long, they fell asleep, producing a symphony of snores. The Keeper, who was in deep sleep, lost control over his body before he could even wake up to resist. All he could do was rely on Cogitation to force himself to sleep for a few hours. He woke up at a specific time and released Senor. Klein made the Wraith use the stained glass windows high above and the bright stone floor tiles to arrive at the staircase that led to the Keepers above. He believed that if Senor hadn't been contaminated ahead of time, making Chanis Gate's core seal think of it as one of its own, it definitely would've reacted and cleansed it. Klein had long figured out the roster, so he made the dark-red coated Wraith stealthily pass through the wooden door and float into different rooms to identify the target. He quickly found the pale elder with loose facial skin, sparse hair, and a big nose. He immediately took out a sedative vial and placed it to the side. Then, before the Keeper sensed anything, it possessed him! The Wraith's body convulsed abnormally as his organs seemed to be engaged in a violent struggle. After doing all of this, the body of the Keeper and Senor used all kinds of surfaces to leap back to the servants' Klein woke up ahead of time, finished the white bread he had prepared the night before and drank a cup of water. He went to the first floor, and following the path he had previously verified, he took a left turn. After walking for a moment, he wasn't surprised to see a priest. The priest stood outside a secret door that led underground. As he raised his right hand, he tapped four times clockwise on his chest and said, \"May the Goddess bless you.\" Klein replied hoarsely and similarly drew a crimson moon.

He believed that turning right would leave the cathedral, and it would likely lead to the disguised security company or other organization belonging to the Nighthawks.

The baby was born healthy, but the baby's mother was later killed by the Saint's Aiety.

As for Faceless and Marionettist, one can easily get lost while acting. It's relatively easy to lose control when one advances, making it rather dangerous. If one has a sealed Creeping Hunger, it would be perfect. Klein casually thought as he recalled CreepingHunger which had landed in Amon's hands. He didn't know how Amon would treat this Sealed Artifact, but he only felt that an item of this level was of no value to an Angel of Time. After sighing, Klein suddenly recalled something and hurriedly got the Worms of Spirit on duty in Sefirsah Castle to \"Graft\" a certain area in the spirit world he fixed when he advanced over.

The giant white rabbit got off the high stool and stood up. \"You know how to get into the Garden of Eden,\" it said. \"From this day forth, Alger shall wear a mask and become the pontiff of the Church of the Sea God,\" the Oracle replied. \"Or you can combine the two methods,\" the rabbit said, before disappearing into a grayish-white fog. \"The Church of Storms has switched cardinals,\" said the intel supervisor. \"It's said that he was transferred back to their headquarters,\" the supervisor recounted. \"That's what I learned from some of the servants at the Cathedral of Waves,\" said Danitz. \"I don't know what to do,\" he said, \"I've never been so scared in my life.\" \"I'm afraid I'm going to have to kill you,\" the cardinals replied. 'I'm sorry,' Danitz said, 'I didn't mean to offend you. I'm just so scared.' 'I've got to get out of here,' said the cardinal. 'You're not going to get away with it, are you?' 'No, I'm not,' replied the cardinal. 'It's not your fault. It's my fault that I didn't get the message.' 'What do you want from me?' asked the Oracle. 'Don't ask me"}
{"num_chp":120,"summary":"\"There is the presence of supernatural factors...\" Klein's eyes returned to normal, and he looked at Leonard and Frye. He then took out the bottles of pure dew, essential oils, and herbal powder. Then, he quickly set up the mediumship ritual. He entered the dreamland whilst standing and \u2018saw' a translucent spirit lingering around the corpse. He extended his illusory right hand to touch Mrs. Lauwis's remaining spirituality. As the blurriness shattered, Klein left the dreamworld and returned to reality. He dispelled the wall of spirituality and said to the waiting Frye and amused Leonard, \"That's for now, let's head over to the workhouse in West Borough. We'll see if we can find other clues to the cause of her death\" He then turned around and said, \"Her death was caused by a natural heart disease. There's no doubt about it.\" He then walked to the side of the door, paused for quite a while before saying, 'That's it for now. Let's head to the head of the West Borough workhouse. We've got a lot of work to do!\" He then left the room and went back to his office. The next day, he and Leonard went to West Borough and started work on a new project. The project was to find a cure for a rare, life-threatening disease. The result was a successful cure for the disease. The law requiring a cemetery burial had been established more than a thousand years ago, at the end of the previous Epoch. The seven major churches and imperial households from each country had approved the law in order to cut down on the number of water ghosts, zombies, and restless wraiths. But even so, the truly poor still couldn't afford it. The three Nighthawks and Bitsch Mountbatten took a turn to the nearby workhouse in West Borough. The place was packed with people in tattered clothes with numb expressions. They only occasionally looked towards the door of the workhouse impatiently. It was just like when the people from the Foodaholic Empire on earth queued for a shop that gone viral on the Internet. The workhouse was transformed from an old church into an old workhouse. There were hammocks and mattresses all over the Mass hall. The pastor was once a once a pastor in a workhouse of the Goddess, but he maintained his cold attitude. He said, \"I've left you money for the burial next to your wife.\" After saying those words in absolute calmness, he exited the apartment directly, unbothered by Lauwis's shocked expression and gratitude that followed him. The Nighthawk's story is told in the book, \"The Three Nighth Hawks,\" by Leonard Klein, published by Simon & Schuster, priced \u00a316.99, with an MSRP of \u00a312.99. The Poor Law established in 1336 enforced a rule whereby every poor person can only stay in the workhouse for five days at most. Any longer than that, one would be cast out. During the five days, they have to do manual labor, such as breaking rocks or picking oakum. These are the same tasks that criminals in prison do,\" Frye explained to Klein and Leonard briefly without much emotion. \"When they leave this workhouse, they could go to another one. Of course, they might not be able to move in. Heh, perhaps, to some people, poor people are like criminals,\" said Frye. \"It seems that Salus long had the idea to take revenge and self-destruct. It seems to be a very normal case,\" said Leonard. \"Let's eliminate Salus's fire case temporarily,\" Leonard concluded. \"For example, maybe there is another possibility. For example, a Beyonder who didn't take any supernatural measures.\" \"It's very possible,such as the Instigator from before!\" said Klein. \"Instigator Tris!\" said Leonard, thinking, \"But that wouldn't have any connection with Mrs. Lauwis's death...He thought, creasing his eyebrows lightly. \"That wouldn't be the case at all!\" he said, thinking. \"The Instigator would be the one who started the fire and set the house on fire.\" \"Yes,\" said the director. \"Yes.\""}

Since he had nearly died at the hands of Steel Maveti and now had the chance to take revenge, he definitely wouldn't miss it! He believed that he could survive in the pirate industry by relying on an accurate grasp of the situation. He thought for a while and finally remembered what he had to do.Write down everything that Admiral of Blood and his pirate crew had done. Then he said in a tone as though he was giving instructions on what was to be eaten tomorrow morning, \"Tell me about the Admiral of blood and his men.\" Danitz was delighted, hating himself for not knowing enough. He wrote down everything they had done, and Klein confirmed from the undetailed parts of Danitz's description that he was the most typical and vile of pirates. Not only did they plunder, but they also abducted people, slaughtered crew members, and abused women. Anyone who has encountered him has died a bizarre death. Either they strangle themselves to death, blow their mouths up, hug bombs, or slaughter their companions. Captain said that it's the possession of an evil spirit. It's very similar to Miss Sharron's Beyonder powers... Wraith?Klein didn't speak as he listened to Danitz go on, in silence. He then said, \"The highest probability is that \"I've never directly fought Senor, so that's all I know.\" Danitz wanted to throw his hands up, but he was stopped by the pain in his left arm. \"He has about seven or eight ships. His flagship is the Tree of Flesh and Blood. We mainly seek out treasure and wouldn't take in anyone. Therefore, we only have the Golden Dream.\" It's no wonder the Admiral of Blood's bounty is much higher than Vice Admiral Iceberg, reaching 42,000 pounds... In terms of strength, he should be a bit stronger...Klein immediately gained an understanding. It's from the Monster pathway? Or is it connected to some other evil spirit?Klein guessed based on his own knowledge of mysticism. He didn't give up just because this matter might involve the Rose School of Thought. In any case, he could change his face and identity afterwards. And I can take advantage of this period to explore the possibility of true acting...Soon, Klein formulated a plan as he continued to listen to Danitz tell him about the rest of Admiral's subordinates. Once it's spread, this matter will definitely go on the papers, and I no longer need to worry about informing their ranks that a traitor was among their ranks. He was afraid that all points of contact were under the enemy's control, Therefore he didn't dare make contact to rashly make contact with them. He had involved himself with the Aurora Order, the Demoness Sect, Alger Wilson, who had received the Sanguine's anesthetic gas, was about to sail out to sea for another of the Wind-blessed's main ingredients, when he was summoned by the local diocese bishop. \"There have been rumors recently that Vice Admiral Iceberg received Death's Key. All the pirates in the Sonia Sea are roused by this,\" the bishop said in a heavy voice. \"Investigate this matter.\" Alger decided to visit the few places where pirates roamed. He planned to put on a show of working hard by trying to seek out information. \"Tonight, Gehrman joins the hunt,\" he muttered to himself in a low voice, thinking of the punch that had nearly pierced his heart in the evening. \"I don't have the right to be involved. Such rumors are commonly spread across the sea... Even if it's true, I'll just go through the motions and skirt the edge of this matter... There's no need to take the risk.\" \"May the Storm be with you!\" The encouraged Alger Wilson quickly left the cathedral and returned to the square outside. \"The storm last night had subsided, and only the scattered leaves and water puddles on the ground remained as evidence of its coming.

At the same time, Reinette Tinekerr left the gold coin in Klein's pocket and floated towards the eight-legged demonic wolf. \"She\" kept moving at high speeds, waving \"Her\" sharp claws as \"She's\" engaged in an intense battle with the hill-like Dark Demonic Wolf. \"He\" had successfully hidden underground to avoid the lightning bombardment. The independent \"kingdom\" created by the \"curtain\" had completely disintegrated. However, the Dark demonic Wolf's wish hadn't completely expired. The return of godhood still needed some time. \"Him\" could no longer swap locations with his marionette. He was about to all together collide with the huge brown bear. He jumped up and kicked the brown bear and flew past the diagonally crossed. He then swung his black staff down and ruthlessly struck the bear's shoulder. The brown bear didn't back down. It spread open its arms, trying to give him a \"passionate\" hug that could crush all his bones and squeeze his chest muscles. Klein didn't retreat-he didn't want to hurt the thick of the hide of the bear. With the Staff of the Stars, the physical attack would lead to random abnormal changes or strange effects. Under the God of Wishes's suppression, these changes and effects wouldn't exceed that of a Sequence 4 Beyonder power. After Sefirah Castle's anomaly, time became abnormally precious. No one was willing to stall for time, because it wouldn't be long before high-level existences like the True Creator and Angel of Time Amon in the Forsaken Land of the Gods descended. The Dark Demonic Wolf Kotar trembled violently and flung out the translucent velvet curtain. The curtain first vanished into thin air before it suddenly appeared behind Klein. Just as his spirituality was about to send a warning, it covered him and wrapped him within it! The curtain then disappeared. The staff lit up and the gems embedded in it lit up. A pure white and holy pillar of light descended from the sky, enveloping the black gas and the corresponding marionette. The poison quickly melted under the Sun's burning. It was the same with the marionettes of the Dark demonic Wolf. Klein had finished off the remainingMarionettes in just a few seconds. He then turned around and aimed his staff at the brown bear that was split into two. The brown bear's internal organs and blood gushed to the ground in a rather shocking scene. Its two halves were squirming as it struggled to stabilize his center of mass and continued attacking. Its body finally collapsed, unable to get Reinette Tinekerr immediately \"jumped\" and appeared on the translucent \"curtain,\" purging it from Klein's body and teleporting elsewhere. The Dark Demonic Wolf seized the opportunity and raised \"His\" neck, letting out a roar. \"He\" launched repeated attacks on Klein, forcing Reinette to block them. More and more wounds appeared, making it look like \"She\" could not last any longer. At this critical moment, as Klein controlled the Spirit Body Threads to resist the attraction of the \"cloak,\" he reached into his pocket and took out another iron cigar case. Inside, there was a gold coin lying quietly. There was also a Wraith on the surface of the gold coin. On it were nearly illusory black tubes that extended into infinity, connecting to the unknown. This was the symbol of Artificial Death. It was the reenactment of the time when the Evernight Goddess had used God of Glory Bladel's corpse to foil Amon's attempt to snatch Sefirah Castle. For this, he deliberately found a wraith-like monster in the Forsaken Land of the Gods and imprisoned it, placing it together with the Artificial Death project's white feathers he summoned from the fog of history.

{"num_chp":1114,"summary":"The expedition team traveled through the Waning Forest to find the Unshadowed Crucifix. As they entered the forest, they saw two grayish-white, mottled tombstones. They also saw a gigantic figure that was nearly ten meters tall. The figure was very blurry and contained an everlasting and imperturbable air to it. It was like a mythical figure from a mythical era. Its face was stained like the setting sun as though it was a manifestation of its eyes. Just its existence alone had caused the surrounding trees and the void around it to begin waning uncontrollably. The expedition team surfaced by the bit by the goosebumps emitted by the skin of the members of the expedition team. The team was able to retrieve the Sealed Artifact and return it to the City of Silver. The mission was a success and the team were able to return the Artifact to the city of Silver after a few days. The group then returned to their base to prepare for the next phase of the mission. The final mission was to find out what the Un shadow was really all about and what it meant to be a part of the city. The adventure ended with a victory for the team and the return of the Se sealed Artifact and the victory over the evil spirit of the ancient King Aurgo. The Expedition team was then able to leave the city and return to the base to continue their mission in the future. The journey was completed by the team's leader Derrick Berg. Demon Hunter Colin Iliad held two swords that were smeared with ointment, and he ran towards that terrifying figure like a hurricane at high speeds. The giant sword that seemed like a manifestation of dusk itself was suddenly swung forward. An orange-red storm of light suddenly took form and swept towards Demon Hunter Colin, as well as Derrick and company who were right behind him. Everything began waning in an irreversible manner as a path was drawn out. The figure with a dark red glow near its eyes genuflected and stabbed an illusory greatsword into the ground, creating an unusually strong and invisible wall. In the Waning Domain, he didn't dare release his Mythical Creature form, because it was very likely that there was no way of reversing it. Derrick pressed his finger against the Unshadowed Crucifix. A vigorous and bright light churned out, flying into the air and turning downwards, instantly enveloping the figure in silver-gray armor. The silver-white figure didn't suffer any damage, and the silver- gray armor that was covered in blood spots only dimmed a little. After rounds, the figure that seemed to have transmigrated from time to time had finally begun to crumble, being reduced to burning orange dots of light. After many years of the Giant King's will to protect this area, it has a certain degree of strength and strength and a certain level of strength that can't be reversed. It's a type of evil spirit. After thousands of years, it's still as terrifying as ever. What would a real ancient god be like... Uh, why would \"He\" have such a strong will to protect this? Is it because it's where \"His\" parents are buried? As Derrick heaved a sigh of relief, he followed the Chief and company towards the tomb while being plagued with puzzlement and curiosity. The first thing he saw was two ancient mottled tombstones. On them were the words \"Father\" and \"Mother\" in Jotun. Behind the stone pillar was a grave, but it had already been destroyed, revealing two black coffins underneath. It was unknown who had opened the lids of the coffins, as though a confirmation had been made. This made the two grayish-white skeletons lying inside become bathed in the light that penetrated through the leaves, dyeing them with an orange-red color that resembled blood. These two skeletons had the shape of humans. One was less than 1.9 meters tall, while the other was less then 1.8 meters tall. It allowed one to directly feel the mixed emotions of nostalgia, sadness, pain, and guilt without realizing that they were infected and making them feel depressed.

Instead, he reined in his sigh and asked with a smile, \"Where do you think the twenty-two Beyonder pathways originate from?\"This was one of the three most important questions in mysticism, with no consensus for the answer. Every school of thought had its own theory; no one could convince anyone. The Fool Klein said simply, \"The Cosmos\" The Tarot Club had already shared the danger of the underground corruption and the cosmos. All of the members knew that these two concepts led to corruption simply from understanding it. The seven Churches believe that the Beyonder characteristic originated from the original Creator. \"He' transformed into all things, including the deities, humans, sea, land, and Beyonder characteristics,\" Leonard briefly explained. \"Of course, this is an explanation given to deacons and above. The official Beyonders below Sequence 6 don't need to know so much.\" The Life School of Thought believes that the world is split into three levels. The world of absolute rationality might be referring to the river of fate. The ancient gods then created different races. It was the Sanguine's explanation for the First Epoch, and Emlyn already had some doubts about it. He realized that the matter might be more serious than he had imagined. \"Not just just these two Lights of Lights,\" he added, \"He and the Seven had always maintained Fool, what other pathways come from the cosmos?\" Audrey habitually raised her hand and asked curiously and warily. The Fool Klein replied succinctly, \"Prisoner, Criminal, Lawyer, and Arbiter.\" The first two came from the Mother Tree of Desire, and the latter two, along with the Nation of Disorder, gave birth to order. This Outer Deity had gone silent, as though \"He\" had disappeared. The Moon pathway is as follows: Sequence 3-High Summoner; Sequence 2-Life-Giver; Sequence 1-Beauty Goddess. The Planter pathway is  Sequence 3 -Pallbearer; Sequence 4-Desolate Matriarch; Sequence 5-Naturewalker. The World Gehrman Sparrow's twitched as he spoke: \"I'll be leaving the eastern coast of Midashire soon.\" These were all done by Mr. Klein, who already expected an angel, \"Him as an angel\" He said, \"I've already grasped the names of the High-Sequence potions of the Planter and Moon pathway. I'm somewhat puzzled about two of them.\" He said he hoped that he could obtain another explanation from the Tarot Club. \"Even if you can, you won't have the chance to be a Beauty Goddess\" He mumbled inwardly, but he didn't say any words of \"comfort\" He spoke at a moderate pace regarding Merlin, the rebuilding of Constant City overnight.

The four of them couldn't help but increase their pace and quickly arrived at the gathering venue for the day. It was filled with a clear, yellow liquid and there were figures floating inside it. Some of the figures were entirely naked while others had half-naked bodies. The pool in the middle of the middle made him frown after he saw the smell of antiseptic coming into his nose. It made him shake his head and suddenly shivered. He didn't wish to stay any longer. He reached out and took two steps forward and suddenly and suddenly the door opened and he saw a pool of liquid and figures floating in it. The room was full of people who had their skin ripped off their skin and their bodies were covered in yellow liquid. They were in a soon-to-be-abandoned three-story medical school building in Backlund, in the suburbs of North Borough. The place was eerie and terrifying and Audrey was no longer as nervous and tense as before. She turned her head left and right in her surgical cap and big mask, habitually observing the environment, observing every detail of this place. She thought,I have met Mr. Fool who is close to a deity. I know the City of Silver in the Forsaken Land of the Gods, I have heard of all kinds of terrifying Glaint and the others were at a Beyonder gathering. Audrey was trying to get the Spectator potion formula. But she couldn't find the ingredients she wanted. Xio noticed that someone was following them and asked, \"What do we do now?\" Glaint didn't know what to do, so he decided to follow them. They were in a dark corridor, with no living soul in sight. A man in a white coat dragged a corpse to the side of the room. He then took out a scalpel and slit open the body's abdomen. A shrill cry came from inside the pool. Glaint nearly vomited. He wanted to turn around and run away. But when he saw Audrey, Fors, and Xio pass him, as if nothing had happened, in order to enter his room, he realized that they were pretending that they weren't his companions. He quickly caught up with them and said, \"Let the gathering begin.\" He then sat down as far as possible from the pool and waited for the gathering to begin. The gathering began at around four in the afternoon, and it was getting closer to night. The Viscount was still unable to buy the horn of an adult Flying Unicorn and the venom crystal of a Royal Jellyfish. He didn't maintain his aristocratic demeanor as he slumped against the wooden wall of the carriage and sighed. He felt as if he had taken a huge risk by joining the gathering. Audrey and the others left in secret to avoid exposing their identities. The tracker never attacked them. Klein spent two days at the Quelaag Club as if nothing had happened. He even played a game of cards with the equestrian teacher, Talim, and others, winning a few soli. He didn't forget to visit the outside of Lawyer Jurgen's house to make sure if there were no lights and to feed the cat. At eight o'clock on Friday night, he put on his iron mask and wore his black-hooded robe and entered the activity room of Old Mister Eye of Wisdom. He put on a mask and went to bed, leaving the door open for the rest of the night. The next day, he went to Sequence 8 to meet with the Psychology Alchemists, who were planning a meeting with the Count's daughter, Audrey Hall, to buy a formula for a new formula. He also went to see if he could get in contact with the other members of Sequence 8, but they were already at the meeting. He left the room at the end of the meeting and went back to his home in Empress Borough, where he stayed until the next day.

He also looked through the corner of his eye to observe Mr.Azik's reaction. He wasn't too surprised that a mysterious powerhouse would appear. It was as though she was nearby or had a mystical item like that of a Traveler. The Demoness Sect and the forces of Death had previously cooperated, so it's no wonder that a demigods knows Mr Azik. He thought it was a monster that has lived for at least fourteen hundred years!

I would like to know too!\" He then turned around to look at the man. He had messy dark-blue hair, as well as a medium stature that was not considered stout. His rich experience made him statelier. He held back his impulse and only took on the role of a silent onlooker. He asked, \"Sir, is the attempt over? Might you permit our return?\" The man replied, \"Of course, if you make a formal request, you can return this very moment.\" He then walked away, leaving the girl behind. She rolled her eyes and rolled her head back. She believed that since the man had given his word, he would definitely abide by it. She was in no hurry to leave. Zhou Mingrui sat at a long, bronze table with ten high-back chairs on either side in a symmetrical arrangement. The back of each chair dazzled and shone faintly with crimson red, drawing the outlines of weird constellations that differed from reality. Audrey and Alger sat face-to-face, sitting next to the Seat of Honor. The \"Iron Age\" referred to the current epoch, which was the Fifth Epoch that began 1349 years ago. They are still fighting against the dangers that grow in the dark, only that their numbers are much fewer as compared to before and during the early days of the Iron Age. If you want to become a Beyonder, join the Churches of either the Evernight Goddess, the Lord of Storms, or the God of Steam and Machinery. If not, you can rely on your luck to search for clandestine evil organizations. \"I don't want to lose my freedom,\" Audrey said, \"but I would also like to know the answer to what can I do to be a Beyonders\" \"Are there no other solutions?\" asked the mysterious man. \"Yes, there are,\" said Alger. \"But they are not as easy to come by as you think.\" Zhou Mingrui was taken aback when the \"mysterious man\" said, \"I have two sets of Sequence 9 Potion formulas\" Audrey asked, \"How can I get this potion's formula? What can I use to trade with you for it?\" Alger looked like he was already prepared as he said in a deep voice, \"The blood of Ghost Sharks, at least 100 milliliters of it.\" Audrey nodded her head excitedly, but subsequently asked worriedly, \"If I can get it-and I'm saying if-how do I hand it to you?\" \"I'll give you an address. I'll mail the formula to you, or tell you directly here, once I receive the blood of the Ghost Shark,\" Alger said. \"I think that both you and I can feel rest assured under the witness of the mysterious sir,\" he added. \"That's right!\" Audrey's eyes sparkled and agreed with excitement. \"The fact that you brought us here shows that you have tremendous strength unimaginable to us. Neither one of us would dare violate a promise with you as witness.\" \"Sir, please be the Witness of our trade?\" Audrey asked. \"Yes, Audrey.\" He gave the duo a faint smile.\"You can address me as...\"Upon saying this, he paused for a moment. He said amiably and calmly, \"The Fool.\"\"The Fool\" is a term used to refer to a person who has committed a crime or a crime of some kind.

Derrick looked at The Hanged Man, and then at Justice, wondering why they were so sensitive to this so-called \"attempt\" The Fool had deliberately mentioned it to show how open he was. It made it difficult for the members of the Tarot Club to imagine that the sacrificial ceremony he was about to provide had actually first been obtained from The Sun. Since the orthodox gods rarely responded to similar rituals, the word \"sacrifice\" had often been equated to evil gods and devils in the Fifth Epoch! The Hanging Man felt as if he was walking at the edge of the abyss. If he wasn't careful, he would fall in, only to be eroded and devoured. He tried to figure out the true purpose of The Fool from the process of the ritual. The Fool said, \"My idea is for you to sacrifice the Beyonder material to me through the ritual and I'll bestow them to Miss Justice. A transaction like this will be beneficial for both of you.\"Audrey was instantly dumbfounded. She felt that this exceeded the limits of her imagination. But she very quickly came to her senses and understood the advantages of this method and the true nature of a deity hidden behind this simple act! Mr. Fool is great! As expected, our Tarot club will be different from the other secret organizations! We'll use the method of deities to The Tarot Club was a product of an attempt. It can be foreseen that there would be other attempts subsequently and failure is inevitable. The only problem was if an ordinary passageway could be constructed using ordinary materials that contained spirituality or did it need to be Beyonder materials as well as a sufficient number of them. The stable passage created by the sacrificial ritual could only exist for a very short period of time, so Klein had to wait above the gray fog ahead of time. The Fool was in a predicament! He offered alluring attempts, making attempts one step at a time and planned to use himself, Justice, and The Sun to slowly break free of the restrictions. In the end, he might even descend into the real world! This was also the true reason why \"He\" had initially pulled people into this mysterious space, agreeing to the establishment of the TarOT Club! The Fool-Klein-couldn't help but sigh before chuckling. \"Once Mr Hanged Man's attempt succeeds, we'll have a bestowment ceremony!\" Audrey was entirely with Mr. Fool's abilities! She realized that the exchange of money could also be done through this method. Of course, of course, this was only if the attempt was only a success! The only thing that stumped him was the possession of a powerful adorer; therefore, there was no need for him to use his, Justice and the Sun. His adorer could make similar attempts. Klein appeared to be in a bit of a dilemma. He was hoping to find clues regarding the Secret Order and Lanevus by acquainting himself with Beyonders with different circles and resources in Backlund. If it's done through Justice, the person involved would eventually hold back... However, I'm not sure if it's possible to pull them up above the gray fog simply by reciting my name... In order to maintain his image, Klein didn't think too much and instead procrastinated on it. He said calmly, \"It will require a certain amount of examination. Miss Justice, use a clandestine method that wouldn't expose yourself to let them know of my name to garner interest in them.\" When Audrey saw that her proposal was about to be accepted, she immediately responded in excitement, \"Yes, Mr. Fool!\"After a few more exchanges, the gathering came to an end. The Sun, The Hanged Man, and Justice returned, while Klein remained in thegray fog, waiting for the sacrifice. After the sacrifice and bestowment topic was over, the Tarot Club met again to discuss the future of the club and its members. It was decided that Justice would be allowed to join the club, and the members would form a relatively tight and secretive organization. This way, even if a certain member was exposed, captured, or had their spirit channeled, it wouldn't have much of an impact on the TarOT Club."}

I sought out Beyonder ingredients of a potion recipe according to the standards of a dragon, but I ended up getting a silly bird who only knows how to read newspapers and plays. Darn it. I want to stuff another potion down its throat!'\" the owl repeated like a parrot. \"Old Man always calls himself a lucky person and a winner of fate. He should be fine...\" Danitz said to Klein. \"Will the medicine brewed from this really be effective?\" Klein didn't respond to Danitz's doubts. He directly picked up the paper bag and threw it over. Danitz subconsciously retorted, \"I trust him. Although his mouth stinks and is rather vile, he has a rather kind heart... Besides, Captain Elland believes that his medicine is sufficiently effective... As Gehrman Sparrow, I'm in charge of brewing the medicine\" Danitz was accustomed to doing similar things recently, so he didn't have any urges to resist. Klein got a similar similar similar chair to sit in while he watched the Wind of Azure Inn. He then added water and the herbs into it, then felt his head feel groggy. He said, \"You haven't drunk it?\" Danitz nodded. \"Yes.\" He was very exhausted and felt like he could fall asleep at any moment. He forced himself to consider various problems to combat the fatigue and illness. The powers of a Sequence 5 Nimblewright Master of the Seer pathway is highly effective against invisibility. He can try to help the chubby Apothecary find his teacher in the meantime, but without any information, with just a picture, I can only try my luck. Most native residents secretly believe in Sea God... This is what it means by a sea of people. They can also check if there were any travelers named Roy King, who registered on any liners in recent months. There's another method. I've placed the radio transceiver above the gray fog for some time. I should be able to contact the magic mirror, Arrodes, if I take it down. I was originally planning on asking for Helene's location, but I no longer need to find the red-haired lady anymore. I can switch to Roy King. He no longer showed any doubt towards an ApotheCary's abilities. By night time, he had fully recovered. He wore his hat and left the inn with Danitz. Under the cloak of night, they left Bayam and came to a secret harbor hidden on the other end of the jungle. They used the Soulfall Ritual to contact Vice Admiral Iceberg Edwina. After some time, the ship, that was often scrubbed clean and had a Klein stood by the side with his hands in his pocket as he watched Edwina Edwards appear at the bow. She was wearing a hunter's hat, a rider's shirt, and a black coat. She matched the image of a female pirate admiral in the minds of the Resistance. If it were me, I would add porter gold from Masin, z\u0142oty from Segar, motif gold coins from Balam Empire, etc. At that instant, he felt that he had experienced just too many things over the past half a month or so. It was an unprecedented level of exhilaration, as though it was an interesting dream. He then described in detail things he couldn't explain in the letter. Towards the end, he mentioned in passing about the matter regarding Bansy Harbor, saying how it involved King of Angels Medici and \"His\" descendants. After returning to the Wind of Azure Inn, Klein was just about to sleep when he saw the surrounding colors turn abnormally bright. The white bedsheets turned whiter, and the brown floorboards turned more brownish-yellow. The dark red curtains appeared like fresh blood. In the scene with all sorts of colors stacked upon each other, Azik Eggers suddenly walked out from a rippling aqueous void. His skin was bronze in color, and he had soft facial features. He was dressed in his usual shirt, bow tie, tailcoat and a top hat."}

The Unshadowed Crucifix was obtained by one of the three Kings of Angels, or it landed in Amon's or Adam's hands. To \"Them,\" this is an important item \"Their\" father left behind. It doesn't belong to Elvish, Dragonese, and ancient Hermes... Yes, it has similarities with the ancient Feysac of the Northern Continent and the Dutanese of the Southern Continent.

From the looks of it, was it really arranged by Adam? It's a very reasonable manner to give the cross to Miss Magician and Miss Judgment. But the level of \"He's\" plan on raising that question and obtaining an answer is extremely high. That City of Silver Creator's level is \"He was able to sense my history despite the long stretch of history between us\" He cast his gaze above the gray fog and cast it on this mysterious space.

Audrey knew that Hvin Rambis was actually a member of the upper echelons of a secret organization known as the Psychology Alchemists, but she didn't understand how this was suddenly exposed. Hvin has been identified as a cultist and is wanted by all three Churches. He disappeared before the warrant was issued. Audrey was about to solemnly pray to the Goddess when a gray fog appeared before a blurry figure that sat on the middle of the grayish-white fog, that appeared that doesn't belong to the Evernight Goddess. It nearly lurked here, hidden, but then it appeared in front of an ordinary house in Cherwood Borough. It was a postman riding a bike braked and stopped at the door. After a while, a pitch-black flame suddenly spewed out of the mailbox's mouth. The postman briskly walked to the mailbox and threw the letter in. Following that, he didn't delay as he got on his bike and kicked off. The flame burned quietly and quickly disappeared. Audrey asked with concern, \"Father, did something happen?\" The Church of Evernight has obtained intelligence from Qonas Kilgor and confirmed that King George III hides an extremely huge secret. For the obtaining of a Blood Emperor ruins in the Sterlewen segment of the Tussock River, he colluded with the Demoness Sect and Psychology Alchemists to partake in human trafficking. Audrey's eyes widened as upheavals went through her heart. She felt an inexplicable sense of anger and sadness. It felt like particular principles she had upheld in the past had been ruthlessly trampled, or that values that had stood up to time were silently crumbling. The three Churches likely don't have any actual evidence; otherwise, Father wouldn't only be frustrated to this degree... Audrey sat in the tranquil darkness and didn't move for a long time. Then, she exhaled and whispered, \"Thank you, Mr. Fool. Please convey my gratitude to Mr. World.\" After her prayer, Audrey sat on her bed and didn's move for another long time, until she was finally able to get up and walk out of the room. \"I'm aware,\" she said. \"Please remind Miss Justice to be careful when she meets Hvin Rambis again.

{"num_chp":510,"summary":"Klein used Sun Halo again, Donna and the others regained some of their courage, like people who had fallen into the water and desperately grabbed onto the last straw. They hurriedly walked on the empty streets in silence. The candlelight from the cathedral was shining through the narrow windows high above, like a beacon in a storm. They arrived outside the Storm cathedral, but the doors were shut tight. Klein raised his hand and knocked three times. A vigilant male voice immediately came from behind the door. Captain Elland asked, \"Why are you here?\" Klein calmly said, \"You helped me pay White Shark's compensation.\" After a moment of surprise and amusement, Elland made an initial confirmation that it was the real Gehrman Sparrow outside. At the very least, even a monster adept at disguising wouldn't have known something that was privy only to the two of them. He asked, based on his conclusion from the situations from before, \"The priest I knew, Jaylet is dead in there, and Bishop Millet is nowhere to be found for the other priests to be. Same for the rest of the priests.\" Klein then pointed to the prayer hall and pointed to let the others in here here here and let them step in to let them know what was going on there. The others followed him and the door was unlocked and opened. The group then entered the church and went to the main entrance, which was guarded by a guard of honor. A dead priest with a missing bishop? The whole cathedral is devoid of the living? This is a little problematic...Klein gripped the cold Azik's copper whistle, his heart sinking. Underneath this cathedral, there was definitely a Mandated Punisher team formed out of 6\u20138 Beyonders, as well as an indefinite number of Sealed Artifacts. Even High-Sequence Beyonders wouldn't be able to wipe out this force in a short span of time without causing a stir. The rest of the population had more or less understood the situation, but they had opted for silence. After all, Klein wasn't sure if his guess was right, and he could only make the safest choice. He waited nervously for any changes to befall him, as he would have returned to the White Agate to the extent that he could withstand a certain number of cannons and many accidents.After a short rest, the group left the cathedral and left the group's defense much tighter. The cathedral grounds were no longer suitable for prolonged stays, and the group decided to return to the ship first. The group left a short short time later and returned the group to the vessel. The team left the ship after a short while and returned to The White Agates to the port of Bansy Harbor, where they were waiting for a ship to arrive that would take them to the other side of the island. The ship arrived at the port shortly after 2:30pm. Klein no longer needed to toss the copper whistle to attract the monsters, so he stuffed it back into his pocket. After a few steps, Elland made a cautious suggestion. \"Shall we send a telegram to the Church of Storms's headquarters to report on Bansy Harbor?\" After walking for a while, they saw the telegraph office in sight. A faint yellow light suddenly emerged from the side street and approached them from the depths of the fog. It was a middle-aged man carrying a lantern. He wore a dark blue bishop robe embroidered with the symbol of the storm. His head was bowed and his face was pale. He was wheezing as he staggered while walking. Elland was about to step forward to support the Storm bishop when he saw Gehrman Sparrow take out a gold coin and mutter in a low voice, \"He has ill intentions.\" The gold coin flew up and then tumbled in the air before landing in Klein's palm, heads facing up. It meant a positive result! It meant that they would eventually be saved. Blazing Danitz breathed a sigh of relief, then his heart skipped a beat. He didn't wish for the bishop to pay notice to him and discover that an infamous pirate had played an important role in this matter, and by then, he would probably still be trapped on the White Agate. \"Yes, Your Excellency.

After that, the full-body mirror with cracks suddenly rippled with aqueous light and silver words quickly appeared: \"Exalted Great Master, your devoted, loyal and humble servant, Arrode, is here to answer your summoning\" After answering, he silently added in his heart: \"I'm just comforting you... After I complete the ritual, I'll personally pay Miss Sharron a visit\" After a few seconds, the pale golden words faded away, becoming silver once again. On the surface of the mirror, lines of words appeared again: \"Eight\" There are there are eight detailed records on the second Blasphemy Slate. There are no details on the first, but the second is more detailed. Unfortunately, I haven't seen it yet. I'm just short of Prisoner, Devil, and Demoness... Heh, are her magic tricks just for show?

As for the others, I've heard of some names, but it's not a complete list. There's Tenebrous World, Knowledge Moor, as well as the Brood Hive that's related to the moon\" Klein silently repeated the key information in Arrodes's response. He had a nagging feeling that he should be able to grasp something, but he didn't gain much from it. He even lacked the ability to piece together the clues. \"From the looks of it, you might come from the Chaos Sea,\" he said with a smile. \"That's not important. What's important is that I'm your loyal, lowly, and obedient servant.\" \"What are the origins of Dark Angel Sasrir?\" Klein asked. \"There was a myth that said that, when the ancient sun god was born, \u2018He' was light and darkness combined. Back then, it was theAncient sun god who personally fabricated and spread this myth... Amon's brother, your wife has become the Dark Angel!\" Klein was first alarmed before many strange ideas arose in his mind. \"The World is a fake person. He doesn't have his own spirituality and thoughts...Thankfully, The World is not a person\" \"Dark Angel\" was ultimately the deputy of the divine kingdom, god's left hand. So this implies that this was very likely I cannot eliminate the possibility that the Hidden Sage, Primordial Moon, and the Dark Side of the Universe are the Dark Angel's \"alt\"... Yes, there might still be the Mother Tree of Desire hidden within... It's also possible with Prisoner. There's no clear evidence that this pathway has produced a true deity. Back then, the Chained God might not even be a King of Angels. After some thought, he said to Arrodes, \"It's your turn to ask.\" On the cracked full-body mirror's surface, silver words twisted together and formed a new sentence: \"Great Master, may I guess what you want to ask next?\" Klein nodded slightly and answered, \"Sure.\" \"You wish to ask about Sasrir's current state. My answer is, I don't know, as I can't see.\" Behind the silver words was a smiley face with a simple drawing. On the surface of the mirror, the simple smile on his face turned into a waving cat's paw. \"That's all for today. I will summon you again in the near future at any time,\" Klein praised. \"Yes, Great Master.

The room was lit by gold-plated candle lamps on the coffee table and cupboard. The lovers of both mysticism and psychology were either descendants of professors at universities, or the children of the rich. For example, a young man was the father of the owner of the most famous department store in Backlund. The only time Audrey was fully expressing her curiosity was by asking questions, expressing her yearning and yearning for answers. The meeting ended with a discussion of the Body and Mind as well as the collective subconscious world and the collective spirit of the world as the well and the subconscious world as well. It was the first time Audrey had been in a room with a man who was not a member of the Psychology Alchemists. Her maid and bodyguard stayed behind while she walked with Susie into a spacious activity room. In the activity room, be it for the atmosphere or some other reason, the gas lamps were not lit. Before Audrey could take a good look at her surroundings, she saw a gentleman in his thirties walking towards her. He wore a gray tailcoat. He appeared very gentle and elegant, nothing like a furniture merchant but more like a university lecturer.

Little Sun has recently chanted my name, and it happened when he was interacting with a member of the exploratory team who was corrupted. He held a sacrificial ritual, and there were likely symbols corresponding to The Fool at the scene. The ancient palace above the gray fog appeared. So, the true Creator sensed the existence of the Fool and confirmed that I was the one who had been sacrilegious, no-harassing, no that's not right either-spying on him.

With Vice Admiral Iceberg Edwina being of equal rank as Vice Admiral Hurricane Qilangos, it wasn't difficult for her to guess that he had acquired Creeping Hunger. In that case, taking the initiative to divulge it gave him a psychological advantage rather than being exposed by her. He didn't directly threaten her or refuse to admit it. Instead, he provided a calm answer that hid madness within it. He suspected that it didn't originate from the dark Second Epoch, but it was something that was connected to the Giant King's Court. Even if it doesn't involve the Giant Court, I wouldn't receive any effective revelations about it. The only benefit is that it will disrupt it's plans without benefiting me. If it's located in the Forsaken Land of the Gods, then it's unlikely to find the target even if he bought it, as it's likely to be in the Blood of the Blood. It was a gigantic black iron key that nearly made Danitz lose his life in Bayam. He couldn't help but inwardly mumble,5,000 pounds?

He also saw a gold coin from the Fourth Epoch's Solomon Empire. The key was about the size of a seven-string zither zither. It was the key to the Church of the God of Wisdom and Wisdom Knowledge and Knowledge. It is the headquarters of Vice Admiral Iceberg's faction of the Resistance. It seems they're leaning towards cooperating with the organization backing me. I wonder if they will get so infuriated that they end up losing control. I plan to hunt him.

There was a rope tied around his neck, a rope that was tied in a dead knot. The floor was littered with bloody thighs, calves, boots, ribs, a heart, arms, eyeballs, and other human parts. On the wall hung a portion of pale red intestines. The background was a large patch of bright red with milky white markings. It was like a thick and sharp claw that forcefully scratched out a mark. Could it be that there's another one? Could it not be dead yet? No, no, I know what's going on...Klein suddenly came to a realization. The deceased must be the Beyonder who killed the bar's gang leader. He was finished off by the faction who had set the trap... According to Little Sun's description, I've always suspected that the faction is the Rose School of Thought because they grasp the Prisoner pathway, which is also the mutant pathway. And one type of mutant was the werewolf! The crime scene before him proves that Miss Marron is in line with the Marron School of Shar and Marron defectors of Thought...K Klein calmly retreated out of the scene, but at the same time confirmed that there weren't any Beyonder characteristics present at the time. He then solemnly drew a triangular Sacred Emblem on his chest. He took out his penny and flicked it up. Klein was walking down an alley when he saw a carriage stop in front of him. The carriage's window was opened, revealing a pale face which wore a hint of madness to it. It was Maric, Miss Sharron's companion who controlled zombies! Maric gestured for Klein to board the carriage. After he sat down, the carriage began to move slowly. Klein asked if they had any books on mysticism. Sharron looked at him and replied stoically, \"Help. We'll use your help as barter.\" \"I can trade for it with gold pounds,\" Klein replied. \"It would be best if they went in-depth. As you know, I lack such knowledge,\" Maric said. \"We do have a lot of knowledge regarding mysticism, such as Shaman King Klarman's Book of Secrets, but what can you use totrade for it?\" Klein asked. \"Shaman King? Which pathway and Sequence is that? As these thoughts flashed past his mind, Klein deliberated his tone and said, \"I Can trade for It with Gold pounds\" \"We'll use Your help as Barter,\" Sharron responded. \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. I'm just trying to help you out.\" \"Help me out?\" \"Yes, of course,\" Klein said, looking at her. \"What do you need?\" \"A book of mysticism\""}

That's way too short, isn't it? A thought flashed through Klein's mind. He put down Groselle's Travels and quickly wrote: \"I summon some ice-cream for Will Au back at Backlund, and if I head out too frequently, we might run into each other. It's a little dangerous when eating it and it'll disappear in fifteen minutes... It's just splendid.. It's no need to worry about gaining weight at all.\" \"I hope it works...

Then, he sacrificed Groselre's Travels back above the gray fog of Backlund\" \"It's a very possible problem when he has to head out to Backlund and that Amon is there, and that Backlund is there\" \"If you want to know the truth, you have to go to the real Backlund. You have to find the real Will Au and talk to him. He will tell you what the truth is, and you will find the truth.\" Klein couldn't help but mumble inwardly. He decided to change his clothes and leave the house because he had to keep his promise. Saturday morning, the sky was gray and misty. It made one feel inexplicably stifled. This was a common scene in Backlund's deep winter. Although the smog wasn't as thick and pungent like last year, the geographical environment and climate characteristics had determined that such situations would definitely exist for a long period of time. Furthermore, victory over environmental pollution was never something that could be declared in a year or two.After putting on a black coat that covered her knees, and a black veil hat, Melissa quickly walked to the door. Her brother Benson held his hat and shook his head. \"A young girl who isn't even twenty years old should be dressed like a teenager. You look overly mature and old-fashioned in that, understand? Old-fashioned.\" He then took out a silver pocket watch covered in vine-leaf patterns and snapped it open. \"Let's go. There's still a long way to go to the municipal square.\"Melissa tersely responded and went out into the streets with her brother. \"What do you think His Majesty will be talking about in his speech today?\" she asked. \"It should wait till the content is understood. Otherwise, they would be worse than a curly-haired baboon,\" Benson said with a smile. Benson asked his sister what was wrong with Mrs. Thomas. Melissa told him that she had a disease caused by anxiety. Benson looked at the back of the man and asked in puzzlement. \"Does he still need to do something else?\" he asked. Melissa didn't respond, but her expression was a little dazed. They walked forward silently, as if they were relying on inertia. They came out of their houses and from the streets they were on, like water droplets splashing upward. They merged together at the intersection, forming a tiny stream. The stream surged ahead, combining with other tributaries, and flowed into the square's entrance, interweaving into a majestic torrent. The torrents slowly surged forward, flooding the square. The people were either dressed in formal attire or holding canes, dressed up as gentlemen. Otherwise, they were dressed in blue, green, yellow, and red-colored skirts; sweaters and leather jackets matched with pants; or dark-colored petticoats. Their colors were dull. Despite this torrent of humans, Melissa felt like she was as puny as a water droplet. The handouts just happen to start after His Majesty's speech, so Mr. Thomas probably wants to go there directly. He's a decent gentleman, so he probably doesn't want others to recognize him. If one's late, there might not be any left. They'll have to go to the cathedral, the workhouse,"}

The power that descended with the help of the doll took less than two seconds to escape out of his range. The doll with curved eyes and mouth instantly lost the support that seemed to arise from having a skeleton before slumping to the table, motionless. The cloth that draped the sofa rose up, tied itself into a robe, and wrapped around the train conductor's throat. Scarlet flames surged out from his clothes, instantly blanketing his body and removing the restraints. He had been possessed by an evil spirit! The flames that soared up from before hadn't extinguished. They were burning away his clothes and flesh, only to reduce him to a pitch-black paper figurine. It was a surreal and illusory feeling.

He had lost his target just moments ago, at the instant when the crimson moon brightened. The believers in the room were praying to the Primordial Moon, paying no notice to what was happening. Klein entered the room in an unhurried pace before they turned their heads when they noticed him. They treated Gehrman Sparrow as an oracle that had descended upon them. They saw a bright moon halo at his head. He asked in a deep voice, \"Who was the saint you met previously?\" One of the believers respectfully answered, \"Oracle, it was Shaman King Klarman.\" He was alive in a time over a millennium ago. Saints of non-special pathways have no way of living that long... He joined the Rose School of Thought but still believes in the Primordial moon. Through some means, he has extended his life? Or could it be that his Sequence alone affords him a long life? Klein's mind whirred and recalled the origins of the name \"Klarman\" He asked, \"Are you the author of that Book of Secrets... Isn't he long dead?\" The believers replied, \"Yes, I am.\" He asked them out of a back robe with a mirror on them. \"What is your name?\" They said, \"Klein.\" He said, 'I am a High-Sequence Beyonder of the Wraith The Church of Storms's Mandated Punishers had taken over the case of the mysterious deaths of the steam locomotive's staff.

The believers of the Primordial Moon tried to regain their reason as they tried to resist. However, they were quickly suppressed, either dying or being injured in the process. After they lowered the corpses and carried out their investigations inside the room, they saw that these people had been piously praying to the Primordial moon in the activity room, holding a rather diabolical ritual. After squirming for quite a while, it rotted and died. The elder looked up and slowly exhaled. His bloodshot eyes were filled with puzzlement.

Klein then asked, \"Which faction could have more than the seven Churches?\" Carlson responded, \"The church of the Evernight Goddess, of course.\" Klein then said he would tell the Machinery Hivemind about the tomb, and asked for a reasonable reward. Carlson then said goodbye to the bartender, and left the room to go back to his hotel room to get some sleep. The next day, he and Moriarty went back to the hotel, where they were met by the bartender. Klein told Carlson about an aristocratic tomb from the Fourth Epoch. The tomb was found at the mouth of the Stratford River in White Cliff Town. The items on the outside can prove that they're members of the Tudor Dynasty's Amon family. Carlson and Ikanser Bernard, the Machinery Hivemind's deacon, went to the bar to talk about the tomb. Klein gave a self-deprecating laugh and said, \"My reputation has always been.\" After making the deal, he sauntered out of the Lucky Bar and left the two men alone in the bar. \"I'll give you the information now,\" Klein said. \"We will collect the relevant information first before we act.\" \"Don't tell this to anyone else, or explore it yourself, or you will only lose their lives,\" Klein warned. \"If I dared, I wouldn't be sitting here here today,\" Carlson replied. \"And if I didn't, I'd be dead by the time you got back to me,\" Klein added. \"You're not dead yet, are you?\" Carlson asked. \"No, I'm not.

Why didn't Emperor Roselle dare to mention the name of that organization, even when it's written in Chinese? This is completely different from the style of writing where he dared to write anything in his diary. What was he afraid of, or what was he worried about? Could it be that as long as he said or wrote down the name, then they would be made aware of it it no matter which language he used? Does one of their members or a Sealed Artifact they possess have such abilities? A guess popped up in Klein's mind, but there was no way to confirm it unless he was willing to take the risk. Klein quickly made his next arrangements and strode out of Lucky Bar. He took a horse carriage to the Quelaag Club, intending to spend the afternoon there.

The buildings here had raised floors, propped up by wooden pilings. There were three- or four-story buildings that had evolved from the Loen-styled terrace houses. The roads that split from each other were narrow and dirty, with many stalls on either side. They sold all kinds of headgear, earrings, and accessories made of stone. They were mostly bright red or multicolored. The scene before their eyes suddenly opened up, revealing a small municipal square. Some were kneeling around the central square, some were prostrating, and some were singing softly over the pond. The natives on the Rorsted Archipelago always believed in Sea God Kalvetua. They believed that this deity who appears in the form of a gigantic sea serpent would protect all the islands here. The Church of the Lord of Storms has been constantly fighting against the heretics.

Klein made his consciousness sink and left Sefirah Castle, allowing his mind to return to his original body. Immediately after, he began to influence Utopia. He planned to use all sorts of arrangements to temporarily make all the foreigners \"leave,\" so that if anything happened, it wouldn't affect the innocent. Klein was prepared to abandon Utopia and change locations to rebuild his marionette town. He was very sensitive to words like \"happened to,\" \"coincidence,\" \"simultaneous,\" and \"almost the same\" This was a mark left behind by his past experiences. He had trouble sleeping previously because of his anxiety and nervousness. That was why he thought of walking around the headquarters of MI9 to ease his mood. However, when he heard the conversation between his colleagues at night, it triggered an eruption in his emotions. He decided to go back to Utopia to face the problem. He took his luggage and went to the third floor of the Irises Hotel. He felt that the scenery outside was unusually familiar, but he couldn't tell what was happening too clearly. Thinking that it might have been the scene he had seen in Utopia, he covered his mouth with his hand and yawned. He covered the cover of the window and drew the curtains under the Monica slept until midnight when she suddenly needed to pee. She quickly relieved herself and ran out of the bathroom to her bed. It didn't take long for her to fall asleep again. About 15 minutes later, the patrolling Biles rubbed his hands and turned towards the street where the police station was. He was about to hand over duties with his colleagues when his body froze in the alley. The black and dense Spirit Body Threads on his body peeled off at the same time as they floated upwards. With Roselle's help, they reformed into three figures. The leader of the Secret Order, Zaratul, used the location provided by the historical projection to sneak into Utopia. The Worm of Spirit fused with the ugly doll, causing it to distort as it squirmed, growing out eyes, nose, and ears, making it look like Klein Moretti. \"He\" took out a black shroud and abruptly wrapped Klein's doll up! The doll was wet and sticky. It had no eyes, ears, or nose. It only had a pinhole-like mouth that emitted and sucked grayish-white fog. He didn't hesitate. With a thought, he returned to Sefirah Castle and thought about a button that had been pressed. He woke up suddenly, who was at the bottom of the Saint Arianna Cathedral, and knew that an accident had happened. He thought of a button he had pressed. With the level and strength of a King of Angels, he was able to resist enemies that had shown or had yet to show themselves. The moment the grayish-white fog entered his eyes, it turned into a whirlpool formed by countless transparent maggots. The vortex extended out slippery tentacles covered with strange patterns.Unlike previously, the vortex emitted a powerful suction force, causing Klein's figure to speed up and be entangled by countless tentacles. At this moment, many marionettes, who had been dead for a long time in Utopia, rapidly decayed from losing the Spirit Body Threads maintaining them. Their limbs dropped to the ground or mutated because of their Beyonder characteristics. The latter transformed into different monsters, ones far more terrifying than imaginable. After dodging Zaratul's fatal blow, Klein ran into the fog of history and fled towards the former metropolis from a time before the First Epoch. It was a safe room that could be trusted. This was because only a Scholar of Yore who was a human from before history could enter. The old metropolis was situated inside the old meeting place of Sefirah Castle.

When Klein exited the carriage at Daffodil Street, he instinctively looked at the driver, Cesare, only to see his relaxed smile, as if he hadn't noticed anything unusual that had happened. He decided to maintain his gentlemanly behavior and not attempt to scale the pipe back into his room. As for his stained clothes, he would take them to the Blackthorn Security Company tomorrow and get a professional to wash them through the police department. That would prevent his clothes from shocking his maid Bella and his sister Melissa. He then entered the room, locked the door, and removed his clothes, before he fully relaxed. He took out the letter and began reading seriously. It can be inferred that Mr. Azik has lived for over a thousand years and is most likely a High-Sequence Beyonder. He would most likely have encountered the powers of many different Beyonders in his earlier lives. In other words, it isn't only the Shepherd that gives him feelings of familiarity, but jobs such as the Unshadowed, Demon Guardian, or Hunter that would do so.

That can be Klein thought about the 300 pounds lying around in his anonymous account. He had saved up completely identical to materials that were not identical to those he saved up for. He decided to try out the sacrificial ritual he knew of. Azik warned him that he had to be very cautious when using sacrificial rituals. The worst thing that could happen is that the ritual would fail. He thought for a moment, recalling the complex symbol on the back of his chair at the ancient bronze table. It was made up of a Pupil-less Eye which represented secrecy, and the partial contorted lines which represented change. That should be my symbol, or more accurately, that is what symbolizes me in the world above the gray fog. But I cannot be too sure of that, so I'll have to try it out... Even if the symbol is wrong, as long as I get my honorary name right, the target of the sacrifice wouldn't point towards some other entity. If you can make the corresponding entity very interested in your sacrifice, then \u2018He' will open the gates to \u2018His' kingdom for you after you finish reciting the incantations. This will allow you to construct a tunnel that connects to the gates of the kingdom where the corresponding entities resides. If the entity is interested, then your sacrifice is complete. If it is not, then you will have to build a new tunnel on your own accord. After he finished reading Mr. Azik's letter, Klein rubbed his fingers together and ignited a flame of spirituality. He burned the paper to ash and threw it into the rubbish bin. The next day, Dunn Smith, who had communicated with the Mandated Punishers and Machinery Hivemind, started to assign missions. Klein was tasked to investigate a number of people who had connections to Lanevus. But because of his suggestion and the policy of the Nighthawks, he didn't have to be responsible for the people he had met previously. He continued with his combat lessons in the afternoon. He saw many contorted lines appearing on its back. His muscles, skin, and bones began undergoing a strange transformation. He transformed into the unconscious man, completely identical in height, appearance, and demeanor! He then leisurely walked in front of the dressing mirror and saw the black glove on his left hand twitch. He then wore the man's clothes and wore them for the rest of the day. He had a vague understanding of his shortcomings long ago. He was cautious and rational when it came to things he made plans for, but once the events deviated from his original plans, he would easily consider only the good and disregard the bad when he was forced to be on his toes. He didn't want to court death... Klein extended his palm to cover his face. He wanted to go through everything that he needed to take note of before putting it into practice."}

The vision then disappeared, leaving only shadows of cold, crimson, or fallen evil. The image of Emlyn was then replaced by a figure that was like a huge black whirlpool that was crazily devouring the light around it, causing his body to become distorted. It was the figure of the ancient shaman King Klar man. He was standing behind a glass window, looking at the crimson moonlight that fell onto the cathedral's bell tower. His body was distorted by the light, causing him to look like he was being devoured by a black whirpool. The light then shot out and hit Emlyn, who then turned back into a human."}

In seconds, it had entered a range which was cause for alarm for the Future. At that moment, he was somewhat hesitant to make a choice that directly matched his persona. But at this moment, Admiral Hellwell had yet to show any signs of animosity. He might have qualms about the faction backing Cattleya and the crew of the Future's ship. He used the devouring and digesting method in order to resist the monster's flesh which possessed immense vitality. Bloodless Heath Doyle protected Frank, Nina, and the other sailors. It didn't seem to be aware of what had happened. It had ghastly-pale eye whites as it looked down from above without blinking. It aimed at a spirit world creature and aimed at the eye that belonged to a spirit. Klein was about to activate Creeping Hunger and use the Baron of Corruption's Distortion power to change the target of the cannonballs, sending them further away when he saw Anderson Hood raise his right hand and push it forward. As the Black Tulip approached, the surface of the sea between the two gigantic sailboats which was dyed with golden sunlight rapidly turned black. It didn't look like ink, but the darkest night without any moon or stars. Pale corpses reached out their palms which had rotten flesh dangling from them as dark red or cold flames emerged, forming pairs of eyes. Shadows, wraiths, and all sorts of strange spirit world creatures were flying in circles, boring through the ship at times as the shipboard protruded transparent faces that weren't too obvious. Admiral Hell Ludwell didn't let his \"weak\" subordinates follow him. After all, he could control the undead and spirit world creature to steer the ship. As Klein sighed, the Black tulip ceased its bombardment and changed its speed again, closing the gap between it and the Future. The battle between the future and the black sails of the black Tulip was a battle for the future! The battle was to decide who would be the victor and who would become the leader of the future. The winner would be decided by the outcome of the battle, which would determine the fate of both the Future and the Black Sulip. The fight was to be fought in the future, which was the present. Anderson was about to press his hands onto the shipboard to create scarlet flames that spread outwards to prevent the invasion of the undead army. He was surprised to see Gehrman Sparrow turn around and fly back into his cabin. A charm suddenly fell in front of him as he heard a word spoken in ancient Hermes. The eyes behind the silver mask burned silently with two pale-white flames. The shadows, wraiths, and the spirit world creatures of the Death domain who were spiraling above the Black Tulip immediately swarmed towards the enemy. They either opened their mouths, letting out silence screeches, or they extended their long tongues with shrunken faces as though they were extremely excited. The bow was left completely empty except for Admiral Hell Ludwell, who immediately turned his body to fly to the stern of the Black tulip. His body was bent slightly as he released the right hand on his cap, his gaze locked on the silver-masked Admiral Hell. The strange-looking spirit-world creatures followed closely behind. He landed on the deck while pressing down on the cap, landing right before Ludwell. He then reached into his pocket with his left hand, releasing the wall of spirituality on a squarish box. Then, he took out Azik's copper whistle, which was tied to a few matchsticks, and threw them at the deck of the\u00a0Black Tulip's stern.

He didn't notice anything amiss even when Maysanchez's men left the region and vanished into the darkness. Klein made Enzo, who had turned into a mixed-blood lad, open the suitcase in his hand. He took out the gold coins and bars one by one and did the count. It was valued at a total of 30,000 Loen gold pounds. Klein was taken aback as he asked with a straightened back, \"What?\" Reinette Tinekerr's four blonde, red-eyed heads nodded seriously and said, \"Mission...\" \"Price...\" \"Depends On...\" \"Your...\" \"Ability...\" \"To...\" \"Earn Money...\" \"Missions will...\" \"Cost more...\" \"I never expected that... Klein turned agape, but he was unable to retort. After all, such matters were solely decided by the helper. With him advancing to Sequence 4 and becoming a demigod, the missions that he needed her help with in the future was likely to increase in difficulty and danger. With the matter coming to a close, he was poised to return to Backlund. But then he suddenly sighed silently and looked at the horizon. Backlund was Northlund University of Technology, Backlund... Backlund, in the Loen Kingdom. He was touring the campus with a few members of the Bursary Foundation. Backlund University of Technology had recently sent out its acceptance letters, and it was matriculation day for the new class of students. Audrey and the Loen Charity Bursary Foundation's staff came to help the first batch of approved applicants. The students on campus wore a beaming expression, and every action they made exuded obvious confidence. Their words and actions had an indescribable vigor, one that seemed to have immense hope for the future that allowed them to see light. The feeling was completely different from the few public primary schools that Audrey had experienced in the past. They were either boorish and noisy or silent and gloomy. A common trait of theirs was being uneasy and confused. Whenever they encountered strangers of status, they would be filled with trepidation. Their eyes were dull, lacking the spirit that youths ought to have. A mixed-blood, seven- or eight-year-old girl who looked like a doll, held her mother's hand as she waited in a long line. A gentleman with white sideburns and a top hat holding a gold-inlaid cane. He had a servant with brown skin as he walked towards first-class. The servant looked around curiously and said, \"Sir, the recent situation is different from what I had imagined. I thought the people from Balam would lead tough and difficult lives, with squalid, chaotic, poor, and repressed surroundings. But there was none of them even drank The girl and her parents boarded the steam locomotive and found their seats. A man with dark brown skin, soft facial features, and red lumps on his cheek walked over with his head bowed. He quickly entered the operator's compartment and said to the train driver, \"All the train attendants have been swapped with our men. The bridge ahead is where the sacrifice will be held\" The girl retracted her gaze and skipped along as she left the platform with her parents. She saw figures standing outside the door, discussing something. Among them was the train conductor, as well as the man with the lumps in his cheek. A second later, these people turned their heads over and curled the corners of their lips, revealing eight teeth. They nodded gently, looked away, and continued on their way. After a long trip, it finally arrived at its destination, the pier. The girl was somewhat sleepy and was no longer as lively as before. She followed her parents' lead, and inched towards the door. There were a few attendants at the door who were helping some of the passengers remove their luggage. These attendants curled their lips and revealed eight teeth, showcasing a warm smile. The train driver nodded and said, \"May God be satisfied with the sacrificial items on this train\" \"Let's hope we can gain eternal life in the kingdom.\" \"Whoosh! The train has arrived at the pier!\" the girl exclaimed. \"It's time to go!\""}
{"num_chp":1023,"summary":"His Majesty... Xio was a little confused and filled with confusion when she heard Viscount Stratford's reply. She found it inexplicable that Shermane would deliberately approach this captain of the royal guards just to investigate where his loyalties lay. Fors didn't listen to the Telepathy at such a superficial layer. She took out the pure crystal ball and placed it in Xio's pocket. She then warily stored it away in a bag that contained all kinds of ritual materials. Fors no longer felt as anxious as before. She had used up all five stones that allowed her to use Teleport. Although she believed that the \"full moon ravings\" would become clearer and more terrifying with the usage of each stone, she also knew that with Mr. Fool's help, this wasn't a problem. Xio Derecha continued asking rather simple and unimportant questions. She asked, \"Do you know Mason Dere?\" \"Yes,\" ViscOUNT Stratford answered blankly. \"Who is he?\" Xio asked. \"He's the former captain ofthe royal guards,\" he answered simply without elaborating. \"I hope that the curse will be lifted one day... After retracting her gaze from the dull silver bracelet, Fors couldn't help but sigh. \"No matter what \"His\" real goal is, \"He\" has rescued me time and time again. It hasn't only been from the \" full moon Ravings,\" she said. Fors realized today how important and terrifying Beyonder powers at the demigod level were. If Leymano's Travels didn't have Hurricane recorded, she and Xio might not have been able to capture Viscount Stratford. The level of his strength was clear, so this immediately allowed Fors to benchmark her \"level\" in the world of Beyonders. Although their victory mainly stemmed from a sneak attack, a successful one was also a manifestation of one's strength. She realized that she had become rather formidable! Back when they were dealing with the ancient wraith, she had already come to a similar conclusion. Together with Xio's Psychic Piercing and the effects of Wintry Blade, in a head-on battle, it's reasonable for ViscOUNT Stratford to be defeated if he doesn't have any special mystical items. She was also in a dilemma, feeling pangs of excitement and fear at the same time. In these nearly 3,000 days, she was constantly searching for an answer, but she was also afraid that the answer wasn't something she expected. She asked in a pressing tone, \"What secret?\" Xio fell into a daze for a few seconds before finally confirming the answer she received. He discovered His Majesty's secret and tried informing the three Churches but failed. He was executed on the spot. Fors, who was beside her, was also shocked to the point of being dumbfounded. She immediately crouched down and grabbed Shermane's corpse and Xio's calf. Their figures swiftly turned transparent as they vanished from the spot, Teleporting to the southern area of the bridge. Klein didn't know what the two Tarot Club members were up to, but since it involved Viscount Stratford, he definitely didn't write off its importance. He directly observed what subsequently happened to Miss Magician and Miss Judgment through the crimson stars. Since he knew the underlying truth, he knew very well what the true meaning and importance of \"who he was loyal to\" was. He suspected that the greatest culprit behind the Great Smog of Backlund was the Loen Kingdom's king, George III! He already had a guess. He knew that Demoness Trissy was targeting him, so he had remembered his appearance and characteristics at a ball. This was similar to specially marking out believers, but Klein had always held great restraint towards that and had never attempted it. He didn't need the Tarot club members to pray to directly observe their vicinity via the crimson star. After advancing to a demigod and obtaining even more authorities, he didn\u2019t need theTarot Club member to pray. He could directly observe the vicinity of their vicinity. He had never done it before, but he knew that there was something wrong with him. Although he hadn't investigated him personally, he had known that he was in trouble."}

He could only bury the idea of modifying the ritual process deep in his heart and avoid the parts which conflicted with his own wishes as much as possible. It was as if he could see the so-called \"primitive totem,\" that outsiders claimed it to be, evolving into a true god. Kalat raised his head, spread his hands sincerely, and placed them against his mouth. The blurry figure in front of him disappeared, the magnificent voice by his ears vanished, and the scene in the cave returned to its original state. The reason why the deity figurine shattered and bled is because God has changed \u2018His' image. We must build a new one! Just like the scenes we saw earlier. Above the symbol of the waves, there was a scepter in the shape of lightning, surrounded by strong winds. The Sea God Spter could provide a certain amount of strength to help the worshiper complete the ritual and achieve their goals. However, it could only be concentrated within his domain and could not exceed the limit. For example, the Evernight Goddess could use a method of influencing fate to let the believers obtain the money they needed to let \"Her\" obtain the \"Herself\" \"We will usher in a new world!\" Alger was summoned to the Cathedral of Waves by the diocese bishop, Chogo. The portrait depicted an unusually blurry and mysterious person, with no characteristics that could be used to aid in a search. As long as the prayer doesn't have any mistakes, and it is accurately pointed towards the Sea God Scepter, regardless of how perfunctory the ritual is, they will be able to receive a response. If it were placed here for a few years, decades, or even longer where it holds Beyonder characteristics and mystical items, perhaps it could really evolve into a \"sealing case\" whose effects would gradually fade one day... The entire City of Generosity, Bayam, remained asleep in its dreams. The clouds in the sky had disappeared, and the moon was scattering its crimson tranquility. Kalvetua perished completely. With that happening, the Church and the military would search for its remains. The only criteria is that I'm in a good mood... I'll think of a solution when I'm free. He fiddled with the crushed golden wine cup again, confirming that there was nothing wrong with it. After doing all this, he entered the real world and summoned himself once more to bring the Sun Brooch and other items back to his room in the inn. It was still within a comprehensible and acceptable range of normal humans. However, it was impossible to tell if the figure in the portrait was male or female, or what they looked like. Symeem Island is the clue? This person took away the most important item ahead of them? Who is this person?Alger's heart skipped a beat, and he almost didn't dare meet Chogo's eyes. He controlled his emotions and asked, \"What did he do?\" \"You don't need to know. Just pay attention to any abnormalities from people from Intis or Feysac in Bayam,\" Chogo said. \"Find the people who previously posted the notice on the front door of the cathedral. They might know something, and they could quickly give you further information,\" George ordered in a deep voice. \"My Sequence 9 is called Hunter.

Besides, I'm already at Sequence 7,\" said Danitz. \"Sequence 9 Hunter? I've killed one, and I know the corresponding Sequence 6's name is Conspiracist,\" said Klein. \"Do you think I'm not good at provoking?\" Danitz asked in passing. \"No,\" said Gehrman Sparrow. \"I'm an expert in this field!\" Danitz said, \"My ability at recovering isn't too bad.

He wished to use the effect of pressure to make Dwayne Dan\u00e8s not appear that calm or have any thoughts of resorting to sophistry. He felt ashamed as he showed some anger.

The MI9 deputy director, Qonas Kilgor, had lost 20 pounds to Admiral Amyrius. The next round will be interesting... Hehe...Klein jolted to attention as the new round began. He didn't check his hole cards when the croupier handed him two new ones.

It has a stain that is almost impossible to remove. It can only be used in operations that three or more people are above the grade of \"Security Class 3\" The puppet was discovered in Tingen, the police station in Tagen, in the year 1300.

He made the glove on his left hand transparent as he disappeared from where he was and appeared outside the guards' residence with the huge black iron key. He didn't know if the other divine kingdoms would isolate the fog of history, but at least without the GiantKing's Court having its owner present, no one would be able to stop his attempts. It was the \"home\" that he had the deepest impression and was most fond of. It could be imagined that during that period of time in ancient times,Groselle and the other rational Giant Guardians from future generations would rest, rabble, gossip, and think of fun games to play. They would live every day of their lives happily... With the shaking of Klein's hands, the ashes scattered on the wall, the ground, the bedside, the tables, chairs, and stone pillars. When the last speck of ashes was scattered, the orange light of dusk suddenly shone, making everything look peaceful.

He passed through the hall where the fateful plot was made with relatively little difficulty, and he arrived at the residence of the Giant King. There, he saw a row of huge stone columns on the left that formed railings. Beyond the railings was an orange-red gas and a churning dark blue sea. The dusk's glow seemed to be corporeal as it covered the palace's surface, bringing with it a strong sense of decadence, as though the curtains had drawn on everything in the world.

To the left of the door, there was a pitch-black hole that was the size of an adult's fist at the height of three to four meters. The gap between the door and the hole widened when Enuni's eyes suddenly reflected a turbulent pitch- black, viscous, and illusory sea. Warning bells sounded in Klein's mind. Without any hesitation, his consciousness returned to his body as he severed the connection with his Historical Void projection. He felt himself be rejected by Sefirah Castle as though it had accepted an order from someone else to stop him from entering. He suspected that the \"seawater\" that surged out from the Giant King's palace had not only \"drowned\" his marionette and historical projection, but it had also used the latter to slice off his own shadow, causing his spirit to lose its completeness. He was unable to completely suppress his inclination towards losing control. This resulted in a situation in which both parties were unable to head above the gray fog.

A wanted man was here trying to buy materials and was recognized. And this was what resulted from it. Oh Lord, what did he do, and how dangerous was he to receive such treatment? My legs went limp seeing all those firearms, limper than after spending an entire night with Ginger Sunny!\" He did not know the identity of the wanted man, much less know that the people who came to buy material had Beyonders mixed in. The brawny man obviously knew Old Neil and smiled wryly. \"I think it was Tris or something?\" he said uncertainly. The two men walked into the middle of a boxing ring. Two half-naked men were in a brawl and were shouting and cheering on the side of Klein was in a lecture hall from his previous life. He saw vendors had set up roadside stalls with bottles and cans all over. Passers-by strolled through them, either scrutinizing their goods, chatting, or comparing prices. Old Neil and Klein passed through a secret door behind them. After passing through a few rooms, the sight before Klein's eyes opened up. It was a place that was about the size of a lecture room from his former life. The sight before him was a bar with a man who wanted to drink himself to his death. The man was Ademisaul, an orphan, nicknamed \u2018monster.' He was born with high spiritual perception, and he has always been able to see things that he shouldn't, hear voices that he should not. He was the starting point of half a Sequence 9 suits that suits him is called \u2018Monster.' His nickname came from there there there was a Sequence 7 suit that was called 'Monster Suit' The man's spiritual perception is very high... or perhaps, distorted?\" Klein creased his eyebrows and muttered. \"He could tell that my body was once dead?\" Old Neil asked, \"Haven't the Navenated ever thought of taking him in?\" \"No, we don't have the potion,\" Klein said with a sigh. \"Right, he was born there there with the beginning point of a Sequence?\" \"Yes,\" Old Neil said, \"I think so.\" Klein saw Ademisaul struggle to get up and then wander off to another corner. Old Neil tried to keep the conversation between him and Klein from the people around them to avoid leaking information to mysticism aficionados. The secret organization appeared in the beginning of the current epoch. Its actual origins were unknown, but it was mainly passed down via master and disciple. Their theories and beliefs were hardly known. Klein only knew that they separated the world into three layers: the definite rational world, the absolute truth world, and the spirits' world. Wasn't that a Sequence pathway that corresponded to Seer? Confusing, really confusing...Klein shook his head and followed behind Old Neil. They walked past one stall after another. There were plants like moon flower, fingered citron, night vanilla, and mineral resources like silver, topaz, ruby and so on. He came before a stall which sold self-made amulets. He took a careful look at it for a while. He suddenly heard someone asking the stall behind him, \"Is this powder ground from cow teeth paeonol?\"Cow teeth pAEonol? Isn't that one of the supplementary ingredients of the Spectator potion?Klein thought, then turned around to look at the inquirer. He had been left with a remarkably clear impression of the ingredients. Justice had repeated the formula for the potion several times, so Klein was left with an impression of its ingredients."}

After exchanging a few whispered words with Fors, she beckoned for Mr. A's attendant. She wrote a note saying that she was purchasing the Sheriff's recipe. After checking the authenticity of the notes and the total sum, the seller finally released the potion formula he held. Xio immediately took one step forward and grabbed the note. Her eyes swept straight to the main ingredients as they were of great importance. She hasn't encountered any of the subsequent recipes for Apprentice all this time. Having fulfilled her wish, she slowly began to worry about the unknown honorary name and the evil spirit that might be haunting her. The Arbiter pathway belonged to the royal family and the military. All aspects were strictly controlled, and the leaked ones came from a small number of destitute nobles. There were hardly any complete formulas for the low to mid Sequences. Often, only one or two of them were complete and compounded with the knowledge that the main Ingredients were controlled and difficult to obtain. The seller in the study was dressed in the same way, so they couldn't see each other's faces clearly. He looked at the two people who were wearing loose robes that concealed their genders. He said, \"Let me introduce myself first, so that you won't doubt my ability\" Xio sighed and walked out of the study and took off her A man in a white mask claimed to be a believer of the Sun. He used a dualistic ritual method to light up two candles. Xio and Fors saw bright light burst out from the Sun's emblem, bursting in a pure and warm manner. It was like soaking in a hot spring, or having gone sunbathing. Klein was sitting on a low bench with a group of thieves and drunkards. He looked at the thief on the left who was handcuffed to the pipe, then at the drunkard on the right who could vomit at any moment but kept yelling about hitting people. He sighed at his present predicament and wasn't sure when he would be free from this situation. He hoped the police will have their attention on the ambassador and the Zmanger gang, and ignore my origins as a puny detective. As long as Mrs. Sammer, Mr. Jurgen, and the others don't say anything of interest to the police... Yes, they have only just met me so it's impossible for them to know too much...Meursault's Beyonder characteristic was taken away by me and was hidden above the gray fog. He didn't leave behind anything strange, so no one would able to discover that he used to be an Beyonder and have questions about my strength... Hmm... More than an hour has passed since I passed his self-encouragement test. In that time, I've learned a lot. There were chairs on both sides of the table. Klein identified the interrogator as a man who wore a black shirt, a rather uncommon sight. The man pointed the chair opposite him and said in a deep voice, \"I ask, you answer.\" Before he finished his sentence, Klein felt an unimaginable suppressive force on him. He felt that an electric current was tearing through his mind that lashed at his soul with a barbed whip. This is the result of Beyonder powers...Ordinary people might've thought of it as a psychological problem caused by nervousness. But Klein had clearly identified that this was a result of Aboveer powers, powers that could directly attack the mind of others! He quickly recalled the information he had seen before and quickly confirmed the target of his suspicion. After a moment of identification, he pushed a photo in the direction of the interrogators. It was a middle-aged gentleman who wore ostentatious clothing and looked rather charming. He once again asked, \"Were your previous statements the truth?\"Klein felt like he was being forced into a dream. He kept his mind clear and rational, and he didn't yield to the \"whip\" in his mind as he sincerely replied, \"Nothing but the truth\" The interrogator finally nodded his head. Klein immediately felt the enormous pressure disappear along with the \"Whip\" In his mind, he knew that the danger had secretly been removed."}

He silently recited his target's name, stood up, picked up his cane and his heavy portable camera, and crossed the road. He didn't run into Doragu in order to steal his belongings and use the dowsing method to easily track him. With the help of a Clown, he had secretly slipped into a spare button of Doragu's double-breasted coat and stopped in time to see him board a rental carriage. He waited patiently for a few minutes before slowly getting into another horse and said, \"Just go to my carriage driver, according to my instructions\" The carriage took him to the end of the street, where he met his target, who was wearing a black top hat, a double- breasted tweed coat, and a standard bow tie. He was slightly fat, with yellowish temples, slightly brownish eyes,. and a slightly long face. Doragu Gale would leave the office on Wednesday and Friday mornings alone and only return in the afternoon. He would leave work early for two days a week, and Mary had never seen her husband return home before seven. Mary Gale was the first manager of Coim Company and was Luke Sammer's superior; however, their shares in the Coim company Detective Klein used the Dowsing Rod Seeking method to find Doragu Gale. The easiest and most convenient items to find were those that belonged to himself. He found a hotel near the Quelaag Club and got a short-stay room for four hours. Then, he conjured a yellowish-brown goatskin and a fountain pen in front of him. He wrote the exact same divination sentence as before: \"The whereabouts of the spare button of my clothes.\" In the gray dreamy world, Klein was the first to see Doragu's black coat, which was hung on a coat rack. He also saw a romping man and woman who looked rather young. The fact that Doragu has a mistress is confirmed... How do I get material evidence? By responding to my prayers? But this is limited to what I can obtain with my own body. I can only do it through sketching and not through the camera... I can't possibly draw a picture with my bare hands, can I? It looks like today won't do. I'll tail that girl and find out her address and name later. I refuse to believe that they'll be inside the quelaag club every time they meet... It would've been the same if he was above the gray fog, but he didn't have the capacity to bother with such a question. He decided to take the opportunity to divine if the iron-black threadworm which had infiltrated his room was under control Klein didn't expect to obtain such an answer. According to his Seer instincts, such a divination was likely to fail. He wanted to directly divine the controller using dream divination. This time, Klein saw nothing in his dream, and couldn't get the corresponding revelation about the Seer pathway Beyonder. Despite thinking about it, he couldn't find any other evidence. He could only temporarily put this matter on hold and prepare for his return to the real world. Meanwhile, in Viscount Glaint's study, Audrey asked Xio and Fors for help with a mission. \"Assassinate the Intis ambassador to the Loen Kingdom, Bakerland Jean Madan.\" Xio's eyes lit up as if she could smell the ink on the bills. Audrey gave her a polite smile and said, \"I need your help with the mission.\" XIO and Fors agreed to help her out, and they left the study together. The mission was to get the Sequence 7 and even the Sequence 6 potion formula for the potion of the same name, which was the same as the Sequence 5 potion. It was the first time the two had been together since they were children, and it was the only time they had been in contact with each other. The two had never met before, and had never been in the same place at the same time. They also had never spoken to each other before. They had never seen each other in person."}

He decided to accept the offer and visit the company tomorrow. He then hid himself in the alley of the Backlund Bridge area, observing the poor that sauntered back and forth. Just a short time was enough for him to discover that the dirty and ragged clothes he had bought in the afternoon was too clean and easily attracting the attention of others. He returned to the dark alley, reached out his fingers and reached out for a new new new outfit. He was wearing a grayish-blue worker's attire, wore a cap, and hid himself from the other poor. He didn't have any money, but he had experience in disguising his eyes and brains in such a way that he could easily blend in with them. He also had experience with disguising himself in a dirty and dirty attire, compared to the dirty, ragged and clean, easily attracting attention of other people in the Alley.

The streets were narrow, with the buildings on both sides leaning close to each other. Even in the day, it appeared dark, but to the Sanguine, such an environment wasn't bad. The only problem was the dirt and messiness. After spraying a medicine that eliminated his scent, Emlyn walked into the condominium at Unit 6, went to the third story, and approached the public washroom with his nose pinched before standing outside the room of Primordial Moon believer, Argos. His sense of smell told him that there wasn't anyone inside, nor were there any corpses. But then, he caught the scent of another person. It was very identical to Argos's apartment at Limestone Street. There are two people in the room! Argos isn't home because he came to Galis Kevin... Two...Emlyn's expression suddenly froze. He was still a little fearful with Leymano's Travels. After all, the two of them were artificial vampires with rather significant strength. He never expected his hunt to be so unsuccessful. But he was delighted to discover that someone was home. It took him a great bit of effort to focus his gaze on the room. He nearly fainted from the stench wafting over from the washroom.

Susie could read the joy and sincere attitude deep inside Audrey's heart as she subconsciously opened her mouth, hoping to stir the air to produce a voice. The alert Suzie abandoned her original thoughts. She returned to the state of being an ordinary dog as she slowly wagging her tail. Audrey was taken aback before a brief silence ensued. Audrey had already finished digesting the Psychiatrist potion on Wednesday. She could easily pay off the 2,000 pounds she owed Mr. Fool's Blessed, and she could also pay the 1,800 pounds she owes Mr. World for the Psychiatist characteristic. The psychiatrist characteristic is a type of magic that can only be found in the realm of mysticism and ritualistic magic. The Psychiatrist characteristic is also known as the \"Psycho\" characteristic and is used by some of the world's most famous healers.

He was almost identical to the one in her memories. Daisy woke up from her depression and sorrow. The person who had entered Daisy's dream was none other than Leonard Mitchell. He recalled what he had seen in the dream as he wore his red glove and entered the basement of Saint Samuel Cathedral. Leonard smiled as he received the dossier. He stood there without being in a hurry to sit down as he casually browsed it. A vampire. Currently under the jurisdiction of the Church of Earth... His parents had hired private detectives to find him. Thanks to a particular detective, this matter was ultimately resolved by the famous detective, Sherlock Moriarty. Leonard's smile gradually froze as his expression turned serious. He repeated this name in his mind...Sherlock Moriarty...Klein wasn't a rush in a rush to find a true acting opportunity to engage in an opportunity to act in a way that would help the people of the Harvest Church. The Nighthawk shrugged and said, \"No, as long as you stop making me have nightmares.\" He then left the building and went back to his office. The team captain, Soest, saw a partner approach and hand him two thin sheets of paper. The information regarding the red-eyed man from the Harvest church is all here. He toured Oravi Island's port city with the mindset of a tourist, finding a brief and rare moment of relaxation in his tense life. The city had mostly immigrants from Loen. The cuisine wasn't much different from the east coast of the kingdom, with the only difference being that there were rare fruits and all sorts of seafood here. After chewing a juicy and sweet fruit, Klein watched the sky turn dark. He took a turn at the corner of the street and entered a bar named Sweet Lemon. Klein planned on buying the two remaining supplementary ingredients of a Nimblewright Master-the relatively common drago tree bark and Sonia Golden Spring water. A green-eyed man in his thirties held half a glass of liquor and spoke to two men and two women in the corner. It was a mystery if they were merchants or adventurers. The man cut off the man's words by saying, \"You are also named Gehrman Sparrow? Treasure map Why does it sound like a scam... My killing of Wormtongue has already reached this place from Bayam? Yes, it was likely communicated via a telegram or visitors. Therefore, many people know of my name and deeds but do not know what I look like...

The latter was prepared for him to seek out any abnormalities when exploring the dreams of the living entities in the book world. He then poured a few drops of blood and smeared it over the cover of Groselle's Travels. After a brief wait, his vision turned clear, and he saw blue skies, white clouds, grayish-brown city walls, and passersby. He also saw a giant with four long limbs, and his head had a huge and heavy sledgehammer hand. It was written in a language that was completely different from any of the outside world's languages. Klein instantly understood what it meant: \"Pessote Blacksmith Guild's\" He then walked out of the guild and into the Age of Steam, which hasn't entered the age of Steam yet. He felt that public hygiene was slightly better than Backlund a few years ago. It appeared to have a mature sewage system, preventing the situation of any waste and trash being dumped. It only had two stories, and the top of the door was about four meters tall. The giant's skin was grayish blue, and its head had the trademark vertical eye was a huge, heavy and vertical eye with a vertical vertical eye. It also had a single vertical eye for a head. Klein walked across the street with his lips curled. The humans walking past him didn't show any fear, as though it was a common sight. They even greeted the giant. He was just about to chase after them when he discovered that the giant had turned into another street, vanishing from his sights. He turned and entered a bar by the side of the street. He saw a man wearing a black pointed hat and an asymmetrical coat. He looked pretty handsome with his flaxen-colored hair, deep brown eyes, a high nose, and thin lips. The man was none other than the Solomon Empire viscount, Mobet Zoroast! Upon seeing him, Klein recalled the scene of the Dream Stealer's rapid aging before he collapsed onto the ground as he struggled to crawl towards Elvish Songster Siatas and grabbed her hand. He discovered that there were no signs of bruises and swelling on his face. This meant that the Elvist Songster knew that men needed to put on appearances. \"I'm as afraid of her now as I was when I first saw her,\" Klein said. \"She would beat me up. When she's happy, she beats me up! Same when she's embarrassed or angry!\" \"From this very moment, I've decided not to return home again!\" Mobet jumped up and ran to the door. As he ran, he muttered, \"I know you don't have any patience!\" You always jump to two after counting to eight!\" Klein turned his body and saw Siatas's figure, but he no longer had the intention of communicating with her. He wasn't in a rush to explore the spirit world. He exited it and began window shopping through Pessote and chatted with others. Before long, he found Groselle's residence. He was taking an afternoon nap on a huge bed on the second story. The palace was huge and opulent, and it didn't seem suitable for humans. It gave him the impression like it was from a myth as the light of dusk that scattered above it seemed frozen. It was the Giant King's Court that had appeared in the dream world of the battlefield of the gods! He was situated behind the king's court! However, this angle was completely different from before. The seven lights don't exist here... The number of spirit world creatures here are lacking... This place is indeed a fake spirit world created by the book...Klein took a step forward and found the colors in his vision saturate to the extreme as it overlapped with the obvious differences. He took out the Nightmare Beyonder characteristic from his Spirit Body. With some difficulty, he used some of its powers that it came naturally equipped with.

With his upheaval in emotions, he immediately felt the Primordial One's mental imprint strengthen, and more of it had eroded what the anchors had fixed in place. The extraordinary power and the curse that can never be broken are always two sides of the same coin... Klein sighed. Forcefully suppressing a problem that wasn't at his level, he asked, \"Do you know the potion formula for Attendant of Mysteries?\" The amethyst-wielding Saint Germain replied, \"There's a corresponding mystery attached to such knowledge. It's not in the spirit world, but according to our observations, the Attendants of Mysteries ritual should be closely related to thespirit world\" The Seven Lights immediately fell silent. \"They\" looked at each other and didn't reply for a while.

It's best if it's already restrained and one that's not too dangerous\" A beast-type Beyonder Creature? Klein was slightly moved by the thought. He remembered what the ApotheCary had said in the circus theater and that he was apparently able to read the thoughts of beasts. He was stunned for a few seconds, \"How extravagant and finding the Beyonder ingredients for me is difficult enough for me?\" He felt as if he had revealed some important secret. \"You might as well tame it and direct it to be your helper, increasing your strength severalfold...\" He immediately sneered. \"What a foolish thought!\" he said. \"Who would keep a Beyonding creature by their side? Wouldn't it be easier and more concealed to kill them to obtain its Beyonder ingredient?\" He sneered again and said, \"I've brought quite a few bottles of medicine. All of you know the effects.

Twenty of them are engraved with the sun domain's labels and symbols, forming a complete charm. They can be used to purify ghost-related monsters. There are another twenty bullets which are meant for corrupted creatures. The other ten are bullets that counter evil-type monsters, known as exorcism bullets. Their effects can be maintained for eighteen months or more. They did make related bullets according to my suggestions from last time. From the looks of it, they're more complicated than ordinary Beyonder weapons. It took them so long only to make a set. It's a good thing that I got the Dark Emperor card. Otherwise, if I met someone who can raise the price so ruthlessly, I definitely would've lost a lot of money today...Klein rolled up his robe, took out the Barbarian formula which he had long written from his inner pocket, and opened it to take a look. \"Sequence 8 Barbarian.

Supplementary ingredients: One deep-grained Walnut, one Fragrance Hornet Grass, 10 ml of the extract obtained from soaking poplar bark, The body of the gun was a deeper brass color, and the handle was made out of walnut wood. Since his underarm holster had also been lost back when he encountered the police inspection, Klein had to attach the revolver to his waist and cover it with his clothes. The woman who had bought the Barbarian formula couldn't control herself and almost said in her original voice, \"I don't have anything you need, but I can pay you in cash. Eight hundred pounds!\" Klein swallowed the word \"deal\" that he nearly said. He thought for a moment before chuckling. \"I'm only accepting bartering for the time being. You can seek out the relevant items in advance.\" The lady ruminated over the word and nodded slowly. \"Alright.\"After that, no one else said anything, and Klein's needs were also not met. He had an alternative plan. He clearly remembered that Miss Xio had once sought out a Beyonder believer of the Eternal Blazing Sun for purification. Without using divination, he tried hard to recall where. In Backlund, in the Loen Kingdom, the worshipers of theternal Blazing Sun could be considered heretics, so few of such items circulated beyond official channels. The lady who craved the Briber formula would definitely be actively looking for his desired items. It was one of the main ingredients for the Demoness of Pleasure!

He did not know if he was going to see her again, or if she had been killed by a Beyonder.

As long as you help him complete a mission, you'll be able to get the Apothecary formula. That's one of the few cathedrals of the Church of Mother Earth in the kingdom. This Church also grasps two Beyonder pathways: \"Planter\" and \"Apothecary\"... The clues match well...Klein thought as he refolded the note. There were no signs of her, leaving Klein disappointed. Now that he had 509 pounds in hand, he wanted to equip himself nicely for a mission. He went to East Borough and changed his clothes, heading to the border between North Borough and Hillston Borough. It was where the suspected member of the Numinous Episcopate, Kapusky Reid, lived. He wanted to find out why he was imprisoned in a place where the sun never shines. He also wanted to learn more about the \"acting method\" of Beyonders. Without the spread of the \" acting method,\" wild Beyonders are ticking time bombs... But if the situation would become even more chaotic and bloody... After all, there are the Laws of Beyonder Characteristics Indestructibility and Conservation... After the gathering came to an end, the gathering ended and Klein returned to Minsk Street. He didn't return to East borough directly. Instead, he went to the Border between North borough and HillSTON Borough. He was there for a few days before he returned to North Borough."}

Emlyn's face was much paler than before, and his body was much thinner. He exuded a feeling that a gust of wind would lift him up at any moment.

Klein was trying to prevent the Miracle Invoker, or Attendant of Mysteries, or the corresponding Sealed Artifact from hiding in the Historical Void and ambushing the Beyonders of the ancient Nois City. The ambush that Zaratul had laid for him still left Klein feeling a lingering sense of fear. He didn't wish to directly encounter a cluster of translucent maggots that twisted into a huge vortex when he leaped into the fog of history, nor did he wish to be pursued by those terrifying tentacles. He could only stay there for another fifteen minutes at most, and that was only if he didn't make any burdening attempts at summoning Historical Void projections. He stretched out his hand, grabbed, and pulled out his former self. This former self was also wearing a silk half top hat, a black trench coat, and holding a simple glass lantern. With the lantern in hand, Klein walked through the streets that were littered with corpses. Back then, the city was in a similar situation... Although I'm also a Seer, I have to say that, in terms of horror, terror, and bizarizess, our pathway is definitely ranked amongst the top three... Could it be that I'll be acting in the same manner in the future in the manner in which I did in the past? I don't know, but I'll try to think of something to do with it, if I can. He followed his spiritual intuition and headed for the ancient Nois City's center. The situation here made him believe that the person who had once ruled the Nois ruins definitely had enough intelligence. The reason why the City of Silver wasn't silenced probably had to do with an Amon parasite following behind. Yes, it could also be because of the True Creator... As he casually let his thoughts wander, Klein quickly arrived at a relatively intact cathedral.Inside the cathedral stood a statue of a demonic wolf with eight legs. It was covered with short and dark hair. There was a tuft of grayish-white fur at the top of the statue head. Its pitch-black pupils covered at least three-quarters of its eyes. It's not Flegrea... The Dark Demonic Wolf that occasionally appeared in the Third Epoch, the God of Wishes? \"He\" has been in the Forsaken Land of the Gods for thousands of years and has finally found that Sequence 1 Beyonder characteristic? Just as this thought flashed through his mind, Klein suddenly heard footsteps coming, resounding one after another. He saw a figure slowly walking through the thin fog before its outline quickly formed. He was nearly 2.3 meters tall, with a slight hunch to his back. With grizzled hair, wrinkles at the corners of his eyes, and a scar at the corner of his mouth, he looked like an old priest or bishop while donning a long black clergyman's robe."}

Klein saw her emotions turn into a \u2018thinking blue', a normal reaction. She slowly looked up and said, \"I've met him before.\" Klein was stunned in disbelief. He felt like a shortsighted man who was wearing glasses that suited him. He could even faintly make out the details within Angelica's aura. His Spirit Vision turned clearer. He realized that his potion had begun to produce clear signs of digestion. He checked his body condition and reflected on his past experiences. He then took out the portrait and entered the club. He met the beautiful attendant, Angelica. She had seen too many people in the club who claimed to see through the truth and fate after learning divination methods. The more you know how small we are, the better you can understand how small you truly are, she told him. She then gave him the portrait of a man she had seen in a dream. The man was a policeman investigating Mr. Vincent's death. He looked at Angelica and said: \"I don't find it odd no matter what revelation you receive, for you are a true Seer.\" She replied: \"Yes, I am certain of that. I don't even know his name. To be honest, if it wasn't you, I would have suspected that any person showing me a portrait like this is Klein could basically narrow the essence of the \u2018acting' technique to \u2018actions corresponding to the name of the potion' Only by doing so could he change the state of his body, heart, and soul, making them closer to the remnant psyche in the potion, so as to gradually digest it. The acknowledgment of a Seer's identity was only a factor on the surface. The reason why it made one's spirituality feel light had to do with how the feedback strengthened one's affirmation of particular divination actions. These actions collectively formed the rules for digesting the Seer potion. If it continues to be this successful, I won't need half a year. Perhaps in two or three months, or even two to three weeks time, I'll be ready to completely digest the potion. That sign was extremely obvious. It's no wonder the mysterious Mr. Zaratul said that the Beyonder will clearly sense it when the potion is fully digested. There's no need for anyone to teach them. It is what it is... Just like now, although my Spirit Vision has been enhanced a little, I know very well that this is only a pit stop in the digestion process and not the final destination. If this clue is of any use, you would've contributed greatly once again. May the Goddess bless us.\" Klein tapped four spots on his chest as abnormally devout as he appeared. For him, he needed to figure out the identity of the man in the A Seer lacked the means to directly engage in combat with an enemy. Instead, a Seer could similarly deal with anenemy using ritualistic magic. It was exactly how he resolved the magic mirror divination incident at Selena's house. He realized that Selena had likely been brought by Hanass Vincent to the underground market. This resulted in Elizabeth's knowledge of the Evil Dragon Bar as well. The gentleman that had witnessed the exchange of the Antigonus family's notebook. The man in the portrait who had some relationship with Hanass. Vincent have come here before. He had asked me if I had documents or items related to the main peak of the Hornacis mountain range. The librarian had casually mentioned that someone had just returned it. Therefore, he still remembered very cleverly and didn't need to flip through his name cards to determine if the man existed. He kept what was left in his tiny inner pocket. He patted the cash note in his pocket and pushed open the door and strode in. He saw a muscular old man walk out with a torn Admiral's jacket draped over his shoulders. The blue-eyed elder's arms were thick and brawny and had the bearing of a military officer. He was a former Tingen Mandated Punisher Captain... Rumor has it that he was once part of the Royal Navy...Klein replied politely, \"Yes.\" \"If you're in need of money, feel free to approach me.\""}

Audrey had planned on raising her request of purchasing the notebook to their next meeting in order to make her goal less obvious. However, in a friendly atmosphere and with the naturalness of their conversation, she sharply sensed that it was an opportunity. With the powers of Lie, she made her cheeks blush red. After some thought, she changed topics and asked if Michele Deuth would be willing to donate 1,000 pounds, a nearby piece of land spanning 2,000ares1, and a manor with rather good returns to the faculty at Stoen University. He bowed solemnly and said, \"My honorable lady, the importance you place on academia has left me touched. Its glow is enough to match your beauty and upbringing. I believe I have no reason to reject your invitation. Treat it as a gift from a sincere friend\" Audrey was delighted as she wished to praise herself, but she appeared indifferent and reserved. She didn't want to do anything that was improper, so she didn't say anything. Although, she said that the two items were definitely not worth 10,000pound it wouldn't result in any loss on her part. She then successfully obtained the Hypnotist potion formula from the Psychology Alchemicalists. The second goal was to enhance her standing, standing, and image via academic research and the preservation of relics. This was something most nobles and tycoons needed to do Audrey Hall received the Sauron royalty's helmet and a notebook from the Twenty Year War. She had used methods derived from mysticism to do her checks, but they were to no avail. She planned to turn the notebook in to the Psychology Alchemists. But she suddenly had a new idea. Perhaps I can find the knight's final location using divination with the help of the notebook. And this might be related to a dragon! Since it's a dragon, there's a high chance that it is a mind dragon, a representative of the Spectator pathway. Clues involving it would indeed be something the PsychologyAlchemists will pay close attention to. Audrey's eyes turned crystal clear as it seemed to hide a clear resplendence. She couldn't help but turn her head and looked at the golden retriever sitting by the side. Susie glanced at her owner and barked. \"Audrey, do you want me to praise you?\" Audrey turned her head back, feeling a little embarrassed. \"He isn't my father or teacher, but a real god\" she replied. \"I'm sorry, Susie, I don't mean to be rude, but I just don't want to be disrespectful to my father. He's not a teacher or a god, he's just a man.\" \"I know, I know. I'm so sorry, I'm sorry. I just wanted to talk to you about something.\" Using such a method is way too casual and somewhat sacrilegious...Audrey's thoughts slowly went from Mr. Fool to divination. Although she was incapable of divination, she had a certain level of understanding in the corresponding knowledge. It was to seek the help of a third party's strength-an unknown or mysterious existence-via a certain ritual. The most classic example was magic mirror divination! It's indeed very dangerous, but the danger stems from the possibility that the target is filled with malice or one that can cause a person to break down immediately. But I don't have such worries. I can seek Mr. fool's help!Audrey blinked and held down her agitation as she said to the golden retriever, \"Susie, guard the door outside. I will use a mysticism method to study this notebook\" She lit a candle while facing the mirror and recited the honorific name of The Fool to request the use of magic mirrordivination. \"Don't worry. I'll make the plea to a safe existence,\" Audrey said. \"Alright.\" Susie determined that Audrey was speaking the truth. \"Audrey, you need to be careful about being possessed by a mysterious existence.\" \"I know,\" Audrey replied without feeling worried at all. \"As a mysterious and unknown existence, I can be the third force in a magic Mirror divination...Klein allowed it while feeling amused.

I have to use both the methods at the same time... Backlund contains the opportunities for me to become powerful. I'll head to Backlund first...Klein sighed and made a decision. He enveloped himself with spirituality and stimulated a descent, exiting the gray space above the fog. When he returned to the world, he slowly walked out of his hiding spot towards Dunn Dunn's grave. He stared deeply at the picture and epitaph, then he fell into a deep sleep with the help of Cogitation. The scene that appeared after the foggy world shattered was the same as the one Klein slowly drew a crimson moon on his chest and walked out of the cemetery. He managed to leave the cemetery easily, without causing any alarm. He followed the gravel road into Tingen, using the shade of the trees as cover. Klein walked alone, his thoughts running wild and unbridled. He sometimes considered his plan for revenge, sometimes thinking back to the times he spent with the Captain. He let out a bitter smile and muttered with a self-deprecating tone, \"If I went up and knocked on the door, Melissa might faint from shock... Benson would be so nervous his hair would start to drop. He would then try his best to calmly convince me, in the name of a curly-haired baboon...\" He realized that he was standing on Daffodil Street. Opposite him was the house he shared with his brother and sister. He didn't have any other belongings on him except for the clothes he was wearing, his topaz pendulum, and Azik's copper whistle. But, as someone who was \"dead,\" hedidn't have pounds, nor soli, nor pennies. He decided to make do by finding a place to sleep for the time being and head to the Tingen branch Klein spent 38 pounds on two sets of formal wear, two shirts, two trousers, two pairs of leather boots, two bow ties, four pairs of socks, as well as two thick double-breasted jackets. He also bought a cane, a wallet, and a leather luggage bag. He rented a private carriage directly to the train station in Tingen in order to avoid meeting anyone familiar. He then hid in a shady area on the opposite side and looked at the door to his house. There were many times when he felt like heading over, but he couldn't bring himself to cross the wide street. He was happy that the Loen Kingdom didn't have a strict census. He could prove his identity just by using the water and gas bills, asWell as his rent for the past three months. Purchasing a train ticket was even easier, as all he needed was money. He had an empty feeling in his heart as he was about to leave for Backlund from Tingen. He wanted to see his siblings again. He suddenly realized why he hadn't picked an earlier train but instead bought a ticket for the two o'clock train. He laughed bitterly, for he thought about the tortoise that Melissa called a \"puppet,\" Benson and Melissa continued walking forward, silently watching the various performances. Some time later, they saw a clown running towards them. His face was painted in colorful pastels. He wanted to approach them, but he didn't dare to.Suddenly, he touched the wallet in his jacket and had an idea. He conjured a flower out of thin air. It was a Seville Chrysanthemum. The flower was golden in color and symbolized happiness. The clown brought the flower before Melissa and Benson. All they saw was a wide smile plastered over the pastel face. It's a happy smile, an exaggerated smile, a ridiculous smile. (End of the First Volume) It was the first time Benson and Melissa had seen each other together. They were shocked. They had never met before and were in a state of shock. They didn't know what to say to each other. They looked at each other in a daze. They couldn't believe what they had just seen. It had been a dream. It wasn't a dream at all. But it was a real dream, and it was going to become a reality. It would be the happiest day of Benson's life."}

I believe I still owe you one page.\" \"I was away from land this week and haven't found any new pages.\" Alger placed his right hand near his chest and bowed in apology. \"No matter. I expected my request to take a long time.\" Klein leaned back into his chair and tapped the armrest with his index finger. \"You can express the contents of the diary now.\" Audrey bowed slightly and said, \"As you wish.\" A pen suddenly appeared before her and she tried her best to transcribe them. \"A weak organization is the best place for me to display my abilities! I never expected him to be the leader of an ancient organization, the Secret Order!\" Klein's pupils constricted when he read this. \"Did I join an organization without a future? No, I should think of it this way; only a blank piece of paper can produce a good painting.... I was lucky, that he isn't angry with me... I was too reckless, too insolent too foolish in trying to observe him.\" Audrey snapped back to her senses and turned her head to look at the dark red star. Klein read the diary several times before looking at Justice and The Hanged Man again. Audrey was still shocked, forgetting that she was a Spectator. She asked Mr. Zaratul how long it would take to digest the Spectator potion if I used the acting method, and what standards I should use to determine if I had digested it completely. He told her that for the lower Sequences, it would only take half a year to Digest the potion as long as one strictly used theacting method. He then deliberated before saying, \"The typical rule of thumb is to wait three years and confirm that you no longer feel restless or receive any auditory or visual illusions. There is one simple test to determine when you can. That method is to exhaust your body to its limit. If you still don't hear any maniacal murmurings or see any strange things at that point, that would mean that you're ready to advance\" Audrey looked at The Hanging Man and organized her words. \"Where can I find the Psychology Alchemists?\" She then asked, \"All I want is to have plenty of time to prepare so that I can approach them more naturally. I don't think it'll take three years.\" That wasn't useful at all... Three years, that's too long...Audrey criticized inwardly. She had just thought this when she heard an armrest being tapped. She saw an edge of the edge of The Fool-Sequence about Audrey asked, \"Mr. Fool, have you considered adding more members?\" Klein leaned back casually. He had long prepared an answer. Alger: \"I've heard that a Listener from the Aurora Order is searching for traces of the True Creator, which is the holy residence they advocate\" \"True Creator?\" Audrey asked, puzzled. \"It is an ancient entity worshiped by numerous secret organizations and cults. They believe that the Creator hasn't completely perished. The Core he left behind is the true Creator,\" Alger said. \"I am more inclined to call him, the Fallen Creator,\" he added. \"The True Creator has appeared in many forms, such as The Hanged Giant or the Eye behind the Shadow Curtains.

This security company's signboard is really nothing but a signboard...Klein immediately held back his urge to lampoon when he heard the visitor. How he yearned for there to be a message board and a screen for him to share his thoughts. But he soon realized that he had once asked a similar question. The captain's answer was that they could take on jobs if they were free. The money earned could be used as funding for the team's petty cash account and bonuses for the participants. \"Don't tell me you want Bredt to take the mission? Or yourself?\" Klein was still a novice and was truly inadequate in various aspects. With one hand holding his umbrella, the lanky man's expression turned gloomy as he took off his hat. He bowed and said, \"Sorry for intruding. Goodbye.\" Klein decided to stay at Blackthorn Security Company due to the ongoing rain. He took out some newspapers and sat on the soft but bouncy sofa as he leisurely began his \u2018afternoon break' He flipped through the Tingen City Honest Paper when a particular piece of news suddenly caught his attention. The suspect responsible for killing Mr. Welch and Miss Naya has been caught. We believe it is a much-needed reprieve from the horror that has gripped North Borough, Golden Indus Borough, and East Borough... Welch's father, Mr Welch's mother, and Mr Welch Klein was about to take a nap in the break room when a knock came from the door of the reception hall again. Rozanne, who was nodding off, suddenly jolted awake. The lanky man from before walked in once again. He had made two trips despite the heavy afternoon storm while still willing to wait. The Nighthawks must have easily resolved missions that might seem very difficult to others. They must have accrued quite a reputation. The security industry had entered a golden age. Yet, Blackthorn Security Company was not affected in any way. It was apparent how dismally the company was run. The man left his umbrella outside the door and as he walked to the sofa, he replied with a rueful smile, \"I have traveled the nearby streets and paid a visit to all the mercenaries, uh-security companies and private investigators. You are my only hope. To be frank, if not for the waiter that delivers meals, I really did not imagine that there was another security company here.\" Klein was stunned. How did he not discover someone's return? He had been sitting there, staring at the door. He didn't find it odd that he was not invited to Welch's and Naya's burials, nor did he feel depressed.

Let's hope it will be completed successfully... I wonder how useful my Seer abilities will be...\" Rozanne completed a simple contract that had only a few clauses. After receiving one copy of the contract, Klee stood up and bowed with his hat off. He seemed to be in deep thought. He suddenly turned his head toward Klein and revealed a smile. He said, \"I need your help.\" \"Ah?\" Klein was taken aback. He found them too unprofessional."}

After taking nearly fifteen minutes to recover, Klein made his second attempt at letting the other third of his marionettes die. He then realized that the darkness in the Forsaken Land of the Gods wasn't as dangerous as Little Sun had described. He could slowly recover his strength by absorbing the Beyonder characteristics of the Seer pathway. After a series of tasks, Klein set up a bonfire, and he placed a white rabbit on it. He brushed it with a full set of condiments he made himself, like basil, fennel, and salt, as he constantly turned the meat over. As Klein seriously roasted the rabbit, he gave a self-deprecating laugh. \"Besides, how can I not maintain the best state if I escape from the sliver of hope, I can only challenge my psychological limits?\" Klein added inwardly at the same time, \"This was stronger than the Ancient Bane's Transformation Curse's 3 Sequence of Silence!

The water was sloshing in the river, but when the dim yellow light shone at it, or when the lightning in the sky lit up the area, Klein realized that there was no water in the Riverbed.

Amon replied with a slight nod, unfazed with the question. \"I'm looking forward to it.\" Klein continued his work until he prepared rations for three or four meals. He then turned the remaining ingredients next to the fire into dry rations.

The faint black colors that permeated the area had clearly faded, but there was an indescribable feeling. Bernadette felt that it was heavy, as though there was something there. She saw the fingernails of her five fingers extending. The mausoleum began to tremble visibly. She followed the instincts of a Clairvoyant and from all the experience she had accumulated over time, she completely left the primitive forest and entered the empty area where the Emperor's Black Mausolum was. During this process, she felt the spirit of the spirit world return to the earth. She was wearing an Intis-styled blouse with a large lace flower around the collar, an indigo patterned captain's uniform, a pair of beige trousers, knee-length boots, and a triangular hat with feathers on it.

An eight-legged demonic wolf began to run madly between the trees. All the supernatural beings and mutated creatures on this island stirred as they rushed towards the mausoleum. Her spiritual perception and the Sealed Artifact on her body had failed to detect it in advance or attempt to stop it. It was as though she was powerless to deal with such an influence.

The baby in her womb failed to obtain such a state as it fell to the ground. It already had facial features and limbs. Its skin was wrinkled, and it was dripping with sticky pus. It tried its best to open its eyes, which were sealed by the sticky liquid. It opened its mouth wide open in a bid to make a final struggle.

But the danger and pain they endured were ever so real.Perhaps there would be a day when my enemy will be one of my teammates...Klein sighed silently. He felt the heavy weight that all Nighthawk, Mandates, and Machinery hivemind carried. He emphasized in his heart: \"I'm not such a person! I'm not a hero at all! I just want to go home and have dinner with my friends.\" He turned to Old Neil and said, \"Enjoy your dinner at home, I'll get Swain to compensate me after all.\" He boarded the carriage quickly and returned to Daffodil Street. He asked, concerned, \"Are you hurt?\" Old Neil chuckled briefly before saying, \"I got stabbed by one of the shrapnel earlier. If I was still young, I definitely would've been able to dodge it. Luckily, it's just a small cut.\" He moved his right hand slightly to let Klein see the tiny wound that was still lightly bleeding on the back of Audrey Hall left the party with her personal maid, Annie, and entered the bedroom that the Viscount had prepared. She put on a black hooded robe that she had prepared ahead of time. With the fine checkered fishnet drooping down, her facial features became even more indiscernible. Audrey stuffed her feet into leather ankle boots, looked to the side, and told Annie, \"Wait for me here. No matter who comes, do not open the door.\" She then walked quickly down and out the door of the viscount's residence where she saw that there was already a carriage waiting there. The two of them got into the carriage and left the villa and got back to Audrey's home in Backlund, Sweden. Audrey later wrote a book about her experiences at the visount's residence, and it was published in 2012. The book, \"The ViscOUNT's Daughter,\" is published by Simon & Schuster, priced \u00a316.99, and is available in English and German.

They were accompanied by Apprentice Fors Wall and Tribunal Xio Derecha. The quartet arrived at a house and knocked on the door. The door squeaked and opened to reveal a black-robed man on a single seat sofa. The man introduced himself as Mr. A, a powerful Beyonder. Audrey noticed that his gaze moved up and down her body like two slippery tentacles wanting to tear off my clothes. She carefully observed and made a judgment calmly, but she nearly had goosebumps. The group then left the house and went to a different house. The meeting was held at the house of a man named Mr. B, the leader of the gathering. He was wearing a hood and hiding his looks under a shadow. He looked at all the guests in silence, giving people a feeling that he was somehow in a commanding position. His gaze is very disgusting, Audrey thought. He is very confident, but his gaze is also very disgusting. The four of them then went to another house and met a man called Mr. C, who was in a traditional knight training suit. He also had a black hood and a shadow covering his face. He said, \"This is a secret meeting, so don't be offended if you don't want to know what's going on.\" The four then went back to the other house and waited until the meeting was over."}

Or maybe he used a Sealed Artifact which possesses immense danger?Regardless of the possibility, it shows that Mr. Fool's adorer is extremely powerful...Regardless, I certainly provided clues, so Mr. Hanged Man has to carry out his promise and pass me the pituitary gland of a Rainbow Salamander. This should be ourTarot Club's very first mission, right?\" Count Hall asked. Audrey nodded obediently. \"Audrey, I know that you're very interested in mysticism, and I normally tolerate it. But you mustn't be involved in this. You can't even ask about it. You will be introduced by the Queen to the Backlund social scene events by the end of this year. As an adult, you should clearly know and remember that a terrifying Beyonder, or a powerful, hidden organization, is equivalent to danger. Do you understand that?\" Audrey replied charmingly, \"I was just a little curious.\" \"Curiosity won't do either!\" Count Hall emphasized, and Audrey's father, Count Hall, asked her why she was so worried. She told him about Qilangos's death. He agreed to pay a bounty on her behalf. The reward was three hundred thousand pounds. She was extremely thrilled. The satisfaction derived from receiving a forty thousand pound bounty, getting her father's compliment, and the reward of a Rainbow Salamander's pituitary gland that she was going to get from The Hanged Man amplified her happiness. She decided to gather more pages of Emperor Roselle's diary to thank Mr. Fool for answering her prayers. Her next course of action was to find out who the killer was and get the money back. She went to Duke Negan's mansion, in a secret study room. He was smoking a cigar as he looked at the Spellsinger of God-Ace Snake, Prime Minister Aiur Negan, and others opposite him. Prime Minister Aguesid Negan had just rushed over from the King's side. He said, \"We've determined that it wasn't any of the High-Sequence Beyonders that we're familiar with. Of course, we believe that it's a powerful, mysterious Beyonder we aren't aware of or a dangerous haven.

He was momentarily stunned as he quickly fished out a penny and bought the Tingen Morning Post. He looked at the glove before him.

On the other hand, it indirectly proves that the ancient goddess Lilith has lost her Sequence 0 position, which  is generally equivalent to dying. The greatest suspect is the Goddess who had snatched  the title of Lady of Crimson, but \"She's\" already Sequence 0, corresponding to \"The Star\" in the Cards of Blasphemy. The Fool plays a key role in \"Her\" revelation. If that's true, then in a certain way,  it's an invitation for \"cooperation\"... But how am I to cooperate with a yet-to-disappear ancient goddess?

He chose \"The Moon\" as a code name. The Dark Emperor card and the purification of the Sun Brooch would thoroughly disperse Emlyn White's psychological cue. Emlyn's will will pass through the earth. He will be the key to saving the Sanguine. The Moon is the only card that can dispel the cue in Emlyn. The card is the Dark Emperor, the card that is used in the Book of Secrets.

If the war developed to the point where both parties were blinded with bloodlust, the Blue Mountain Island where Bayam was located might be completely submerged by the sea and become a ruin. The powerhouses from Feysac and Feynapotter were indeed capable of stopping the situation from collapsing, but how much power could they divert to this peripheral battlefield in the Rorsted Archipelago? Colin Iliad cast his gaze at Derrick Berg, who appeared less physically developed when placed in contrast to his surroundings.

Even though Moon City had held the most complete rituals and repeatedly chanted the honorific name, there had been no response. It was obvious that the ancient sun god and the City of Silver Creator would have considered this problem. One possibility was that the person who walked out of the grayish-white fog was extremely careful. He was very cautious and didn't enjoy being watched or monitored. After discovering the patrol team in Moon City, he would be inclined to use his Beyonder powers to affect their minds, making them forget that they had seen him or recited the honorIFIC name. He said in a strange tone, \"Chernobyl\"...\" Klein's mind froze for a second before he let out a silent sigh. He had already had some vague ideas on his mind, but he was still unable to truly sort them out.

He followed her advice, and from their conversation, they followed his treatment. They left behind what was sufficient for the rangers of the forest to submit to their masters. Audrey immediately activated her \"Traveling ability\" to quell the residents of Backlund for some time, but she felt a little depressed because she knew that even if she gathered a large amount of food, she could only quell it for a short time. She decided to seek Mr. World's advice to see if he had any suggestions for how to deal with the situation. She then took out a hard-covered bronze notebook and flipped to a page with \"Teleportation\" She then threw bags of food into the black pocket and closed the door of the warehouse she had rented from Xio, Fors-Leymano, and Feynapotter. But she didn't smile at all. Instead, she sighed softly and said, \"It's still not enough... I'm still lacking plenty... Dozens of times I'll have to move them with only Traveler's Bag...

The former's body was suddenly surrounded by a violent wind, sweeping him towards the wall, and with a clang, a large hole was blown through the wall.

Along the way, he didn't evade or dodge, but the decorative vases and other objects in the corridor seemed to have found lives of their own and avoided him in ingenious ways.

That would resolve many of his doubts. That's why I didn't call him father for many years. It's because he did too many things against the trend of the times and hurt the innocent. I couldn't accept my heroic father turning into a crazy tyrant... \" She said. \"I understand that he was suffering from despair, pain, and loneliness. I understand him as a drowning person, only struggling on instinct.\" When Klein heard that, he sighed and felt his emotions in turmoil. \"At your level, you should more or less know that there's corruption coming from the cosmos.\" He said. The original entity here referred to Emperor Roselle, who might've succeeded before being \"assassinated\" This way, when he revived from the astral world and regained his Uniqueness and absorbed the three Sequence 1 characteristics, he would no longer absorb the characteristics of Knowledge Emperor,Arcane Scholar, and another pathway. He could make himself pure; thus, free from madness. This was a way to live through death, but the prerequisite was that Rosellle's ritual had succeeded. He had died during or after the ritual, and not before the ritual. The Black Emperor does have the ability to revive, but once a new Black Emperor appears, the original entity would perish completely. This is the method needed for summoning my messenger,\" said Bernadette calmly. The fountain pen that was originally placed diagonally in front of her suddenly jumped up, as if it was held by an invisible elf before writing fluidly on the paper. \"We can cooperate on stopping George III.\" Klein sighed and said, \"I'll give you the method to summon my messenger.\" \"Alright.\" Bernadettes reached out her right hand and lightly tapped the table. \"I'm also doing such things for something that has slim chances, one that's almost impossible to happen. You want to stop George III?\" \"Yes.\" Klein nodded frankly. \"Why?\" Bernadett pressed in an unperturbed tone. \"Some ridiculous reasons that aren't worth mentioning.\""}

Klein detected this attempt via the changes in his Spirit Body Threads, so he rapidly created a marionette at the critical moment and swapped locations. \"He\" pinched the monocle embedded deep in \"His\" eye socket and looked around, saying with a smile, \"Your actions often expose your problems. To a master of deceit, everything that you did was enough for me to detect your weakness. Even if my avatar is inferior to you, it's still easy to break you down. You wouldn't even be capable of dying even if you wish for it.\" \"I'm afraid you will feel a deep sense of guilt,\" \"Him\" said. \"If a magic mirror is willing to listen to your instructions and deliberately ingratiate itself towards you, then it means that you aren't as simple as I imagined you to be,\" Klein replied. \"You're trying to steal my destiny,\" Amon replied, \"No, I'm not.\" \"You've finally noticed that he wore he wore it,\" Klein said, \"and I'm going to kill him!\" \"I've been waiting for this moment for a long time,\" Amon responded. \"It's time to end this battle,\" Klein added, \"before it gets any worse than it already is.\" \"This is the end of the battle,\" Amon said, Klein appeared on a tree. Amon kept appearing in front of him as they continued their \"conversation\" Klein didn't answer as he kept switching positions with his marionettes. Even if you were to shout for help or create an explosion, the pedestrians and servants in the room wouldn't be able to hear a thing. Even in midair, Leonard Mitchell ignored this scene, rushing for 39 Boklund Street at high speeds. At this moment, Pallez Zoroast's slightly-aged voice sounded in this Red Gloves's mind:\"Turn back. Head to Unit 160.'ipientAlthough Leonard was puzzled, his experienced self didn't ask why when it came to supernatural matters. He immediately swung the direction Word of the Sea pointed and changed directions. He said, \"This is what I've been waiting for!\" as he triggered the Evernight Emblem that he had been clasping tightly. \"He\" pressed the crystal monocle on \"His\" right hand, as his smile grew in obvious delight. He continued speaking in irresistible delight, \"It's \"To be the abnormalities of this region in this region of the world\" \"His actions changed, this Blasphemer\" adjusted, and at this moment a strange gloom fell over the entire street. It was as if the entire city had been engulfed in a cloud of smoke and flames. \"This was the beginning of the end,\" he said. \"It was the start of a new era\" It was as though the entire place had been separated from reality, turning into a secret. Hazel had already sensed something amiss as she frantically looked at the others in the room. Her mother, Ma'am Riana, took off the accessory on her nose and wore a monocle that she had taken out of somewhere. The servants standing beside her all took out a similar monocled and wore it on their right eye. At this point, Amon had already lowered \"His\" right hand from his monocles. Landing in Amon's palm wasn't a glove but a rat, a rat that had died after becoming a marionette. He then threw out the item he had previously taken out, and he threw it at his target. It was a paper crane. The technique of relying on the gathering of avatars to raise one's level is already outdated. \"He\" said with a smile, \"Pallez, it's already 1350 of the Fifth Epoch. It's already time to raise your level. You can do it!\" He then raised his hand and the glove vanished. However, along with the human-skinned glove's disappearance, Gehrman Sparrow also did. He made Creeping Hunger turn transparent. A transparent book condensed in front of him. A paper crane appeared in his hand. The book then disappeared. The paper crane then appeared in the middle of the room and flew away."}

Danitz puffed out his chest, raised his neck, and was filled with a stirring sense of self-sacrifice. He didn't want his captain to meet such a dangerous and crazy fellow. But he has a terrifying organization backing him! You want to hurt Captain? Over my dead body! He then thought with a silent, mocking smile. \"I'm not leaving. I want to see what you can do! I will not bring danger to Captain!\" He then left for Symeem Island, which was the furthest from the City of Generosity, Bayam. It took nearly five hours on a liner to reach it. On the way, Klein bought a suit with local characteristics and a small suitcase to replace the clothes he changed out of, for a total of fourteen soli. They weren't even worth a pound. It's just change compared to a complete suit... It's really cheap. It was sold for 3,825 pounds. Although I haven't received the pirate bounties net me 3,000 pounds, I can basically include it into my budget as long as I don't have to pay for the ferry at 10. o'clock. He had to miss the 9.'clock ferry and could only take the 10.' clock ferry to pay Klein found 26 pounds, 11 soli, and 8 pence from Steel Maveti's body. The Nightmare Beyonder characteristic and the murloc's bladder are still worth something. The money he has left will be enough to buy a decent manor here, in Desi Bay, in the Southern Continent's colonies, and in the non-metropolitan areas. He also has a 10% stake in the Backlund Bike Company, and his future returns won't be low. The ideal solution would be to sell it to the Church. He hoped that Little Sun would soon reach Sequence 7 and be qualified to gain clearance to the methods used to remove the mental corruption from a beyonder characteristic. He wasn't in a hurry. Little Sun had just received the potion formula for Sequence 7, so he had no need for it at the moment. He would have to wait for a long time, and the powers of a Priest of Light was very effective in dealing with a pirate like Admiral of Blood in a way that was far more potent than the Sun Brooch. He wiped his face with his hand, turning his face into a tall, thin Wendt with rather distinct facial features. It was then that he saw the winery run by Raine's family. The girl with flaxen-colored hair could no longer be called a young girl. She had obviously matured a lot compared to what he remembered. He took a deep breath and slowly let it out. Klein spoke in a local dialect, with a somewhat nondescript Bayam accent. The language of the Rorsted Archipelago was derived from ancient Feysac and belonged to another variant. \"Raine, I like you. I wish to marry you. The reason I said it out loud today isn't to get an answer, but because I'm afraid that I would never have the chance to tell you again\" Raine suddenly scolded angrily, \"Wendt, you're a coward!\" He had to pretend to be chased away pathetically, running all the way to a nearby alley. There, he hit his head against the wall while silently cursing himself. Raine quickly woke up and realized that she had fallen asleep without knowing it. Everything that had happened just now appeared like a dream. She remained sitting there, motionless for quite a while.Suddenly, she lowered her head and let out a sharp curse that seemed to come from the depths of her throat. \"You selfish bastard! You selfish bastard!\" Klein felt a tiny sensation of digesting his potion, left the place, and left the island in the morning. He would have to spend the night on Symeem Island until the morning, as there were no liners until the Bayam Island in the afternoon. He was going to chase after a treasure trove, and I don't know when I'll be able to come back. He overcame his goosebumps that were about to"}

He was unable to believe the fact that this crazy adventurer and bounty hunter had actually gone to university and even graduated! He had no way of putting a university-a hallmark of wisdom-with that of Gehrmen Sparrow together! Danitz decided to do something about the situation. He coughed twice and faced Vice Admiral EdWina Edwards and said, \"Captain, Mr. Gehr man Sparrow has some questions for you?\" He then let out a sigh of relief. If this stare down continued, he felt as though his persona would collapse. He didn't directly ask about mermaids, as he didn't want her to see through his real purpose, which would lead to unnecessary accidents. He quickly calmed his mood and said: \"Second question, do you know how to remove the mental corruption from a Beyonder characteristic?\" She shook her head. \"I don't know. I once imagined that it's possible by borrowing the power of an external force and reducing it to the smallest specks. This way, whether it's corrupted or slowly cursed, they would scatter or slowly vanish. As for the Beyonder characteristics, they will gather by bit due to their particular traits, eventually taking form again\" She then wrote and drew: \"Set off from Sonia Island, sail 1 Vice Admiral Iceberg can replicate or simulate the Beyonder powers of her opponents when they use them in front of her. Danitz, who had been listening by the side, had a dazed look on his face. Klein asked, \"Do you know where there are people who can make mystical items out of Beyonder ingredients or characteristics?\" Edwina answered frankly, \"I have grasped the corresponding knowledge. I can simulate it, but I cannot guarantee the success rate.\" Danitz curiously asked,  \"Captain, is it really the giants'?\"Edwina gave an affirmative answer. \"That batch of documents showed that there were still many giants active in the Fourth Epoch. Some of them had switched faiths to the God of Combat, while the others were left scattered, becoming the hunting targets of the humans. The sunken ship we discovered, along with some of the items inside, are very similar to the relics they left behind in their original settlement, so we have sufficient reason to believe that the lost King's Court belongs to the giants\" Danitz didn't say a word, but listened to Vice AdmiralIceberg's description of the City of Silver Sun and the Forsaken Land of the Gods. He quietly listened to her description, but he quietly said it's not far from the word 'Giant King's Little Sun' Klein's thoughts began to wander and he forcefully reined them back, and he nodded as if he was thinking about something. In this aspect, I'm stronger than \u2018Them'\u00a0- Klein. \"If I offer a sufficient price, are you willing to sell the key?\" \"Of course, unless I acquire additional clues to the Giant King's Court.\" Edwina continued to speak at a moderate pace. \"The Element Dawn is headed by Bernadette? Zaratul's prophecy is quite accurate after all. She can really be considered an important figure in the Beyonder world\" \"What kind of cooperation?\" Klein asked. \"They've always been fighting against the Moses Ascetic Order. It really isn't for money, and their goal is definitely something from the abandoned temple.\" \"What do you know about Element Dawn?\" \"It combined the elements of various schools of mysticism. It had its own set of theories, and its members were all proficient in spell casting and had mastery in many ancient witchcraft techniques\" \"I don't know anything about it,\" Klein said. \"I just want to know if you can help me with something.\" \"Yes, I can help you with something,\" she replied. \"What is it?\" \"The key to the Hidden Sage.\" \"The Hidden Sage is the key to understanding the past and the future.

Between the rubble and soil, there were only a few signs of crushed bone and rotting clothes. The dark gold and deep blue light from before had all vanished. The Beyonder characteristics have been taken away by the Nighthawks and Machinery Hivemind...Senor's expression twitched as it perfectly reflected Klein's mood. The evil spirit wasn't completely obliterated? It had long escaped? Klein thought about it when he suddenly came to an alarming conclusion. If a living person had entered and exited this room over the past half year, a Wraith should be able to sense it. Besides, the deity statues obviously cannot be seen by the nighthawks or the Machinery hivemind. The room where the evil spirit was sealed had likewise been destroyed and buried.

He knew very well that Lanevus would be staying in the dormitory provided by the Dock Union at night. His target was the clock tower of the East Balam Dock. He waited for two hours in the rich darkness, patiently waiting for the predetermined show. Three figures dressed in black robes suddenly appeared in front of the two-story, brick-red building. They were led by a man with short golden brown hair and blackish-green eyes which appeared to be as deep as a windless lake. The man in the lead didn't wear a hat, revealing his short golden Brown hair, blackish Green eyes, and silver-white suitcase. He was wearing a clown mask, with the corner of its mouth sharply raised and a painted red nose. He looked at the slowly descending airship and made a guess. It was likely that the airship wouldn't engage in combat, but rather provide air surveillance of the area to give the personnel involved in the operation a better view and prevent the target from escaping if any accidents occurred. It's silent... Is this a temporary result caused by Beyonder means? Crestet Cesimir was one of the three powerhouses of the Red Gloves and he happened to be in Backlund. A bone sword, that was less than a meter-long, emitted glossy, pure white light as it slowly floated up. Its blade had an ancient silver-coated mirror attached to it. The scenes reflected in the mirror were layered and superimposed without end. The Union members in this small brick-red building exploded one after another in their dreams, without even having the chance to scream. Their bodies split into pieces, turning into thick, sticky flesh. Half of their bodies rushed towards the \"Giant\" to weave into cloaks that could reduce magical damage. The other half condensed into furry giant rugs that blanketed the three Nighthawks. The blood-colored raindrops accurately avoided Cesimir and the others before falling to the ground and quickly corroding into deep, dark traces. The corners of Cesimir's mouth curled up, and with a slip of his foot, he instantly appeared in front of 'Giant' Three shadows appeared around Cesimir in succession, and he said to his subordinate, \"Use Sealed Artifact 1-63.\" \"Yes, Your Grace.\" Cesimir heard the shuffling of footsteps which echoed in the silence and serenity. He saw Lanevus with his chiseled face dressed in a linen shirt walking down the dark staircase. He appeared calm and placid without any signs of fear. He yanked open his linen shirt, revealing the dark red flesh of his skinless chest and abdomen. The flesh and blood were conjoined together, forming the figure of a hanged man! All of a sudden, the void around them shattered like glass, and all the scenes around them crumbled. This was the aura of a deity.

However, they all mysteriously collapsed to the ground, having been forcefully taken down by many invisible entities!Bang! Bang! bang!Another Nighthawk fired, and the silver surface of the bullet seemed to bear the Evernight Sacred Emblem. The attackers were people from the Aurora Order.

The incomplete soul resulted in repeated deaths and resurrection just like Sequence 4's Undying. And due to the golden accessory inside his body, and the calling from the other half soul, Azik, who started a brand new life every incarnation, would gradually recover his past memories with the passage of time. The \"him\" Azik had seen was a feathered serpent with a face identical to his, even to the smallest detail. It was filled with extreme coldness and madness. If he became one with it again, he would probably be immediately restored to his state as a Death Consul before Death's fall. He had finally recalled everything that had happened, and he understood the reason why he was constantly dying and reviving, always losing his memories and having to recover them every single time. He also understood why the feathered. serpent suppressing the entire space in the depths of the black fog had an identical face as his. That was the other Azik. Eggers! He had seen it clearly.

He only wished to give it a try on Azik and Artificial Death. But when he approached, the entire mausoleum began shaking. The surroundings turned transparent, reflecting a world with countless skeletons and shadows. Klein's spiritual intuition told him that what was about to happen was not something he wished to see. However, he couldn't figure out what he could do. He didn't even dare open his eyes to look at Mr.Azik's present state or whatever he had encountered.

Klein didn't consider if the Fate Fate charm was effective if he didn't try it. He was delighted as he formulated the charm. He would suffer by his fate in his place in the place in his life that was created by his reviving. It wouldn't be as bad as the deaths he had previously suffered from the deaths that he wouldn't suffer again. It would be better than that. He raised his right hand and reached into his pocket. Gripped tightly in his palm was a black crystal card-like charm. At the same time, Azik was approaching the towering illusory feathered serpent. His footsteps sped up as though he was returning to his throne. However, his eyes which had pale-white flames were filled with pain. His expression was extremely warped. The intense shouting and desire made him lose control of himself. He was about to soar into the sky and leap towards the gigantic feathered Serpent that shared his face. A figure then materialized between Azik and the giant serpent. It was a beautiful lady wearing an ancient robe. She wore a black hood. Her face was deadpan, and her black eyes were deep and dark, devoid of spirituality. The pale- white flames in his eyes \"reflected\" the floating figure in midair. He finally held back that desire and the irresistible calling to fuse together. He said a single word in ancient Hermes, \"Fate!\" The surroundings suddenly quietened. There was no longer any sound. He froze for a moment as if he had been petrified into being a stone sculpture. His arm rose a little before landing back in its original location.

She had a hint of playfulness on her face. Klein suddenly recalled how Talim had fallen in love just recently. With his rich \"experience\" from the information age, he somehow came up with an extremely contrived romance story. The maid chuckled and said, \"Detective Moriarty, if you want to find out exactly what the lady and Mr. Talim were talking about, you can ask her directly.\" Klein confidently pushed out his scapegoat. He asked the maid, \"Were you with that lady on the day of Talim's funeral?\" The maid replied without much thought, \"Yes.\" \"What a coincidence...Klein sighed as he suddenly grasped a crucial point. On that day, it was the commoner lady he loved who had offered flowers in the prince's place!\" Klein was most concerned about the lady with the black veil and the sapphire ring on her finger.

He was relieved to have the energy to reflect on the whole situation-it was Prince Edessak's beloved commoner lady who had cursed Talim. He decided to bury the problem deep within his heart. He wasn't to probe or investigate! He hoped that the Machinery Hivemind, with my earlier reminder, will pay importance to this matter of noticing the royal family's abnormality.

He had to eliminate any interference in order to divine a particular matter. That was, after this advancement, when his spirituality wasn't stable yet, he didn't hearing the illusional ravings. He felt physically and mentally exhausted, and he held down his half top hat and walked quickly across the wet street to No. 15 Minsk Street under the illumination of the street lamps. Klein was surrounded by an illusory, thin layer of gray fog that was undetectable. He wanted to know if this was a natural change after ascending to Sequence 6, or if there was some other reason. He decided to explore the area and see if there were any changes. The moment he left the staircase of light, he lost his momentum and his Spirit Body's flight instinct. He plummeted straight down and landed on the bottom layer of the gray fog. The dream shattered. Klein opened his eyes and roughly understood the reason for the change. The gray fog has interwoven with reality, helping me block out the ravings that come from who knows where. After becoming a demigod, Klein should be able to see after becoming a Demigod.

He could've used Paper Figurine Substitutes or create an invisible air tube to pretend that he was using Underwater Breathing, but he had done none of that. In Nas and the Gargas Archipelago, the culinary methods for preparing beluga whale had transformed into a unique culture. There were all sorts of techniques and famous restaurants. He passed by the various whaling houses, seeing separated fat being carried out on cargo carriages towards nearby factories that spewed black smoke. They were oil refineries which were very unique to Gargas. He turned his head upon hearing the din and saw the tall populace with slightly blonde hair raising horizontal banners as they protested on the streets. He realized that many passersby were completely unfazed. Apart from a small bunch of spectators, the rest continued proceeding to their destinations. Do protests develop into riots? As expected of the Feysac Empire...Klein mumbled to himself, circled the street, and casually found an inn to stay. He continued registering Gehrman as a cause as a Church of the Goddess of Faceless. This because he had no plans on traveling through the fishing routes to find mermaids Klein was originally worried that he would encounter many Faceless here, meeting seven or eight Faceless simply from going next door to enjoy some whale cuisine. However, after serious consideration, he rationally eliminated this possibility. Beyonders from the Seer pathway were rare to begin with. Klein had only met three Beyonders who were beyond Sequence 8, and second, Sequence 6 Beyonders weren't commonly seen. Even in a playground for pirates, those who had 5,000-pound bounties were considered rare creatures. Once a Faceless had many preparations, they would seek out mermaids on a whaling boat. They would either begin having faith in the Goddess, sink to the bottom of the ocean, or become research personnel. It was very rare for them to stay on Gargas Archipelago for long. The harmonica that had fixed the summoning ritual of a spirit world creature, it matched Klein's inward intentions completely. It could be used for a year and a half. Klein didn't blame the Artisan for making changes without his permission. He went to Gray Amber Street the next morning and entered a sundry store named Hot Whale Dance. He discovered that the street lamps were sparse, but the lights from the houses lining the streets were bright. To a certain extent, they reduced the darkness of the night. He found that the light-colored patterns had a strange beauty. He had imagined such a scene-a crazy and powerful adventurer playing a sad tune on The Hermit Cattleya could clearly see The World. He had black hair and brown eyes, with a thin and angular face. The World was actually the crazy hunter, Gehrman Sparrow, who was considered at the level of a pirate admiral! The World had previously only relied on her eyes and other details to suspect that she was Admiral of Stars, but she wasn't certain. She had jumped in fright when The World, who had chosen to speak privately with her, immediately greeted her with \"Admiral of Stars\" It was partly because of this that she chose to take on The World's commission. She discovered that the true strength and standards of the Tarot Club members were far stronger than she had expected. Her eyes were deep black with a slight purple hue which was filled with mystery. The Hermit's eyes were very special, and he said, \"Can I understand that as a form of praise?\" She smiled, feeling somewhat enlightened, and asked, \"When can we set off?\" He didn't respond as he switched to asking, 'When can I go to Loen?' He was taken to a warehouse at the back of the warehouse. The boss asked, 'Who introduced you here?' \"Ma'am Gehrmuses,\" Klein said a name in the style of the local customs. \"Let me search for it. Let's see...\" the boss mumbled as he crouched. The room gradually turned dark as all the corners"}

She didn't involve herself in matters, as though she was an outsider at this gathering. Klein wasn't in a rush to read it like before. After all, he had already interacted and used a Grade 0 Sealed Artifact and knew what a Uniqueness of a Beyonder pathway looked like. He believed that there was nothing that could shock him greatly.Unless he was given a Demoness Blessing by some powerhouse with a unique ability and temporarily became a woman...Klein joked inwardly as he surveyed the long bronze table in interest. The Hermit's curiosity is different from Miss Justice's. She pays great attention to the matter of RoseLle's diary?Klein retracted his gaze and took note of this discovery. Then, he casually read the yellowish-brown goatskin. \"We plan on entering, to explore the Abyss.\" \"It's very quiet, and we didn't discover anything.\" \"We saw devils, but they were in the form of rotting corpses. Either corpses or silence; there's no end up ahead\" \"The Dark King has begun to show signs of corruption. I have to leave! I can't stay here any longer!\" \"I've had a few years, but fear of the unknown is like an invisible hand that clasps my heart tightly!\" \"I have to be alert about this state of mind that's mentioned in this entry... It might not exist in the past, but it doesn't mean it wouldn't appear in the future\" \"After advancing to Artisan, I finally have the powers to do that thing!\" \"There is a high chance that my transmigration was a result of it! There is an endless grayish-white fog beneath his feet! Could it be that our transmigrations have to do with this mysterious space? But why is the Emperor unable to enter, but I can? According to the Emperor's last few entries of the last stages of his life, he definitely didn't crack the mystery of the silver plate!\" \"Yes, I'll definitely become a demigod!\" \"I could slaughter an entire village just for a chicken! I'm the mysterious protagonist replicating the mysterious Earth!\" \"Grayish- white fog? The Emperor saw an endlessgrayish-White fog after replicating a silver plate from after his transmigration! The Emperor's eyes suddenly shrank when he read the diary entry when he saw the fog! He was in a moment of great despair! He wouldn't have thought of this place when he was in his moment of despair! Otherwise, he wouldn't be here!\" \"The higher the Sequence, the greater one's godhood is than their humanity... The higher they are, the more God-like they are!\" Derrick originally wished to bring forward his request to purchase the Sequence 6 potion formula after Solar High Priest, but Elder Lovia's release made him temporarily abandon his plans. He couldn't wait to mention everything that had happened, wishing to obtain the necessary guidance. Alger surveyed the area and voiced out, \"I need the potion formula of Ocean Songster.\" He's already a Sequence 6, a Wind-blessed... Isn't he someone from the Church of Storms? Why is he looking for the OceanSongster's potion formula elsewhere? Obtaining it internally from the church is a lot easier. He has secrets he wishes to keep from thechurch. Or was he just pretending to be someone from it? Cattleya instantly had many theories as she gently took note. The Hermit asked, \"Ma'am, is there anything you need? I can search for clues ahead of time, so as to trade for the potion Formula.\"Audrey thoughtfully retracted her gaze and similarly didn't request to purchasing anything. She didn't ask to purchase anything, however, as she didn't want to be seen with the Hermit. He made the diary pages in his hand vanish before he leaned back into his chair and said with a normal tone, \"You may begin.\" He recalled that deep in this mysterious space, there was a staircase of light that seemed to lead to heaven.

{"num_chp":321,"summary":"In the exhibition hall where Roselle's diary was kept, the two Machinery Hivemind members suddenly heard a clatter. In the washroom on the first floor, the box of matches exploded with a soft bang. A scarlet flame leaped up and ignited a paper towel, a potted plant, and the wooden door. The team member who spoke first nodded. \"Let's wait till the security guards pass by, we'll get them to check and confirm the situation. Captain told us to stay here and not to leave no matter what happens, especially not alone.\" In the event of an urgent emergency, they could evacuate with RoseLle's notebook. The priority to ensure the safety of the items was higher than capturing the intruder. Max Livermore ran at top speed. After passing through many exhibition halls, he finally saw the silhouettes of his two companions. At that moment, Klein had already passed through the doors and walls according to the layout in his memory. He had arrived right above the restored study. He was in no hurry to carry out any follow-up actions. Instead, he first looked down. As the stone floor was relatively thick, Klein was unable to vaguely confirm if there were any auras or emotions beneath him. He lifted his illusory and translucent right hand and soundlessly snapped his fingers. The flames didn't spread yet, but it was shocking enough. The nearby security personnel who heard the noise immediately rushed over. Klein was trying to prevent a powerful Beyonder, who could reconstruct the scene through magical means, from knowing which bookmark was abnormal. This was to prevent the investigator from suspecting Miss Justice who had only touched one bookmark. He passed through the glass case and steadily held the two bookmarks, then he wrapped them within his spirit body. He then appeared at the top of the long, mled table. He leaned back into his chair and said with a chuckle, \"Fortunately, I wasn't prepared for the state of my spirit body!\" The state of his body wasn't part of his powers. It didn't originate from the summoning. It stemmed from its special nature! Klein succeeded, as long as he wouldn't even need to try to escape to escape from the mysterious space above the gray fog. His illusory, nearly translucent figure instantly disappeared, leaving his whereabouts unknown! Even Azik's copper whistle and the twobookmarks which were wrapped in his spiritBody had vanished! The power of this ritual came from the power of the mysterious gray fog, which was above the majestic ancient palace. It was the source of all the power in the universe. The power was the Source of the Universe. The Source of The Universe is the Source Of The Universe, which is the Creator of the Cosmos, the Universe, and the universe itself. It is the creator of the universe, the universe and all that is within it. Klein used a specially concocted medication to neutralize the smell of the Holy Night Powder and the essential oils from the ritual. He left the bookmarks and Azik's copper whistle above the gray fog, and he didn't waste time returning to his body. He then took out his Master Key, planning to go through buildings before taking a rental carriage a distance away. After walking in a straight line for a while, he suddenly felt like he was unable to determine his position. His nose twitched as he smelled a strong stench of blood. He looked up and saw a lady laid out in the living room ahead of him. There was a large wound at her abdomen, and her internal organs seemed to have disappeared. At the same time, Klein heard grunting noises. His eyes lit up again, and the corners of his mouth curled up. He was in a certain wealthy merchant's storage room, in King's Avenue, in Paris. He used the Master Key to open the walls and doors that stood in his way with the power of the Sealed Artifact. He also used the key to open a door in a neighboring building of the terraces. He decided to go home and study the Card of Blasphemy once he was home. He took a taxi to the Royal Museum and then took a bus to a different part of the city to get away from the museum. He returned to the museum and went to the exhibition hall which housed Roselle's diary"}
{"num_chp":572,"summary":"After a series of chores, Klein opened his locked bedroom door and looked into the living room. He saw Danitz sleeping soundly on a reclining chair. The premise of him maintaining his lucidity in dreams had involved someone invading his consciousness. Typically, his dreams were a turbid mess, which meant that he alone wasn't able to complete the experiment. After all, he couldn't plant a psychological cue on himself.Therefore, he planned on using external forces to enter the dreams of others. Once he softly chanted an incantation that could stir the powers of nature, Danitz would definitely be awoken. He wanted to know if he could sense someone praying! He very quickly finished reciting The Fool's honorific name, but Klein didn't hear any noise. He frowned and analyzed whether it was really impossible or if he had a mistake somewhere. Relying on Hermes alone isn't sufficient. To achieve the effects of praying, I'll have to use a language like Hermes that can stir the power of nature. The Fool that doesn't belong to this era. The King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck. It's not even four in the afternoon! He couldn't help but lampoon Danitz for letting his hair down now that he doesn't need to monitor the radio transceiver. He originally planned on heading out to find a suitable target, but Danitz's posture was in such a perfect state that he could hardly stop himself from kicking him. Klein began to chant his honorific name in ancient Hermes. He wasn't afraid that there would be an accident, but that his stirring of the powers of nature would wake Blazing Danitz from his sleep. After seven to eight seconds, Danitz sat up in a daze as he muttered to himself in fear,Why did I dream of that madman Gehrman Sparrow causing trouble on the Golden Dream? It must be the result of me worrying over this matter all this time!Inside the bedroom, Klein had already taken four steps counterclockwise and gone above the gray fog. Without any surprises, he saw a rippling light by The Fool's high-back chair. In it was the scene of him in the dream. He considered if he should inform Miss Justice of the results of the experiment. But Miss Justice is the kind of girl with a huge sense of curiosity. She was excited instead of showing any doubts. Klein heaved a secretly sigh of relief and said, \"Use ancient Hermes.\" The figure faded away and gray fog vanished for two seconds before Audrey sat for stunned two seconds, afraid that she wasn't on her best behavior. She finally understood the perplexing matter and said \"Yes, Mr. Hanged Man and Ma'am Hermit had said. Do not make attempts without careful consideration.\" Before Audrey realized what was happening, she heard deep and majestic voice sound out again: \"If you encounter dangers in your dreams, you canite my Audrey excitedly took a few steps on the spot, believing that she had really become a Blessed of God. But she also remembered Mr. Fool's warning. She planned to understand more from the Psychology Alchemists and make another attempt only when she was sufficiently prepared. He originally planned on using the magic mirror, Arrodes, to find her, but now, he planned on mobilizing Sea God believers to perform a search. With waves reaching high into the sky as a background, he said in a deep voice, \"Find her and protect her. Be careful of Tracy's forces.\" He didn't provide further explanations as he broke down this scene along with red-haired Helene's photo into many sets before projecting them into the corresponding dots of light. He chose higher-ups like Kalat and Edmonton. The Sea God Scepter was summoned to help him find Helene, who had a reward worth 1,000 pounds. He had never done a mass revelation, so it was possible that it would be a burden that he couldn't withstand. But now that it involves a pirate admiral, it can barely make people guess that there are secret motives behind it. The information came from a Balam royal family's mausoleum... It should benefit Mr. Azik to a certain extent. I can also investigate the matter in passing...Klein found another reason to look forward to finding red-hair Helene."}

All he wanted was to immediately end the historical projection and escape from the Amon-no, Amons-in front of him. The charred corpse that had been \"Parasitized\" wiped the soot from its face. Before Klein disappeared, it said with a smile, \"There's no rush. You are just a projection from the Historical Void. I can't really parasitize you, and you should know very well that I'm not alone. It's difficult for you to launch an effective counterattack.\"With a simple lantern in hand, Klein thought silently. He picked up a piece of the black sculpture fragment that had red insides, and he cautiously asked, \"What exactly do you want to say?\" At that moment, Amon had already changed back into \"His\" appearance. The only problem was that \"His's\" skin remained darker. \"He\" adjusted his crystal monocle and chuckled. \"You can think of it that way too. If you have the time, you can wander around the Forsaken Land of the Gods. This should provide you with more clues. Of course, if you've the guts to enter Chernobyl, then you would know more.\" Klein didn't pursue the matter any further. \"Did the Dark Demonic Wolf hurriedly migrate because of the discovery of your existence?\" Why didn't you try to stop me from reviving there? \"Why did you send more powerful avatars over?\" \"If that happens, you'll choose to revive in the outside world. This will cause quite a bit of trouble for my follow-up tracking\" \"I'll have to enter Chernobyl one day to take a look, but I have to become a Miracle Invoker-doing so after I have self-preservation abilities to a certain degree; otherwise, I'll just be knocking on death's door\" \"To he didn't think he had any advantage in tracking this Mythical Creature, or his target's confidence in the situation, he was far inferior to Amon, who had been exploring the area for more than 1,000 years\" \"My only advantage is that I share the same pathway as the Dark Wolf, Furthermore I have Sefirah Castle, as well as the True Creator's Blesseds who had the benefit of this place being their home\" \"The only things that we need to consider are The Hanged Man and Ouroboros.\" \"What's your guess?\" \"Why don't you guess if I've turned back into my original form?\" \"I guess your other avatars are setting up a corresponding ritual to allow your true body to descend directly...\" \"Before he could finish his sentence, his figure rapidly turned incorporeal and dissipated. \"The Historical Void projection was dispelled\" There is a strong inclination for Beyonder characteristic convergence. This will have a certain effect on fate and judgment... However, Amon is a King of Angels of a neighboring pathway. There is also the law of Beyonder characteristics convergence between \"Him\" and the Dark Demonic Wolf. The effects won't be any weaker than mine... Klein considered carefully for a moment when he suddenly had an idea. He found his best advantage. He was very weak!Compared to Amon, the True Creator's attendant, and theDark Demonic Wolf, he was veryweak! Under normal circumstances, this was a disadvantage, but at times, it was possible that it could bring him something that he wanted. I can stir Sefirah Castle from time to time, leaving behind traces of the gray fog's aura as bait for the Dark demonic Wolf... The more he thought, the more viable he believed it was. If he wasn't careful, he might accidentally bait Amon or even the true Creator. And the Dark Satanic Wolf might very likely choose to observe first before suddenly launching an attack and not giving him a chance to prepare. Before taking this approach, I have to make sufficient preparations... There's no need to rush it... Taking a deep breath, Klein reached out his hand and pulled out the black demonic wolf sculpture's fragment that was red on the inside. He wanted to use the fragment to search for the hiding spot of the Dark Demon Wolf by analyzing it in reverse and figuring out its mod"}
{"num_chp":76,"summary":"Klein pulled out the final silver demon hunting bullet in his pocket and inserted it into the revolver's chamber. He pulled the trigger once again calmly, as though it was his usual daily practice. A grisly hole appeared on the suited clown's forehead as crimson red spewed out. The luster in his eyes dimmed as the intricate revolver's might was far higher than what Klein had imagined to be. As his knees buckled and his arms hung down, the suited Clown gradually fell to the ground. His eyes were frozen with a dazed look and his body convulsed a few times before it slowly relaxed and stopped moving. Klein stood up and casually asked, \"Is this restorative medicine?\" The sky-blue bottle was about the size of Klein's finger. It was not longer than five centimeters long and a cap that hid spiral patterns had fallen to the side. The liquid had completely spilled. Klein reached out to pick up the bottle and said, \"Mr. Harson, there are only a few drops left in the bottle.\" He pointed at a sky- blue metal bottle beside him and said in a self-deprecating laugh, \"I was trying to consume some medicine, but my hand shook...\" Then, he pointed at the bottle. \"It's the Goddess's Gaze. Remember to drink half a bottle.\" Klein did not delay as he turned around and arrived at Borgia who was groaning in pain. Klein found the sky-blue metal bottle from the Nighthawk's pocket. After removing the cap, he carefully held the bottle to Borgia's mouth. The medicine was rather effective. It only took Borgia a few seconds after drinking to regain the spirit in his eyes. With that said, he whispered, \"Thank you\" as he slowly sat up. He first dealt with his wounds before walking to the unconscious Lorotta and Dunn. Then, he retrieved the Goddess's Gaze from the latter's inner pocket. He turned around and jogged to the \"poet,\" Leonard Mitchell. Leonard smiled as he went past Klein and walked to the awakening Dunn and Lorotta. He then returned to Aiur's side and fed him the remaining half bottle. Aiur panted a few times, his actions suddenly became nimbler. He stood up as though he had never been injured. He said, \"I'll help Borgia. Help that partner of yours.\" The gentleman with the charm of a middle-aged man pointed at Leonard Mitchell and pointed at Aiur. \"I actually wanted to save you but discovered that you didn't need it. There are many special people in this world that can always do things others can't, such as you...\" Aiur said. \"Don't mind it. I can drink it by myself.\" Leonard smiled. \"Let's store this notebook and Sealed Artifact 2-049 behind Tingen's Chanis Gate. Dunn, Leonard, and Klein, who had mustered his courage, began searching the suited clown's corpse. They found paper flowers, handkerchiefs, poker cards, glass pieces, and all sorts of strange items. However, apart from that, he did not seem to carry anything of worth or potential clues. They searched the innermost warehouse and saw that there were a splotches of bloody flesh that looked like they had been smashed by boulders. They also saw one white bone after another that had been strewn everywhere. Dunn inhaled and said while hiding his pain, \"Leonard, you are still in good condition. Stay here and do not allow ordinary people to come close... The rest of us will immediately search for items among Ray Bieber's remains. We will return with them and the Sealed Artifact, as well as the Antigonus family's notebook. We'll then get Frye, Royale, and the police to come here.\" They then turned around and arrived beside Sealed. Artifact 2-049. They woke each other up and stuffed the puppet which had resumed moving into the black chest with an opening as they monitored it strictly. The puppet flipped over with its body creaking as it aligned its clown-painted face with the light source. On the creepy face, under the black pupil-less eyes, two hardly noticeable crimson cracks appeared. \"Everything is back to normal.\" Aiur sounded a little more relaxed."}

Right, you guys don't need any business...Klein drew closer as he complained silently and knocked on the table just beside the girl's ear. The girl with brown hair read pretentiously and gave her opinion. The steam train service \u2018Soaring Express' that directly reaches Constant City is starting operations today. The Captain is on watch at the \u2018Chanis Gate' and is unable to leave at the moment. \"I really don't want to take the ship there again, it's too awful, really awful... Hey, who are you?\" Klein said as he took down his hat to his chest and bowed slightly. \"Hello, I am Klein Moretti, and I am here at the invitation of Dunn Smith\" \"We still have to go down a few levels,\" the girl said, pointing to a small corridor with three offices on each side. \"The level of service awareness is worrying,\" Klein said. \"Although I am often afraid of falling down, tumbling down like a barrel.

Oh yes, it was hilarious if it was about it was you think about it Rozanne was a member of the Nighthawks, who sacrificed himself in an accident five years ago. Klein had always been a little afraid of him, even though he is amiable, a fatherly figure. The path to the left will lead to the Saint Selena Cathedral; to the right are the armory, storeroom, and archives. And straight ahead is the Chanis Gate. The Church of the Evernight Goddess in Tingen was a sacred ground where local followers yearned to visit. It was akin to how soldiers and officers were sent to court martial for trials. Violators were tried in the courts of the Church. The contract was confidential, and most of them had been mentioned by Dunn Smith on the confidential clause. \"A five year contract. People like it a contract now.\" Dunn Smith said, then took out two copies of the contract and showed them to Klein. \"I hope to have the honor, but still it depends on what Mr. Smith has to say,\" Klein said as he sized up the enclosed surroundings. \"Come and have a seat. Have you decided? Are you certain you want to join us?\" Dunn smiled and asked as he put down the newspaper. \"Yes, I am certain.\" Klein removed his hat and bowed to Dunn, then he took a look at his deed. He then took a deep breath to calm himself and said, \"I will join you in a few minutes.\" Two pounds and 10 soli for weekly wages, ten soli as compensation for the risk and confidentiality... Klein read through it and answered resolutely, \"I've no problem with it.\" \"Welcome, from now on, you are one of us, and please note that the contract is confidential as well,\" Dunn said. \"What happens if someone really comes here due to the \u2018Blackthorn Security Company' signboard and requests for our services?\" Klein asked. \"We'll take those requests; why shouldn't we? As long as it doesn't affect our daily operations?\" Dunn said slowly and humorously. \"Any earnings would be considered additional bonuses, so our members are quite willing to take those jobs. Anyway, the market for trivial and troublesome matters such as finding dogs and cats have been monopolized by private detectives.\" \"So, Captain, what do you mean by Beyonders losing control? Why does it happen?\" \"There aren't many supernatural incidents, so there are even fewer Beyonders. There are only six formal members of the Nighthawks in the entire Tingen City, including me.\" \"As for civilian staff, there are six including you.\" \"Yes, I shall be addressing you as Captain?\" \"Yes,\" Klein replied. \"Yes.\" \"I'm Klein Moretti.

They were leaning against the backs of their seats, motionless. Their faces were pale and their eyes wide open. Although there wasn't any sounds of breathing, the corners of their lips were curved up, revealing eight teeth. The police followed the duty manager and warily entered the front carriage. All of them held their hands to their waists as they pressed onto their holsters. All they wished was to turn around and leave, beginning investigations only when it was bright. The inspector was about to emphasize his orders when he suddenly noticed something amiss. The steam locomotive staff members who were in their seats still had their eyes open with their whites showing. However, their mouths had closed at some point and were no longer showing their teeth. Gehrman had transformed into a single-seater Sparrow and was sitting on a single chair in a single room in the Gehrmann Hotel. The train driver and the train conductor were also on the train, but they had not been seen for some time. The railway duty manager in a blue coat held a lamp, walking as he briefed the police about the situation. He said, \"For some reason, after the passengers disembarked, all the train staff, including the train driver, returned to the carriage and never came out again\" The police could easily tell the extreme horror in him After advancing to Sequence 4, Klein was able to read the thoughts of his marionette's superficial consciousness. He could also use the increased control of Spirit Body Threads to do things similar to spirit channeling. After an unknown period of time, the night grew deeper. The cloth doll with curved eyes and mouth moved its limbs and slowly stood up. Klein instantly transformed into another train attendant and stood with the row of cultists. The man with the red, lumpy cheek then took out an item from an inner pocket. He then said, \"He' gave a revelation through a divine item, requesting us to sacrifice many lives to pleasure \u2018Him.' In return, \u2018He' will give us eternal life in \u2018His' kingdom\" The train attendants' death would've been discovered, and preparations made. If it's the latter, perhaps nothing has been detected... Klein contemplated for a moment and made Enzo place the cloth door on the desk in front of the window. It was a cloth doll of shabby craftsmanship with curvedeyes and mouth. Klein thought of many possibilities before getting Enzo to take the cloth doll and scrutinize it carefully, but he didn't discover anything odd. That meant that there were two possibilities: First, someone was using the doll as a decoy while acting as a deity nearby. Second, it was a truly secret existence who had specially labeled the item to send a revelation."}

The scene he saw was a transparent, ethereal figure. It had a single eye, a trait unique to giants. It was facing down, the single red glow of the giant had a faint glow, causing him to kneel in pain. His hands involuntarily reached out to protect his head as though he had been struck in the head with a bat. He recovered several seconds later and stood back up. He was in a dreamlike state. His eyes turned completely black as he recited a divination statement in his heart, \"The formula to the Clown potion\" He was now in a state of Cogitation. He had created a portal to the underworld. He could see through it to the other side. He saw the light of day. He felt it. He heard it. The light of the day had returned. He knew it was the day of the resurrection. He stood up and said, \"It's time for me to go.\" He was back in the real world. He returned to his office. Klein felt that his spirituality was unusually weak, as if he had heard the murmurings that penetrated his mind once again. But due to his progress in \u2018digesting' the magic medicine, the adverse reaction calmed down quickly. He noticed that there was still an obvious wart on Sirius's mangled face. It was a dark purple wart, almost black. There seemed to be liquid and a light gleaming within. Klein rubbed his temples, not daring to touch it. He bent over and retrieved his cane, allowing it to bear his weight. He knew that Sirius's spirituality had been completely destroyed. Even the Spirit Medium Daly would be unable to communicate with him. After a while, Klein saw Captain Dunn and his partners, Leonard and Kenley. They asked, \"You tried channeling his spirit?\" Klein replied truthfully. \"I was worried that you would arrive and that the short remains of his spirituality would scatter.\" He passed Sirius's undivered letter to the captain and passed the remains of the late late late Selena to them. The Captain saw a huge cross in Hanass' dream. The terrifying being crucified on the cross wasn't the Aurora Order's Hanged Giant...Klein took two deep breaths and waited for his spirituality to slowly recover. His initial theory was that Sirius was a Secrets Suppliant. He thought about the red chimney he had seen in his dream divination, as well as the majestic palace on the main peak of \"I saw a pendulum that took the shape of a Hanged Giant. I saw a blood-red glow flash in the giant's only eye before I was forced out of the ritual,\" Klein described honestly. He didn't want to talk about the Clown potion for the time being as he had two considerations. First, if Dunn and the rest were able to find Sirius's hideout and the corresponding records, then it would make no difference if he told them or not. This way, he would be awarded with another contribution, allowing him to acquire the ingredients needed to concoct a potion. This was a way to obtain double the rewards for a single task, a technique that stemmed from Old Neil's recent teachings. After leaving the Daffodil Street Library, Klein nearly fell asleep in the carriage. He then removed his hat and jacket before falling asleep on the sofa. He woke up abruptly, took out his pocket watch, and snapped it open. \"Melissa will be back in half an hour, Benson in forty-five minutes... If I don't get up, I'll have to make them wait an hour before we can have dinner...\" Klein rubbed his forehead as he entered the kitchen. \"I am a man who just saved Tingen...\" Klein mumbled in amusement. \"Not bad.

This way, Klein believed that, even if the Rose School of Thought angel wished to, it was impossible to use divination to lock onto his position via Admiral of Blood. \"She\" could've mutated Senor during the demigod battle royale in order to deal with him. Based on the situation back then, there was a guaranteed chance of success. Klein was like a jobless tramp who was debt-laden. He felt that there was almost nothing he was afraid of. He didn't carry anything else with him that he didn't want to carry on him for the rest of his life. He wasn't afraid of anything. He was just accustomed to doing so, as it gave him a feeling like he was truly controlling a puppet. He had a feeling that there weren't any latent problems with the Spirit Body Threads, which meant that there wasn't any need to use both hands to control them. He took out Azik's copper whistle from inside his body. He turned his right wrist and made the side with fewer patterns appear under the sunlight, making it reflect the light. The copper whistle had Senor's figure appear on it as it rapidly turned clear. The grayish-white fog was quickly emanated as hysterical Klein considered cashing out Admiral of Blood via the black market. He immediately used divination to gain the gist of its origins and usage. After dying at the hands of a Rose School of Thought demigod, this gentleman's Beyonder characteristic and psyche fused with an ordinary silver necklace that he carried with him, turning into a mystical item. The mystical item had two uses. One was to passively make the wearer lucky. The second use was to actively give an enemy bad luck, making the target unlucky. After being lucky, they would immediately meet with repeated bad luck. After all, Fate Councilor Ricciardo was unable to change my luck... Hmm, I'll just wear it on me for now. It has few negative effects on me. I'll sell it if there's a chance to pay off my debt with Miss Messenger. Miss Messenger wants gold coins, while I have gold pounds. It's nearly impossible to exchange 10,000 gold coins through the banks or official markets. From the looks of it, I will have to do it in batches, getting each Tarot Club member to change some of it...Klein soon decided on a name for the necklace:Scales of Luck!Following that, he cast his gaze onto Senor, who was standing reverently to his side. He began to study the powers a Wraith had. Forceful possession, Wraith's Shriek, Mirror Blink, Obstacle Penetration, death-related spells, On its reflective side was Senor's figure. Then, Klein brought the gold coin, Azik's copper whistle, Death Knell, and his suitcase back to the real world. As for Creeping Hunger and Groselle's Travels, one of them hadn't been fed, and the other might cause Klein to be swallowed into the book for carrying it for too long. Therefore, they were left in the junk pile above the gray fog. He followed the beach until he came to a residential area. He discovered that he was near Pritz Harbor. Instead, he changed his appearance, took a steam locomotive, and headed for Conant City in Desi Bay. He planned on circling the area once before changing his identity again. He saw that the buildings had completely collapsed, and there were deep chasms in the ground and charred spots everywhere. He jumped off the Blue Avenger and circled the ruins with his sailors, but they didn't discover anything of value. After an unknown period of time, a figure suddenly walked out from the depths of the ruins. He wore a double-breasted, pure black clerical robe. His facial features were clear and distinct, like an ancient, classical sculpture. His eyes were dark blue, nearing black. They looked lusterless, but were filled with dense blood capillaries. He soon boarded the ship which hoisted its sails and left the island. The plans to rebuild the harbor wasn't brought forward at all."}
{"num_chp":920,"summary":"The Hanged Man Alger met with Admiral of Stars Cattleya. The two sat across each other, facing each other without saying a word. The Hanging Man felt an indescribable pressure as he thought of the death of Vice Admiral Hurricane Qilangos. He believed that it was done by a Sequence 4 or Sequence 3 demigod, in other words, a saint. He also felt horrified that Mr. Fool's Blessed was a High-Sequence Beyonder. He secretly gulped his saliva with great difficulty, believing that he had underestimated Mr Fool back then as that Blessed wasn't a Grounded but one that shared the three crowns of the various orthodox Churches' crowns. His thoughts shimmered as his eyes churned as his thoughts churned, and he felt his pupils dilate as he felt the pressure in his eyes. His pupils dilated. He felt the Pressure in his pupils. He thought of something, something that left a deep impression on him. He shook his head and said, \"I was trying to figure out the exact situation when I saw your signal, so I rushed here to meet you.\" The Hanged man then left the slums and returned to the Church of Storms, where he worked as a member of the Church's secret society. He was still there when he met with the Admiral of Star's, who asked, \"Have you heard the news about Gehrman Sparrow and Admiral Hell?\" Klein planned on getting Ludwell to take off his silver mask. The silver mask was too striking. If he didn't deal with it, there was no amount of disguising that could direct the attention of others away from it. The more powerful the marionette, the more famous they were while alive. Bringing one along with me has the risk of being exposed... If it wasn't because I didn't have the time to finish off the pirates on the Black Tulip, I would have had the means to keep it under wraps. For example, I could continue letting Ludwell be the captain while I pretend to be his subordinate. To a Faceless, that's very simple... Klein sighed as he passed through the forest. There were many mosquitoes around him, but none of them came for him. All of them were circling Admiral Hell Ludwell, trying to suck his blood in vain. It was as though the real world had overlapped with the spirit world. In about ten seconds, tapping sounds sounded out: \"Exalted Master, your servant, Arrodes, is here to answer your summoning. There's no danger temporarily\" There was no danger at all! The spirit world was temporarily temporarily in danger. The real world's danger was temporarily temporary. It had been caused by the presence of the Beyonders, who were trying to control the world's natural resources. The world's real world was in danger because of the lack of food and water. Klein finally confirmed that he had connected to the magic mirror, Arrodes. He asked, \"What do you know of Calder\u00f3n City in the spirit world?\" A piece of illusory white paper exited the radio transceiver in a hesitant manner: \"I can't see that city too clearly. I do not know its exact state, but I can confirm that a saint had perished in there before. There were also certain angels, Travelers, and spirit world creatures who had once entered to explore it and left it alive in a relatively smooth manner. However, none of them got much out of it. The name \u2018Calder\u00f3n' originates from the Abraham family's angel, the first person who stepped in. In the Language of the Dead, it means \u2018Unknown Soul.'\" Klein nodded in a reserved manner before asking. \"What say you?\" \"I want to have a child with you.\" he replied. \"Indeed.\" Klein asked. \"Do you know the origins of that city?\" \"Yes. It was a grounded divine kingdom of the ancient goddess, Phoenix Ancestor Gregrace.\" Klein nodded. \"Yes.\" \"The City of the dead gradually became the holy grounds of \u2018Her' descendants and believers.\" \"I know that. What do you say?\" Klein asked, and a piece of white paper spat out amidst clicking sounds. \"I say that I know that the city is called Calder\u00f3n.\""}
{"num_chp":819,"summary":"Klein and Hazel began dancing with their backs straight. As they twirled, he casually said, \"I often had nightmares some time ago, but thankfully I had the Goddess's blessings. I prayed a few times at the cathedral and drank a few cups of holy water, and after that, I stopped jolting awake.\" Hazel didn't say a word, but her bright, brown eyes were colored with dissent. Klein believed that Hazel might have made contact with something or had caught the fancy of some powerful Beyonder due to her personality. Through dreams, she was slowly guided to become a Beyonder, without giving her the necessary knowledge. At the same time, the entity enticed her to dig in the sewers to search for something. The deeper meaning was that Hazel could find a divination club member or a cathedral's priest to interpret her dream if she was troubled by it. It was best not to make rash choices while blindly believing the contents of the dream. He had fabricated the story from his experience as a Seer. His goal was to pique Hazel's interest to see if she would unknowingly reveal something. Otherwise, it was hard to explain how, despite being at least a Sequence 8, she had a severe lack of knowledge towards the mysterious world with her blind arrogance. She was a lady from high society who had been educated at home. She likely had no lack of Beyonders around her. After nearly ten seconds, she asked, \"Why didn Klein and Hazel were at a ball hosted by the Church of Evernight Goddess. Bishop Elektra was enjoying a glass of red wine. Klein was worried that he might offend the Coim Company and Baron Syndras. He was planning to deal with the Keepers, as well as contemplating how to steal something from the core seal behind Chanis Gate. Xio came home with Feynapotter pies and Desi Bay sweet ice tea. She told Fors, \"Don't eat too much of such food. It's unhealthy. As a bounty hunter, maintaining one's figure is a necessity.\" Xio hesitated for a moment before pulling a pie to her mouth. She then said, \"Perhaps, you might've missed out on your final opportunity to grow taller as a result. Oh right, I heard that the Warrior pathway has an effective way of raising a person's height\" Xio was taken aback as she suddenly sighed, \"But I was born as a half-Arererer, half-Bounty Hunter.\" She then picked up a pie stuffed with fruits and ham before taking a bite. \"It's obvious just from looking at those barbarians from Feysac that I'm a Beyonder geared for combat,\" she said. \"I was also born as an Arerer,\" she added, \"but I was taken as aHalfArerner, half bounty hunter. It was a region that held faith in the God of Steam and Mach Xio knew that her friend had been out recently, claiming that she was doing something for her teacher. She was to randomly pretend to head out two days a week, and she would secretly observe what Fors was doing. Xio repressed her excitement and anticipation as she headed out as per normal. She planned on heading to a specific spot to leave a corresponding mark to schedule a meeting with the masked man from MI9. Then, she planned on returning home to tail Fors, so that she could figure out what her good friend was up to, or if she was in any danger. However, the moment she entered East Borough, she had a hunch that someone was staring at her. As Xio muttered, she eventually reached out and took the Interrogator Beyonder characteristic. She needed the correct formula to advance to Sequence 7. It would be a crucial step for her investigation of the truth and restoring her family's honor. Therefore, she was eager to receive a few more missions from the military to accumulate the amount of contributions she needed. She had a feeling that Fors had considered becoming a Warrior in the past, but she didn't want to ruin her reputation by revealing her past. She decided to wait until her birthday, which was less than a year away, before asking Fors for a present. She opened a metal box under Xio's doubtful gaze, one that was used to store cigars.

{"num_chp":1367,"summary":"Klein used Sefirah Castle's status to resist the laws of Calder\u00f3n City which turned all living beings into the dead. He used the Marauder pathway's Beyonder powers to steal the distance of his perception so as to avoid being entangled with the various dangerous monsters that were active in this mysterious city. After surveying the area, Klein raised his hand to summon the Historical Void projection from a few minutes ago, allowing his true body to return to SefIRah Castle. He then pulled out the Staff of the Stars's historical projection and stepped deep into the city. He could only vaguely see some visions when using divination or making a prophecy. He couldn't accurately make a judgment. He didn't know what state Amon was in right now, so he didn't dare delay. After his mental problems were resolved, he immediately came to Calder\u00f3n. City and prepared to obtain the river water of the River of Eternal Darkness. It was very likely that in the deepest depths of the city flowed the River Of Eternal Darkness, so once they approached anywhere close to the bottom, there was the possibility of a mutation of the essence of a marionette. None of the monsters in this city dared to appear too much at a time, so they allowed their instinct to overcome their desire to live and their habits of hunting. Even their cold, decadent surroundings were gloomy, cold and decadent, and were like a black-and-white film. Klein's intuition told him that once he got used to this environment, his body and mind would become still and silent. He carried the Staff of the Stars and entered the palace through the open door. On both sides of the hall were different types of coffins in different colors. They sat there silently, as if they had already been weathered by death. There was a sudden noise coming from inside the coffins. It sounded like a rusted joint opening. The aura of Sefirah Castle around him expanded out of reflex and became extremely thick, like a grayish-white cocoon. At the same time, Klein turned his head slightly and heard a faint, illusory whooshing sound. This seemed to indicate that a dark river was slowly flowing deep underground not far from him. Even if a Sequence 0 true deity were to approach the River of Eternal Darkness, they would be trapped there and unable to escape. Although they would still be imprisoned by this abstract river, this sefirah. wouldn't dissipate, they wouldn't be able to escape, as even light couldn't exist on its surface. Without any sefirot protection, merely approaching the river will result in a terrifying mutation... Klein retracted his gaze and tidied up the golden bird-shaped accessory attached to his breast pocket. He didn't steal the distance again, to prevent himself from slamming headfirst into danger. He walked past the bronze statue's stone monument and walked Klein's expression turned solemn. After pausing for a few seconds, he continued down. This time, the rising illusory tide drowned him, causing his body to turn light and his emotions to quickly turn cold. At the end was a void. Amidst the emptiness flowed a straight, wide, colorless, dark river. This river was so blurry that it was difficult to see it clearly. This was because its surroundings were covered with a swath of grayish-white like a thin layer of fog. He was no stranger to this kind of fog; he had seen it behind the door in Bansy's ruins before. And unlike other places, there was a portion of the water from the River of Eternal Darkness that penetrated the fog and fused to some extent with the latter, changing colors between dark-black and pale-white. At this moment, countless blurry, translucent figures were pacing back and forth, slowly but unceasingly. Among them, the most eye-catching one was a seemingly lost figure that would occasionally enter into the depths of the distributary before turning around. Yet, it didn't seem like it could leave the river. It was huge, similar to the stone pillars around it. It had a heavy black robe draped over it, and from its side profile, it looked very old. The face had obvious Southern Continent characteristics, but it had already rotted while white feathers stained with pale yellow oil grew out."}

After thinking to no avail, he decided to approach it from another angle. He first recalled the people who had abnormal luck around him to see if there were any connections. A series of circumstances surfaced in Klein's mind as he quickly came to a conclusion. This is Angel of Fate Ouroboros's attempt to search for Snake of Mercury Will Auceptin! He is driving the members of the Aurora Order to help \"Him\" find him. This implies that behind Mr. X, there's a King of Angels existing somewhere in Backlund. He then immediately returned to the real world, and he carefully took out the extremely fragile paper crane from his wallet before gently unfolding it and placing it under his pillow. After doing all of that, he had the time to calculate how much cash he had. 17,046 pounds, 5 gold coins, 3 soli, and 8 change in change would make me quite a tycoon. Of course, I'm still very far from being a top tycoon, being a house, manor, and company, and having many many many liquid assets would make him quite a top-class tycoon... But still, it's nice to know that I'm not the only one with a lot of money. Klein woke up and saw the desolate black plains. He walked all the way to the pitch-black steeple in the middle of the plains, passing through the chaotic and abnormal layout before coming deep into the steeple. Like before, there was a circle of tarot cards on the ground. However, the protruding area in themiddle of the tarOT cards didn't have any silvery lines written. Then why did he pull me into this dream?Amidst Klein's puzzlement, he suddenly saw a black baby pram roll out of the shadows. In it was an infant whose looks were indiscernible while it was wrapped in silver silk!...Mr. Snake of Fate? Klein politely and cautiously asked. The infant immediately said in a clear voice, \"What makes you so sure it's a mister?\" \"Isn't that determined from your name? Don't mind such details!Klein lampooned and relaxed due to the attitude he was given. \"I've been playing hide-and-seek with \u2018Him' for a very long time. \u2018He' isn't good at such matters,\" Will Auceptin scoffed. \"Every time I start again, I try to make myself a little different, so as to maintain a good mental state\" \"Do you know how to use the Worm of Time to create charms?\" Klein asked. \"Pallez Zoroast isn't in good condition, and he had to paras Will Auceptin said, \"The creation of a Worm of Time charm isn't too difficult for you. You can pray to that uniqueness trait about you and use a compound of mercury and pure silver as a medium to draw the corresponding symbols\" The mysterious space above the gray fog clearly has a form of attraction to the Marauder pathway. Klein was thrilled as he felt like he had grasped something. But Will suddenly opened his mouth and let out a cry. He began wailing like a real infant. He stopped crying and said with a laugh, \"Of course, but I'll swap it ahead of time. Otherwise, everyone will die on the spot.\" He paused for a moment before saying, \"If you can give me something suitable, it's not impossible to give you one drop of blood.\"\"Alright, goodbye!\" Klein said as the steeple shake as the dream rapidly shattered. \"It's only a prank. Haha, it would've been fine even if he hadn't taken action. I would've given your former colleague sufficient good luck at the critical moment.\" \"Leonard is investigating Sherlock Moriarty? The Grandpa in his body is called Pallez Zoroast...Klein frowned slightly, unsure where the problem stemmed from. \"I sensed that there was something problematic about him and had given him a short period of bad luck, causing him to encounter other demigods hidden in Backlund\" \"I've no idea what the corresponding symbol is, I"}
{"num_chp":629,"summary":"Klein could've fed Creeping Hunger with Cynthia's remnant flesh and Spirit Body, but at that moment, he sighed and said with a calm voice, \"Try not to make contact with strange artifacts or religions in the future.\" He didn't dare to channel Cynthia's spirit after what had happened. Faced with the irremovable evil and the ever-worsening corruption, he could only choose to have Cynthia be cleansed. After all, in this world with true gods, there might exist a heaven after death. After spending a long time with it, this mystical item which had been sealed to a certain extent had adjusted to him. It had been restored to its original state. Once it was activated, it just needed to eat once in a twenty-four-hour period, regardless of how many times it was used. Of course, there was no need for it to be fed on the day it wasn't used. Klein had plenty of time to seek out food for CreepingHunger without harming the innocent. The bodyguards and the male and female attendants in the room had shaken off the influence of their magnified desires, and they had fallen unconscious. This included the maidservant who was strangling her companion in a bid to obtain her approval and praise, as well as blond secretary, Luan. Even he was so easily controlled his magnified desire, which means that the power that descended with the help of Cynthia is extremely potent. Klein made a preliminary conjecture based on the pendant's situation and from his past experience. He dispelled the prohibition from the charm before walking towards Secretary Luan, who still had some signs of corruption due to temporarily being devoured by the flowers. \"Wake up all the lightly injured people. Get a number of them to treat the remaining people while the others are to investigate the Heavenly Body Sect on Oravi Island,\" Klein said. \"I'll be waiting in the study for the report,\" he added. \"This fellow's arrogant way of looking down on others sure is irritating. I really want to beat him up,\" said Luan. \"There was no need to busy themselves!\" said Klein. \"It was just a bad dream!\" said the secretary. \"You can't tell dream from reality. You can't help but have the starry sky and the bright, lustrous star surface in his mind\" \"Yes,\" said Klein, \"It's a good dream.\" \"No, it's not,\" replied the secretary, \"it's a bad nightmare.\" \"Yes, it is,\" replied Klein. 'It's just a dream.' \"No. It's not a real dream,\" the secretary replied. 'I can't believe you're saying that.\" \"I'm sorry,\" Klein replied, 'I didn't mean to offend you. I'm so sorry' \"Yes\" \"It is a real bad dream,\" he said, \"but it Klein was alarmed as he said in a stoic tone, \"Bring him here.\"Secretary Luan knocked before entering. He bowed his head and coldly reported, \"Your Excellency. We've already found the Heavenly Body Sect and captured their leader. Their leader is a Beyonder, a Sequence 8 Lunatic.\" Klein didn't think further as he recalled the details of the past few days while awaiting the results of his subordinates' investigations. He suddenly thought of a concept. It was something important back when he was first educated in mysticism but had never received a detailed description or explanation! That was the astral world!Apart from the Life School of Thought and a few other organizations' belief in uncommon concepts such as the world of absolute rationality, most schools of thought believed that the world was comprised of the real world, the spirit world, and the astrial world. Knowledge of thespirit world was the foundation of many ritualistic magic and Beyonder powers. Klein's knowledge about it was basically zero.Therefore, the illusory starry sky represents the astRAL world. The bright star is a particular existence in theAstral world? I've always suspected that the Astral world is where the true gods reside. Then, this imagery which represents the Primordial Moon isn't something unacceptable...Klein didn't thinking further. He was waiting for his subordinates to find the leader of the sect. He didn't know what to do."}

He felt the air around him suddenly become thick and heavy. A shimmering wave of light appeared around him, coming from the deep blue water that filled the area. At the bottom of the sea was an ancient, dark ruin. All the buildings had either collapsed or half-collapsed. A huge pillar, carved with strange patterns and symbols, extended out from the middle. It was the hiding place of Sea God Kalvetua, a hidden place where reality blended with the spirit world. However, this also means that the Church of Storms and the kingdom's military haven't found this place yet. He activated the Sun Brooch's Holy Oath, and through the corresponding word in ancient Hermes, he temporarily added a Holy attribute to the damage he dealt with his attacks. He then drew a clear grayish-white crack on the enemy's body.Pure golden flames silently rose from within the crack, wrapping around the Sea God Guard and burning it until it was on the verge of collapse.Behind him, the completely desiccated Sea God Guards finally collapsed, turning into ashes within the golden flames. He was wearing a black crown and black armor. The guards no longer moved.Amidst the chaos, one after the other, the guards fell down, one by one, and no other, after the guards were no longer moving. He went up the steps and entered the building where the pillars were. An old man wearing a clergyman's cap was lying beside Kalvetua's body. His hair was gray, and his body was like a gray rock. He stuck his face tightly to the serpent's body, making incomprehensible sounds from his throat. His actions were an unknown. Around the gigantic serpent's corpse were dessicated corpses. They were similar to the Sea God Guards outside, but they were even more bizarre. Their stomachs bulged to the point of rupturing. Their mouths were stained with dark red blood and had strips of bluish meat hanging from them. The blue dots of light also leaked out from their bodies, rushing towards the white fang that was gradually straightening up. Klein frowned, roughly understanding what was happening. He looked down from the surviving priest's face to see his belly bulging like a pregnant woman's. A strong burgeoning and contraction appeared there, resembling a huge heart. The guards had problems with a potion overdose or conflicting pathway characteristics. They broke down on the spot and died completely.
